[far so definitely register there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m09s)
00:02:09

[and start getting involved you'll get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m12s)
00:02:12

[lot more out of this course if you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m14s)
00:02:14

[that so we're going to start by doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m16s)
00:02:16

[some coding this is an approach we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m22s)
00:02:22

[going to be talking about in the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m24s)
00:02:24

[called the top-down approach to study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m26s)
00:02:26

[but let's learn it by doing it so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m29s)
00:02:29

[go ahead and try and actually train a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m33s)
00:02:33

[neural network now in order to train a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m35s)
00:02:35

[neural network you almost certainly want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m38s)
00:02:38

[a GPU GPU of is a graphics processing a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m41s)
00:02:41

[graphics processing unit it's the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m45s)
00:02:45

[that companies use to help you play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m48s)
00:02:48

[games better they let your computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[render the game much more quickly than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m56s)
00:02:56

[your CPU okay we'll be talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m58s)
00:02:58

[them more shortly but for now I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m01s)
00:03:01

[to show you how you can get access to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m04s)
00:03:04

[GPU specifically you're going to need an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m06s)
00:03:06

[NVIDIA GPU because only NVIDIA GPUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m11s)
00:03:11

[support something called cooter cooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[is the language and framework that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m17s)
00:03:17

[nearly all deep learning libraries and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m19s)

[practitioners use to do their work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[obviously it's not ideal that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[stuck with one particular vendors cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m28s)
00:03:28

[and over time we hope to see more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m30s)
00:03:30

[competition in this base but for now we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m32s)
00:03:32

[do need an NVIDIA GPU your laptop almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m34s)
00:03:34

[certainly doesn't have one unless you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m38s)
00:03:38

[specifically went out of your way to buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m40s)
00:03:40

[like a gaming laptop so almost certainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m42s)
00:03:42

[you will need to rent one and the good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m46s)
00:03:46

[news is that renting access paying by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m50s)

[the second or a GPU based computer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m53s)
00:03:53

[pretty easy and pretty cheap I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m55s)
00:03:55

[to show you a couple of options the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m59s)
00:03:59

[first option I'll show you which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m03s)
00:04:03

[probably the easiest is called Kressel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m06s)
00:04:06

[if you go to kress allcom and click on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[sign up or if you've been there before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m15s)
00:04:15

[sign-in you will find yourself at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m16s)
00:04:16

[screen which has a big button that says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m19s)

[start jupiter and another switch called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m22s)
00:04:22

[enable GP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m24s)
00:04:24

[you so if we make sure that is set to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m25s)
00:04:25

[true the Nabal GPU is on and we click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[start Jupiter and we click start Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m30s)
00:04:30

[it's going to launch us into something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m37s)
00:04:37

[called Jupiter notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m39s)
00:04:39

[Jupiter notebook in a recent survey of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m40s)
00:04:40

[tens of thousands of data scientists was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m44s)
00:04:44

[rated as the third most important tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m46s)
00:04:46

[in the data scientist toolbox it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m48s)
00:04:48

[really important that you get to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m51s)
00:04:51

[it well and all of our courses will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m52s)
00:04:52

[run through Jupiter yes Rachel you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m54s)
00:04:54

[a question or a comment I just wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m57s)
00:04:57

[point out that you get I believe 10 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m59s)
00:04:59

[hours so if you wanted to tricresyl out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m01s)
00:05:01

[yeah he might have changed that recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m06s)
00:05:06

[to less hours but you can check the FAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m10s)
00:05:10

[or the pricing but you certainly get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m12s)
00:05:12

[some three hours the pricing varies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m13s)
00:05:13

[because this is actually runs on top of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m16s)
00:05:16

[Amazon Web Services so at the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m18s)
00:05:18

[it's 60 cents an hour the nice thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m19s)
00:05:19

[though that you can always turn it turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m24s)
00:05:24

[it on you know start your Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m25s)
00:05:25

[without the CP without the GPU running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m27s)
00:05:27

[and pay you a tenth of that price which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m29s)
00:05:29

[is pretty cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m31s)
00:05:31

[so Jupiter notebook is something we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[be doing all of this course in and so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m36s)
00:05:36

[get started here we're going to find our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m38s)
00:05:38

[particular course so we're go to courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m40s)
00:05:40

[and would go to fast a o2 and there they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m42s)
00:05:42

[are things have been moving around a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m48s)
00:05:48

[little bit so it may be in a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m51s)
00:05:51

[spot for you when you look at this and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m52s)
00:05:52

[we'll make sure all the information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[current information is on the website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m56s)
00:05:56

[now having said that that's you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m59s)
00:05:59

[crystal approach is you know as you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m02s)
00:06:02

[see it's basically instant and and easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m05s)
00:06:05

[but if you've got you know an extra hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m08s)
00:06:08

[or so to get going and even better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m13s)
00:06:13

[option is something called paper space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m16s)
00:06:16

[paper space unlike Chris or doesn't run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m22s)
00:06:22

[on top of Amazon they have their own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m25s)
00:06:25

[machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m26s)
00:06:26

[and if I click on so here's here's paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m32s)
00:06:32

[space and so if I click on new machine I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m36s)
00:06:36

[can pick which one of the three data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m38s)
00:06:38

[centers to use so pick that one closest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m41s)
00:06:41

[to you so I'll say a West Coast and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m43s)
00:06:43

[I'll say Linux and I'll say Ubuntu 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m47s)
00:06:47

[and then it says choose machine and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m51s)
00:06:51

[can see there's various different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m54s)
00:06:54

[machines I can choose from and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m55s)
00:06:55

[pay-by-the-hour so this is pretty cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m58s)

[than cresol I get a machine that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m04s)
00:07:04

[actually going to be much faster than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m07s)

00:07:12

[I'm going to actually show you how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m15s)
00:07:15

[get started with the paper space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m17s)
00:07:17

[approach because that actually is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m19s)
00:07:19

[to do everything from scratch you may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m22s)
00:07:22

[find if you trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m26s)
00:07:26

[do the 65 cents an hour one that it may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m27s)
00:07:27

[require you to contact paper space to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m30s)
00:07:30

[say like why do you want it and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m32s)
00:07:32

[just an anti fraud the thing so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m34s)
00:07:34

[say faster AI there then they'll quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m36s)
00:07:36

[get you up and running so I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m41s)
00:07:41

[use the cheapest one here 40 cents an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m43s)
00:07:43

[hour you can pick how much draw it you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m45s)
00:07:45

[want and note that you pay for a month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[of storage as soon as you start the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m54s)
00:07:54

[machine up alright so don't start and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m56s)
00:07:56

[stop lots of machines because each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m58s)
00:07:58

[you pay for that month of storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[I think the 250 gig $7 a month option is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m01s)
00:08:01

[pretty good but you only need 50 gig so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m05s)
00:08:05

[if you're trying to minimize the price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[you can go there the only other thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m08s)
00:08:08

[you need to do is turn on public IP so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m12s)
00:08:12

[that we can actually log into this and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m16s)
00:08:16

[we can turn off auto snapshot to save](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m17s)
00:08:17

[the money or not having backups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[all right so if you then click on create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[your paper space about a minute later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[you will find that your machine will pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m32s)
00:08:32

[up here is my Ubuntu 1604 machine if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m37s)
00:08:37

[check your email you will find that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m42s)
00:08:42

[have emailed you a password so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m46s)
00:08:46

[copy that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m49s)
00:08:49

[and you can go to your machine and enter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[your password now to paste the password](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m54s)
00:08:54

[you would press ctrl shift V or on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m56s)
00:08:56

[against Apple shift V so it's slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m00s)
00:09:00

[different to normal pasting or of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m04s)
00:09:04

[you can just type it in and here we are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m06s)
00:09:06

[now we can make a little bit more room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[here by clicking on those little arrows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m13s)
00:09:13

[there can zoom in a little bit and so as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m15s)
00:09:15

[you can see we've got like a terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m18s)
00:09:18

[that's sitting inside our browser it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m20s)
00:09:20

[just kind of quite a handy way to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m24s)
00:09:24

[so now we need to configure this further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m26s)
00:09:26

[course and so the way you can figure it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m28s)
00:09:28

[for the course is you type curl HTTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m31s)
00:09:31

[colon slash slash files dot fast ai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[slash setup slash paper space type -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m41s)
00:09:41

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[and so that's then going to run a script](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m50s)
00:09:50

[which is going to set up all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[crudo drivers special Python Reaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m55s)
00:09:55

[Python distribution we use called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[anaconda all of the libraries or other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m03s)
00:10:03

[courses and the data we use for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m05s)
00:10:05

[first part of the course ok so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m09s)
00:10:09

[takes an hour or so and when it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m11s)
00:10:11

[finished running you'll need to reboot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m14s)
00:10:14

[your computer so to reboot not your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m16s)
00:10:16

[computer but your pages paste computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m19s)

[and so to do that you can just click on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m21s)
00:10:21

[this little circular restart machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m23s)
00:10:23

[button ok and when it comes back up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m25s)

[three directory that's where your python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m34s)
00:10:34

[is you've got a data directory which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m36s)
00:10:36

[contains the data for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m40s)
00:10:40

[the first part of this course first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m41s)
00:10:41

[lesson which is their dogs and cats and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m43s)
00:10:43

[you've got a fast AI directory and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m45s)
00:10:45

[contains everything for this course so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m49s)
00:10:49

[what you should do is CD fast AI and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m53s)
00:10:53

[from time to time you should go get Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m58s)
00:10:58

[and that will just make sure that all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m00s)

[also from time to time you might want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m06s)
00:11:06

[just check that your Python libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m09s)
00:11:09

[are up-to-date and so you can type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m10s)
00:11:10

[Condor and update to do that alright so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m11s)

[make sure that you've CD into fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m17s)
00:11:17

[and then you can type Jupiter notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m19s)
00:11:19

[all right there it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m26s)
00:11:26

[so we now have a Jupiter notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m28s)
00:11:28

[servant running and we want to connect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m30s)
00:11:30

[to that and so you can see here it says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[copy paste this URL into your browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m34s)

[and paste it but you need to change this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m49s)
00:11:49

[local host to be the paper space IP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m52s)
00:11:52

[address so if you click on the little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m55s)
00:11:55

[arrows to go smaller you can see the IP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m57s)
00:11:57

[addresses here so I'll just copy that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m00s)
00:12:00

[and paste it where it used to say local](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m03s)
00:12:03

[host okay so it's now HTTP and then my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m08s)
00:12:08

[IP and then everything else a copied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m10s)
00:12:10

[before and so there it is so this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[faster I get repo and our courses are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m17s)

00:12:45

[putting additional videos and links to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m47s)
00:12:47

[information about how to set up other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m49s)
00:12:49

[you know good Jupiter notebook providers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m51s)
00:12:51

[as well so to run a cell in Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m54s)
00:12:54

[notebook you select the cell and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m01s)
00:13:01

[hold down shift and press Enter or if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m03s)
00:13:03

[you've got the tool bar showing you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m07s)
00:13:07

[just click on the little Run button so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m09s)
00:13:09

[you'll notice that some cells contain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m12s)
00:13:12

[code and some contain text and some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m14s)
00:13:14

[contain pictures and some contain videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m18s)
00:13:18

[so this environment basically has you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m20s)
00:13:20

[know it's a it's a way that we can give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m24s)
00:13:24

[you access to and a way to run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[experiments and to kind of tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m29s)
00:13:29

[what's going on so pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m31s)
00:13:31

[this is why it's like a super popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m34s)
00:13:34

[tool in data science a data science is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m36s)
00:13:36

[kind of all about running experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m39s)
00:13:39

[really so let's go ahead and click run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m41s)
00:13:41

[and you'll see that cell turn into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m46s)
00:13:46

[star the one turn into a star for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m49s)
00:13:49

[moment and then it finished running okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m50s)
00:13:50

[so let's try the next one this time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m53s)
00:13:53

[instead of using the toolbar I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m55s)
00:13:55

[to hold down shift and press ENTER and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m56s)
00:13:56

[you can see again it turn into a star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m59s)
00:13:59

[and then it said to so if I hold down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m01s)
00:14:01

[shift and keep pressing enter it just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m03s)
00:14:03

[keeps running each so right so I can put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m05s)
00:14:05

[anything I like for example one plus one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m08s)
00:14:08

[is two so what we're going to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m10s)
00:14:10

[we're going to yes Rachel this is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m16s)
00:14:16

[side note but I wanted to point out that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m20s)
00:14:20

[we're using Python 3 here yes thank you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m22s)
00:14:22

[pythons are still using Python - mmhmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m25s)
00:14:25

[yeah um and it is important to switch to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m29s)
00:14:29

[Python 3 you know now well for Class A I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m32s)
00:14:32

[you require it but you know increasingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m36s)
00:14:36

[a lot of libraries are removing support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m39s)
00:14:39

[for Python - thanks Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m42s)
00:14:42

[now it mentions here that you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[download the data set for this lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m50s)
00:14:50

[from this location if you're using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m52s)
00:14:52

[crystal or the paper space script that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[we just used to set up that this will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m00s)
00:15:00

[already be and made available for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m02s)
00:15:02

[okay if you're not you'll need to W get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m03s)
00:15:03

[it as now Kressel is quite a bit slower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[than paper space and also it there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m11s)
00:15:11

[some particular things it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m15s)
00:15:15

[support that we really need and so there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[are a couple of extra steps if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m19s)
00:15:19

[using cresol you have to run two more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m21s)
00:15:21

[cells right so you can see these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m23s)
00:15:23

[commented out there quite hashes at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m25s)
00:15:25

[start so if you remove the hashes from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m27s)
00:15:27

[these and run these two additional cells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m29s)
00:15:29

[that just runs the stuff that the stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m31s)
00:15:31

[that you only need for crystal I'm using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m34s)
00:15:34

[paper space so I'm not going to run it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m35s)
00:15:35

[ok so inside our data so we set up this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m38s)
00:15:38

[path to data slash dogs cats that's pre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[set up for you and so inside there you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m48s)
00:15:48

[can see here I can use an exclamation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m51s)
00:15:51

[mark to basically say I don't want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m52s)
00:15:52

[run Python but I want to run bash right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m57s)
00:15:57

[I want to run shell so this runs a bash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[command and the bit inside the curly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m02s)
00:16:02

[brackets actually refers however to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m04s)
00:16:04

[python variable so inserts that python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m07s)
00:16:07

[variable into the batch command so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[here's the contents of our folder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m11s)
00:16:11

[there's a training set and a validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m13s)
00:16:13

[set if you're not familiar with the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m16s)
00:16:16

[of training sets and validation sets it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m19s)
00:16:19

[would be a very good idea to check out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m22s)
00:16:22

[our practical machine learning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m23s)
00:16:23

[which tells you a lot about this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m26s)
00:16:26

[stuff if like yeah the basics of how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m29s)
00:16:29

[setup and run machine learning projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m32s)
00:16:32

[more generally would you recommend that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m34s)
00:16:34

[people take that course before this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m37s)
00:16:37

[actually a lot of students who would you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m40s)
00:16:40

[know as they went through these as said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m43s)
00:16:43

[they'll they've liked doing them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m45s)
00:16:45

[together so you can kind of check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m46s)
00:16:46

[and see the machine learning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m49s)
00:16:49

[yeah they cover with some similar stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m55s)
00:16:55

[but all in different directions so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m57s)
00:16:57

[people have done both seen you know say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m59s)
00:16:59

[they find it they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m01s)
00:17:01

[they each support each other I wouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m02s)
00:17:02

[say it's a prerequisite but you know if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[I do if I say something like hey this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m07s)
00:17:07

[the training set and this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m09s)
00:17:09

[validation set and you're going I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m09s)
00:17:09

[know what that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m11s)
00:17:11

[at least Google but do a quick read you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m12s)
00:17:12

[know because we're assuming that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m14s)
00:17:14

[know the very basics of kind of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m16s)
00:17:16

[machine learning is and does to some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m20s)
00:17:20

[extent and I have a whole blog post on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m22s)
00:17:22

[this topic as well okay and we'll make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m25s)
00:17:25

[sure that you link to that from Pastor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m27s)
00:17:27

[day night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m29s)
00:17:29

[and as we just wanted to say in general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m29s)
00:17:29

[with fasting our philosophy is to kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m31s)
00:17:31

[of learn things on an as-needed basis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m35s)
00:17:35

[yeah exactly don't try and learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m37s)
00:17:37

[everything that you think you might need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m39s)
00:17:39

[first otherwise you'll never get around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m41s)
00:17:41

[elite learning the stuff you actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m42s)
00:17:42

[want to learn exactly that shows up in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m44s)
00:17:44

[deep learning I think particularly a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m46s)
00:17:46

[yes okay so in our validation folder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m48s)
00:17:48

[there's a cat's folder and a dog's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m53s)
00:17:53

[folder and then inside the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m55s)
00:17:55

[cats folder is a whole bunch of JPEGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m57s)
00:17:57

[the reason that it's set up like this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m00s)
00:18:00

[that this is kind of the most common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m03s)
00:18:03

[standard approach for how image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m05s)
00:18:05

[classification datasets shared and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m08s)
00:18:08

[provided and the idea is that each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m10s)
00:18:10

[folder tells you the label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m12s)
00:18:12

[so there's each of these images is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m15s)
00:18:15

[labeled cats and each of the images and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m18s)
00:18:18

[the dogs folder is labelled dogs okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m21s)
00:18:21

[this is how chaos works as well for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m23s)
00:18:23

[example so this is a pretty standard way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m25s)
00:18:25

[to share image classification files so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[we can have a look so if you go plot dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m37s)
00:18:37

[a.m. show we can see an example of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m40s)
00:18:40

[first of the cats if you haven't seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m43s)
00:18:43

[this before this is a Python 3.6 format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m47s)
00:18:47

[string so you can google for that if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m51s)
00:18:51

[haven't seen it it's a very convenient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m53s)
00:18:53

[way to do string formatting and we use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m54s)
00:18:54

[it a lot so there's no cat but we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m56s)
00:18:56

[going to mainly be interested in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[underlying data that makes up that cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[so specifically it's an image whose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m05s)
00:19:05

[shape that is the dimensions of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m10s)
00:19:10

[array is 198 by 1/7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m12s)
00:19:12

[9x3 is it's a three dimensional array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m14s)
00:19:14

[plus a quarter rank three tensor and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m16s)
00:19:16

[here are the first four rows and four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m19s)
00:19:19

[columns of that image so as you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m21s)
00:19:21

[each of those cells has three items in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m26s)
00:19:26

[it and this is the red green and blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m32s)
00:19:32

[pixel values between naught and 255 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m35s)
00:19:35

[here's a little subset of what a picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[actually looks like inside your computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m40s)
00:19:40

[so that's that that's will be our idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m42s)
00:19:42

[is to take these kinds of numbers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m46s)
00:19:46

[use them to predict whether those kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[of numbers represent a cat or a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m50s)
00:19:50

[based on looking at lots of pictures of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m53s)
00:19:53

[cats and dogs so that's a pretty hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m56s)
00:19:56

[thing to do and at the point in time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m58s)
00:19:58

[when this this this data set actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m01s)
00:20:01

[comes from a caracal competition the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[dogs versus cats caracal competition and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m06s)
00:20:06

[when it was released in I think it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m08s)
00:20:08

[2012 the state of the art was 80%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m10s)
00:20:10

[accuracy so computers weren't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m13s)
00:20:13

[able to at all accurately recognize dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m16s)
00:20:16

[versus cats so let's go ahead and train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m19s)
00:20:19

[a model so here are the three lines of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[code necessary to train a model and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m32s)
00:20:32

[let's go ahead and run it so I'll click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m36s)
00:20:36

[on this on the cell I'll press shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m38s)
00:20:38

[enter and then we'll wait a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m39s)
00:20:39

[seconds for it to pop up and there it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m45s)
00:20:45

[goes okay and it's training and so I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m47s)
00:20:47

[asked it to do three epochs so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m52s)
00:20:52

[means it's going to look at every image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m53s)
00:20:53

[three times in total or look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m55s)
00:20:55

[entire set of images three times that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m57s)
00:20:57

[what we mean by an epoch and as we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m00s)
00:21:00

[it's going to print out the accuracy is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m02s)
00:21:02

[that's lasted for three numbers it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m07s)
00:21:07

[prints out on the validation set okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m09s)
00:21:09

[the first three numbers we'll talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m11s)
00:21:11

[later in short they're the value of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m13s)
00:21:13

[loss function which is in this case the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[cross-entropy loss for the training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m17s)
00:21:17

[and the validation set and then right at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m19s)
00:21:19

[the start here is the epoch number so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m21s)
00:21:21

[you can see it's getting about 90%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m24s)
00:21:24

[see and it took 17 seconds so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m28s)
00:21:28

[see we've come a long way since 2012 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m33s)
00:21:33

[in fact even in the competition this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m35s)
00:21:35

[actually would have won the caracal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m39s)
00:21:39

[competition of that time the best in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m42s)
00:21:42

[caracal competition was 98.9 and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m44s)
00:21:44

[getting about 99% so this play surprised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m46s)
00:21:46

[you that we're getting a you know Kaggle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m50s)

[winning as of 20 and of 2012 early 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m54s)
00:21:54

[kaggle winning image classifier in 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m59s)
00:21:59

[seconds that and three lines of code and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m02s)
00:22:02

[I think that's because like a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m08s)
00:22:08

[people assume that deep learning takes a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m10s)
00:22:10

[huge amount of time and lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[resources and lots of data and as you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m17s)
00:22:17

[learn in this course that in general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m19s)
00:22:19

[rule isn't true one of the ways we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m22s)
00:22:22

[made it much simpler is that this code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m25s)
00:22:25

[is written on top of a library we built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m28s)
00:22:28

[imaginatively called fast AI the faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m32s)
00:22:32

[a library is basically a library which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m35s)
00:22:35

[takes all of the best practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m38s)
00:22:38

[approaches that we can find and so each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m41s)
00:22:41

[time a paper comes out you know we that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m44s)
00:22:44

[looks interesting we test it out if it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m46s)
00:22:46

[works well for a variety of data sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m48s)
00:22:48

[and we can figure out how to tune it we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m50s)
00:22:50

[implement it in fast AI and so faster I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m52s)
00:22:52

[kind of curates all this stuff and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m54s)
00:22:54

[packages up for you and much of the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m56s)
00:22:56

[but most the time kind of automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m59s)
00:22:59

[figures out the best way to handle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m01s)
00:23:01

[things so the first day our library is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m03s)
00:23:03

[why we were able to do this in just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m05s)
00:23:05

[three lines of code and the reason that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m06s)
00:23:06

[we were able to make the faster I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m09s)
00:23:09

[library work so well is because it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m11s)
00:23:11

[interns it's on top of something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m13s)
00:23:13

[pi torch which is a really flexible deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m15s)
00:23:15

[learning and machine learning and GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m20s)
00:23:20

[computation library written by Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m23s)
00:23:23

[most people are more familiar with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m27s)
00:23:27

[tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m29s)
00:23:29

[than pi torch because google markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m30s)
00:23:30

[that pretty heavily but most of the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m33s)
00:23:33

[researchers I know nowadays at least the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m35s)
00:23:35

[ones that are at Google have switched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m37s)
00:23:37

[across to PI torch yes Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m39s)
00:23:39

[and we'll be covering some pie torts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m42s)
00:23:42

[later in the course yeah it's I mean one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m43s)
00:23:43

[of the things that hopefully you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m46s)
00:23:46

[really like about last AI is that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m49s)
00:23:49

[really flexible that you can use all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m52s)
00:23:52

[these kind of curated best practices as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m54s)
00:23:54

[much as little as you want and so really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m56s)
00:23:56

[easy to hook in at any point and write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m59s)
00:23:59

[your own data augmentation write your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m01s)
00:24:01

[own loss function write your own network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m04s)
00:24:04

[architecture whatever and so we'll do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m06s)
00:24:06

[all of those things in this course so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m08s)
00:24:08

[what does this model look like well what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m12s)
00:24:12

[we can do is we can take a look at so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m15s)
00:24:15

[what are the what is the validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m20s)
00:24:20

[dependent variable the Y look like and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m22s)
00:24:22

[it's just a bunch of zeros and ones okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m24s)
00:24:24

[so the zeros if we look at data dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m27s)
00:24:27

[classes the zeros represent cats the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[ones represent dogs you'll see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m31s)
00:24:31

[there's basically two objects I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m34s)
00:24:34

[working with one is an object called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m35s)
00:24:35

[data which contains the validation and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m36s)
00:24:36

[training data and another one is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m39s)
00:24:39

[object called learn which contains the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m41s)
00:24:41

[model right so anytime you want to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m43s)
00:24:43

[something out about the data we can look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m45s)
00:24:45

[inside data so we're going to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m47s)
00:24:47

[predictions through our validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m50s)
00:24:50

[and so to do that we can call learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m52s)
00:24:52

[predict and so you can see here the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m54s)
00:24:54

[first ten predictions and what it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m59s)
00:24:59

[giving you as a prediction for dog and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[prediction for cat now the way PI Torche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m04s)
00:25:04

[generally works and therefore fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m07s)
00:25:07

[also works is that most models return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m08s)
00:25:08

[the log of the predictions rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m11s)
00:25:11

[the probabilities themselves we'll learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m16s)
00:25:16

[why that is later in the course so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m18s)
00:25:18

[now recognize that to get your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m20s)
00:25:20

[probabilities you have to get e to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[power of you'll see here we're using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m25s)
00:25:25

[numpy NP is none play if you're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m28s)
00:25:28

[familiar with numpy that is one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m31s)
00:25:31

[things that we assume that you have some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m33s)
00:25:33

[familiarity with so be sure to check out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m35s)
00:25:35

[the material on cost I passed at AI to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m38s)
00:25:38

[learn the basics of number it's the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m40s)
00:25:40

[that - handles all of the fast numerical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m45s)
00:25:45

[programming array computation that kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m51s)
00:25:51

[of thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m54s)
00:25:54

[okay so we can get the probabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m55s)
00:25:55

[using that using MP dot X and there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m58s)
00:25:58

[few functions here that you can look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m03s)
00:26:03

[yourself if you're interested that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m04s)
00:26:04

[just some flooding functions that we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m05s)
00:26:05

[use and so we can now plot some random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m07s)
00:26:07

[correct images and so here are some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m12s)
00:26:12

[images that it's correct about okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m17s)
00:26:17

[so remember one is a dog so anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m20s)
00:26:20

[greater than 0.5 is dog and zero is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m23s)
00:26:23

[cat so this is what 10 to the negative 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m26s)
00:26:26

[obviously a cat here are some which are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m28s)
00:26:28

[incorrect alright so you can see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m32s)
00:26:32

[some of these which it thinks are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[incorrect obviously are just the you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m36s)
00:26:36

[know images that shouldn't be there at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m38s)
00:26:38

[all but clearly this one which it called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m40s)
00:26:40

[a a dog is not at all a dog so there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m43s)
00:26:43

[some obvious mistakes we can also take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m47s)
00:26:47

[look at which cats is it the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m52s)
00:26:52

[confident are cats which dogs are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m56s)
00:26:56

[most doglike the most confident dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m59s)
00:26:59

[perhaps more interestingly we can also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m03s)
00:27:03

[see which cats is that the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m05s)
00:27:05

[confident are actually dogs so which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m07s)
00:27:07

[ones it is it the most wrong about and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m09s)
00:27:09

[same thing for the ones the dog said it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m12s)
00:27:12

[really thinks of cats and again some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m15s)
00:27:15

[these are just pretty weird I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m18s)
00:27:18

[there is a dog in there yes Rachel I see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m20s)
00:27:20

[suit you want to see more about why you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m23s)
00:27:23

[would want to look at your data yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m25s)
00:27:25

[sure so yeah so finally I just mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m28s)
00:27:28

[the last one we've got here is to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m33s)
00:27:33

[which ones have the probability closest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[to 0.5 so these are the ones that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m37s)
00:27:37

[model knows it doesn't really know what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m39s)
00:27:39

[to do with and some of these it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m42s)
00:27:42

[surprising so yeah I mean this is kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m43s)
00:27:43

[of like always the first thing I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m48s)
00:27:48

[after I build a model is to try to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m51s)
00:27:51

[a way to like visualize what it's built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m54s)
00:27:54

[because if I want to make the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m57s)
00:27:57

[better then I need to take advantage of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m59s)
00:27:59

[the things that's doing well and fix the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m01s)
00:28:01

[things that's doing badly and so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m03s)
00:28:03

[case and off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m05s)
00:28:05

[this is the case I've learned something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m08s)
00:28:08

[about the data set itself which is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m10s)
00:28:10

[there are some things that are in here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[that probably shouldn't be but I've also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[like it's also clear that this model has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[room to improve like to me that's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m21s)
00:28:21

[obviously a dog but one thing I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m25s)
00:28:25

[suspicious about here is this image is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[very kind of fat and short and as we all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m31s)
00:28:31

[learn the way these algorithms work is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m38s)
00:28:38

[it kind of grabs a square piece at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m41s)
00:28:41

[time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m44s)
00:28:44

[so this rather makes me suspicious that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m45s)
00:28:45

[we're going to need to use something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m47s)
00:28:47

[called data augmentation that we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m48s)
00:28:48

[learn about learn about later to handle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m50s)
00:28:50

[this properly okay so that's it right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m52s)
00:28:52

[we've now built we've now built an image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m00s)
00:29:00

[classifier and something that you should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m05s)
00:29:05

[try now is to grab some data yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m07s)
00:29:07

[some pictures of two or more different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m13s)
00:29:13

[types of thing put them in different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m17s)
00:29:17

[folders and run the same three lines of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m19s)
00:29:19

[code on them okay and you'll find that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m22s)
00:29:22

[it will work for that as well as long as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m27s)
00:29:27

[that they are pictures of things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m31s)
00:29:31

[the kinds of things that people normally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m33s)
00:29:33

[take photos of right so if their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m35s)
00:29:35

[microscope microscope pictures or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m38s)
00:29:38

[pathology pictures or CT scans or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m40s)
00:29:40

[something this won't work very well as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m44s)
00:29:44

[well learn about later there are some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m46s)
00:29:46

[other things we didn't need to do to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m47s)
00:29:47

[make that work but for things that look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m49s)
00:29:49

[like normal photos these you can run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m51s)
00:29:51

[exactly the same three lines of code and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m56s)
00:29:56

[just point your path variable somewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m58s)
00:29:58

[else to get your own image classifier so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m02s)
00:30:02

[for example one student took those three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m05s)
00:30:05

[lines of code downloaded for Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[Images ten examples of pictures of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m12s)
00:30:12

[people playing cricket ten examples of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[people playing baseball and build a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[classifier of those images which was new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m19s)
00:30:19

[perfectly correct the same student](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m22s)
00:30:22

[actually also tried downloading seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m25s)
00:30:25

[pictures of Canadian currency seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m28s)
00:30:28

[pictures of American currency and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m32s)
00:30:32

[in that case the model was a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m34s)
00:30:34

[percent accurate so you can just go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m37s)
00:30:37

[Google Images if you like and download a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m39s)
00:30:39

[few things of a few different classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[and see see what works and tell us on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

[the forum both your successes and your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m45s)
00:30:45

[failures so what we just did was to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m47s)
00:30:47

[train a neural network but we didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m55s)
00:30:55

[first of all tell you what a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m58s)
00:30:58

[network is or what training means or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m59s)
00:30:59

[anything why is that well this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m02s)
00:31:02

[start of our top-down approach to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m07s)
00:31:07

[learning and basically the idea is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m10s)
00:31:10

[unlike the way math and technical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m13s)
00:31:13

[subjects I usually talk where you learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m16s)
00:31:16

[every little element piece by piece and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m18s)
00:31:18

[you don't actually get to put them all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m21s)
00:31:21

[together and build your own image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m23s)
00:31:23

[classifier until third year of graduate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m25s)
00:31:25

[school our approach is to say from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m28s)
00:31:28

[start hey let's show you how to train an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m31s)
00:31:31

[image classifier and you can start doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m34s)
00:31:34

[stuff and then gradually we dig deeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m36s)
00:31:36

[and deeper and deeper and so the idea is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m39s)
00:31:39

[that throughout the course you're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m44s)
00:31:44

[to see like new problems that we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m47s)
00:31:47

[solve so for example in the next lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m50s)
00:31:50

[we'll look at well what if we're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m53s)
00:31:53

[looking at normal kinds of photos but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m57s)
00:31:57

[we're looking at satellite images and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m59s)
00:31:59

[we'll see why it is that this approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m01s)
00:32:01

[that we're learning today doesn't quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m03s)
00:32:03

[work as well and what things do we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m05s)
00:32:05

[to change and so we'll learn enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m07s)
00:32:07

[about the theory to understand why that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m09s)
00:32:09

[happens and then we'll learn about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m11s)
00:32:11

[libraries and how we can change change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m13s)
00:32:13

[things with the libraries to make that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m15s)
00:32:15

[work better and so during the course we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m17s)
00:32:17

[are gradually going to learn to solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m21s)
00:32:21

[more and more problems as we do so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m23s)
00:32:23

[all need to learn more and more parts of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m26s)
00:32:26

[the library more and more bits of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m28s)
00:32:28

[theory until by the end we're actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m30s)
00:32:30

[going to learn how to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[world plus neural net architecture from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m35s)
00:32:35

[scratch and our own training loop from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m39s)
00:32:39

[scratch and so were actually built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m41s)
00:32:41

[everything ourselves so that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m43s)
00:32:43

[general approach yes Rachel and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m46s)
00:32:46

[sometimes also call this the whole game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m50s)
00:32:50

[which is inspired by harvard professor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m52s)
00:32:52

[david perkins yeah and so the idea with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m55s)
00:32:55

[the whole game is like this is more like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m58s)
00:32:58

[how you would learn baseball or music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m00s)
00:33:00

[with baseball you would get taken to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m02s)
00:33:02

[ball game you would learn what baseball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m04s)
00:33:04

[is you would start playing it and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m06s)
00:33:06

[would only be years later that you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m10s)
00:33:10

[learn about the physics of how curveball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m12s)
00:33:12

[works for example well with music we put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m14s)
00:33:14

[a instrument in your hand and you start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m17s)
00:33:17

[banging the drum or hitting the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m20s)
00:33:20

[xylophone and it's not until years later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m21s)
00:33:21

[that you learn about the circle of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m23s)
00:33:23

[fifths and understand how to construct a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m25s)
00:33:25

[cadence example so yeah so that this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m27s)
00:33:27

[kind of the approach we're using it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m32s)
00:33:32

[very inspired by David Perkins and other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m33s)
00:33:33

[writers of Education so what that does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m36s)
00:33:36

[mean is to take advantage of this as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m40s)
00:33:40

[peel back the layers we want you to keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m42s)
00:33:42

[like looking under the hood yourself as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m45s)
00:33:45

[well like experiment a lot now because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m47s)
00:33:47

[this is a very code driven approach so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m50s)
00:33:50

[here's basically what happens right we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m53s)
00:33:53

[start out looking today at convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m55s)
00:33:55

[neural networks for images and then in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m58s)
00:33:58

[couple of lessons we'll start to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m01s)
00:34:01

[how to use neural nets to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m03s)
00:34:03

[structured data and then look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m04s)
00:34:04

[language data and then look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m06s)
00:34:06

[recommendation system data and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m09s)
00:34:09

[kind of then take all of those depths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[and we go backwards through them in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m15s)
00:34:15

[reverse order so now you know by the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m17s)
00:34:17

[of that fourth piece you will know by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m19s)
00:34:19

[the end of lesson four how to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m24s)
00:34:24

[world-class image classifier a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m26s)
00:34:26

[world-class structured data analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m28s)
00:34:28

[program world-class language classifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m31s)
00:34:31

[broad class recommendation system and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m34s)
00:34:34

[then we're going to go back over all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m37s)
00:34:37

[them again and learn in depth about like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m38s)
00:34:38

[well what exactly did it do and how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m41s)
00:34:41

[do work and how do we change things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m42s)
00:34:42

[around and use it in different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m45s)
00:34:45

[situations for for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m46s)
00:34:46

[recommendation systems structured data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m48s)
00:34:48

[images and then finally back to language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m51s)
00:34:51

[so that's how it's going to work so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m54s)
00:34:54

[that kind of means is that most students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m57s)
00:34:57

[find that they tend to watch the videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m00s)
00:35:00

[two or three times but not like watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m02s)
00:35:02

[lesson one two or three times and listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m07s)
00:35:07

[to two or three times in verse and three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m09s)
00:35:09

[three times but like they do the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m10s)
00:35:10

[thing into end lessons one through seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m12s)
00:35:12

[and then go back and start lesson one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m14s)
00:35:14

[again that's an approach which a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m17s)
00:35:17

[people find when they want to go back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m20s)
00:35:20

[and understand all the details enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m22s)
00:35:22

[that can work pretty well so I would say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m24s)
00:35:24

[you know aim to get through to the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m26s)
00:35:26

[of lesson seven you know as as quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m29s)
00:35:29

[as you can rather than aiming to fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m34s)
00:35:34

[understand every detail from this data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m37s)
00:35:37

[so basically the plan is that in today's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m41s)
00:35:41

[lesson you'll learn in as few lines of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m45s)
00:35:45

[code as possible with as few details as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m49s)
00:35:49

[possible how do you actually build an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m51s)
00:35:51

[image classifier with deep learning to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m53s)
00:35:53

[do this to in this case say hey here are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m55s)
00:35:55

[some pictures of dogs as opposed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m58s)
00:35:58

[pictures of cats then we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m00s)
00:36:00

[learn how to look at different kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m04s)
00:36:04

[images and particularly we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m07s)
00:36:07

[look at images of from satellites and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m09s)
00:36:09

[we're going to say for a satellite image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m12s)
00:36:12

[what kinds of things might you be seeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m13s)
00:36:13

[in that image and there could be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m17s)
00:36:17

[multiple things that we're looking at so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m18s)
00:36:18

[a multi-label classification problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m20s)
00:36:20

[from there we'll move to something which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m22s)
00:36:22

[is perhaps the most widely applicable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m25s)
00:36:25

[for the most people which is looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m28s)
00:36:28

[what we call structured data so data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m30s)
00:36:30

[about data that kind of comes from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m33s)
00:36:33

[databases or spreadsheets so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m37s)
00:36:37

[to specifically look at this data set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m40s)
00:36:40

[predicting sales the number of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m42s)
00:36:42

[that are sold at different stores on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m44s)
00:36:44

[different dates based on different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m47s)
00:36:47

[holidays and and so on and so forth and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m49s)
00:36:49

[so we're going to be doing its sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m52s)
00:36:52

[forecasting exercise after that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m53s)
00:36:53

[going to look at language and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m57s)
00:36:57

[going to figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m59s)
00:36:59

[what this person thinks about the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m01s)
00:37:01

[is on be given and will be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m04s)
00:37:04

[figure out how to create just like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m06s)
00:37:06

[create image classifiers for any kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m08s)
00:37:08

[image will learn to create in NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m10s)
00:37:10

[classifiers to classify any kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m12s)
00:37:12

[language in lots of different ways then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m15s)
00:37:15

[we'll look at something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m19s)
00:37:19

[collaborative filtering which is used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m20s)
00:37:20

[mainly for recommendation systems we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m22s)
00:37:22

[going to be looking at this data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m24s)
00:37:24

[that showed four different people for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[different movies what rating did they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m27s)
00:37:27

[give it and here are some of the movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m29s)
00:37:29

[and so this is maybe an easier way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m31s)
00:37:31

[think about it is there are lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m34s)
00:37:34

[different users and lots of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m36s)
00:37:36

[movies and then for each one we can look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m38s)
00:37:38

[up for each user how much they liked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m40s)
00:37:40

[that movie and the goal will be of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m42s)
00:37:42

[course to predict for user movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m44s)
00:37:44

[combinations we haven't seen before are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m47s)
00:37:47

[they likely to enjoy that movie or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m49s)
00:37:49

[and that's the really common approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m51s)
00:37:51

[used for like deciding what stuff to put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m54s)
00:37:54

[on your homepage when somebody's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m57s)
00:37:57

[visiting you know what book might they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m59s)
00:37:59

[want to read or what film might they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m00s)
00:38:00

[want to see or so forth from there we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m02s)
00:38:02

[could have then dig back into language a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[bit more and we're going to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m09s)
00:38:09

[actually we're gonna look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m11s)
00:38:11

[writings of Nietzsche the philosopher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m13s)
00:38:13

[and learn how to create our own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m15s)
00:38:15

[Nietzsche philosophy from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m17s)
00:38:17

[character by character so this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m19s)
00:38:19

[perhaps that every life values a blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m22s)
00:38:22

[of intercourse when it senses there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m24s)
00:38:24

[unscrupulous who's very right sense to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[impulse love is not actually Nietzsche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m28s)
00:38:28

[that's actually like some character by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m31s)
00:38:31

[character generated text that we built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m34s)
00:38:34

[with this recurrent neural network and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m37s)
00:38:37

[then finally we're going to loop all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m41s)
00:38:41

[way back to computer vision again we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m43s)
00:38:43

[going to learn how not just to recognize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m45s)
00:38:45

[cats from dogs how to actually find like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m47s)
00:38:47

[where the cat is with this kind of hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m49s)
00:38:49

[map and we're also going to learn how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m51s)
00:38:51

[write our own architectures from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m54s)
00:38:54

[so this is an example of a resonate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m56s)
00:38:56

[which is the kind of network that we are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m59s)
00:38:59

[using in today's lesson for computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m02s)
00:39:02

[vision and so we'll actually end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m04s)
00:39:04

[building the network and the training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m06s)
00:39:06

[loop from scratch and so they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m08s)
00:39:08

[basically the the steps that we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m10s)
00:39:10

[to be taking from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m12s)
00:39:12

[and at each step we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m14s)
00:39:14

[getting into increasing amounts of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m15s)

00:39:20

[that from our students of past courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m25s)
00:39:25

[about what they've found and one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m27s)

00:39:34

[much time on theory and research and not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m37s)

[C and C++ learn parallel programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m34s)
00:40:34

[learn ml algorithms implement them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m38s)
00:40:38

[yourself using plain C and finally start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m40s)
00:40:40

[doing ml so we would say if you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m43s)
00:40:43

[become an effective practitioner do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[exactly the opposite of of this yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m47s)
00:40:47

[Rachel yeah I'm just highlighting that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m51s)
00:40:51

[this is we think this is bad advice and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m53s)
00:40:53

[this can be very discouraging for a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m56s)
00:40:56

[of people to come across this yeah yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m58s)
00:40:58

[it's it's it's it's you know we now have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m00s)
00:41:00

[thousands and more tens of thousands of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m03s)
00:41:03

[people that have done this course and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m04s)
00:41:04

[have lots and lots of examples of people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m06s)
00:41:06

[who are now running research labs or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m11s)
00:41:11

[Google brain residence or you know have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m14s)
00:41:14

[created patents based on deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m18s)
00:41:18

[and so forth who have done it by doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m20s)
00:41:20

[this course so the top-down approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m22s)
00:41:22

[works super well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m24s)
00:41:24

[now one thing to mention is like we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m27s)
00:41:27

[we've now already learned how you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m30s)
00:41:30

[actually train a world-class image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m32s)
00:41:32

[classifier in 17 seconds I should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m34s)
00:41:34

[mention by the way the first time you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m38s)
00:41:38

[run that code there are two things it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m40s)
00:41:40

[has to do that take more than 17 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m43s)
00:41:43

[one is that it downloads a pre trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m45s)
00:41:45

[model from the internet so you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m48s)
00:41:48

[the first time you run it it'll say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m50s)
00:41:50

[downloading model so that takes a minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[or two also the first time you run it it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m55s)
00:41:55

[pre computes and caches some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m58s)
00:41:58

[intermediate information that it needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m01s)
00:42:01

[and that takes about a minute and a half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m02s)
00:42:02

[as well so if the first time you run it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m05s)
00:42:05

[it takes three or four minutes to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m08s)
00:42:08

[download and pre compute stuff that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m11s)
00:42:11

[normal if you run it again you should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m13s)
00:42:13

[find it takes 20 seconds or so so image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m15s)
00:42:15

[classifiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m20s)
00:42:20

[you know you may not feel like you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m21s)
00:42:21

[to recognize cats versus dogs very often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m24s)
00:42:24

[on a computer you can probably do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m27s)
00:42:27

[yourself pretty well but what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[interestingly interesting is that these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m31s)
00:42:31

[image classification algorithms are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[really useful for lots and lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m35s)
00:42:35

[things for example alphago which became](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m37s)
00:42:37

[which beat the go world champion the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m43s)
00:42:43

[it worked was to use something at its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m46s)
00:42:46

[heart that looked almost exactly like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m50s)
00:42:50

[our dogs vs. cats image classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m53s)
00:42:53

[algorithm it looked at thousands and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m55s)
00:42:55

[thousands of go boards and at for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m58s)
00:42:58

[one there was a label saying whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[that go board ended up being the winning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m04s)
00:43:04

[or the losing player and so it learnt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m06s)
00:43:06

[basically an image classification that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[was able to look at a go board and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m13s)
00:43:13

[figure out whether it was a good group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m15s)
00:43:15

[or a bad code board and that's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m16s)
00:43:16

[the key most important step in playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m19s)
00:43:19

[Gowell is to know which which move is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[better another example is one of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m25s)
00:43:25

[earlier students who actually got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m29s)
00:43:29

[couple of patterns for this work looked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m33s)
00:43:33

[at anti-fraud he had lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m36s)
00:43:36

[all of his customers mouths movements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m40s)
00:43:40

[because they they provided kind of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m42s)
00:43:42

[user tracking software to help avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[fraud and so he took the the mouse paths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m48s)
00:43:48

[basically of the users on his customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m52s)
00:43:52

[websites turn them into pictures of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m56s)
00:43:56

[where their mouse moved and how quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m59s)
00:43:59

[it moved and then built a image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m01s)
00:44:01

[classifier that took those images as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m04s)
00:44:04

[input and as output it was was that a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m07s)
00:44:07

[fraudulent transaction or not and turned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[out to go you know really great results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[for his company so image classifiers are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m15s)
00:44:15

[like much more flexible than you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m19s)
00:44:19

[imagine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m22s)
00:44:22

[so so this is how you know some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m23s)
00:44:23

[ways you can use deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m28s)
00:44:28

[specifically for image recognition and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m29s)
00:44:29

[it's worth understanding that deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m33s)
00:44:33

[learning is not you know just a word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m37s)
00:44:37

[that means the same thing as machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m41s)
00:44:41

[learning right like what is it that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m42s)
00:44:42

[we're actually doing here when we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m44s)
00:44:44

[doing deep learning instead deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m45s)
00:44:45

[learning is a kind of machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m48s)
00:44:48

[so machine learning was invented by this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m50s)
00:44:50

[guy Arthur Samuels who was pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m53s)
00:44:53

[amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[in the late 50s he got this IBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[mainframe to play checkers better than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m58s)
00:44:58

[he can and the way he did it was he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m01s)
00:45:01

[invented machine learning he got the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m04s)
00:45:04

[mainframe to play against itself lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m07s)
00:45:07

[times and figure out which kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m10s)
00:45:10

[things led to victories and which kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m13s)
00:45:13

[of things didn't and use that to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m14s)
00:45:14

[almost write its own program and Arthur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m18s)
00:45:18

[Arthur Samuels actually said in 1962](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m20s)
00:45:20

[that he thought that one day the vast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m23s)
00:45:23

[majority of computer software would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m25s)
00:45:25

[written using this machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m27s)
00:45:27

[approach rather than written by hand by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m30s)
00:45:30

[writing the loops and so forth by hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m32s)
00:45:32

[so I guess that hasn't happened yet but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m34s)
00:45:34

[it seems to be in the process of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m38s)
00:45:38

[happening I think one of the reasons it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m40s)
00:45:40

[didn't happen for a long time is because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m43s)
00:45:43

[traditional machine learning actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m45s)
00:45:45

[was very difficult and very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m47s)
00:45:47

[knowledge and time intensive so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m51s)
00:45:51

[example here's something called the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m54s)
00:45:54

[computational pathologist or C path from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m55s)

00:45:59

[when he was at Stanford he's now moved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m01s)
00:46:01

[on to somewhere on the East Coast no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m04s)
00:46:04

[Harvard I think and what he did was he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m07s)
00:46:07

[took these pathology slides of breast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m11s)
00:46:11

[cancer biopsies right and he worked with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m13s)
00:46:13

[lots of pathologists to come up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m18s)
00:46:18

[ideas about what kinds of patterns or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m21s)
00:46:21

[features might be associated with so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m24s)
00:46:24

[long-term survival versus versus dying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m27s)
00:46:27

[quickly basically and so he came up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m31s)
00:46:31

[these ideas like well they came up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m34s)
00:46:34

[these ideas like relationship between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m36s)
00:46:36

[epithelial nuclear neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m37s)

[relationship between epithelial and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m39s)
00:46:39

[stromal objects and so forth and so they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m41s)
00:46:41

[came up with all of these ideas of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m44s)
00:46:44

[features these are just a few of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m45s)
00:46:45

[hundreds that they thought of and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m47s)
00:46:47

[lots of smart computer programmers wrote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[specialist algorithms to to calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m53s)
00:46:53

[all these different features and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m56s)
00:46:56

[those those features were passed into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m58s)
00:46:58

[logistic regression to predict survival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m01s)
00:47:01

[and it ended up working very well and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m04s)
00:47:04

[ended up that the survival predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m07s)
00:47:07

[were more accurate than pathologists own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m10s)

00:47:13

[learning can work really well but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m16s)

[point here is that this was a an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m18s)
00:47:18

[approach that took lots of domain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m21s)
00:47:21

[experts and computer experts many years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[of work to actually to build this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m27s)
00:47:27

[right so we really want something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m30s)
00:47:30

[something better and so specifically I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m37s)
00:47:37

[going to show you something which rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m41s)
00:47:41

[than being a very specific function with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m43s)
00:47:43

[all this very domain-specific feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m47s)
00:47:47

[engineering we're going to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m51s)
00:47:51

[create an infinitely flexible function a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m53s)
00:47:53

[function that could solve any problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m56s)
00:47:56

[right it would solve any problem if only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m58s)
00:47:58

[you set the parameters of that function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m01s)
00:48:01

[correctly and so then we need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m03s)
00:48:03

[or purpose way of setting the parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[of that function and we would need that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m07s)
00:48:07

[to be fast and scalable right now if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m10s)
00:48:10

[had something that had these three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m12s)
00:48:12

[things then you wouldn't need to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m14s)
00:48:14

[incredibly time and domain knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m16s)
00:48:16

[intensive approach anymore instead we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m18s)
00:48:18

[can learn all of those things with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m21s)
00:48:21

[with this algorithm so as you might have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m24s)
00:48:24

[guessed the algorithm in question which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m28s)
00:48:28

[has these three properties is called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m31s)
00:48:31

[deep learning or it's not an algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m33s)
00:48:33

[then maybe we will call it a class of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m36s)
00:48:36

[algorithms let's look at each of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m38s)
00:48:38

[three things in turn so the underlying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m41s)
00:48:41

[function that deep learning uses is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m44s)
00:48:44

[something called the neural network now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m47s)
00:48:47

[the neural network we're going to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m50s)
00:48:50

[all about it and implemented ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m53s)
00:48:53

[from scratch later on in the course but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m54s)
00:48:54

[for now all you need to know about it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m57s)
00:48:57

[that it consists of a number of simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m59s)
00:48:59

[linear layers interspersed with a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m02s)
00:49:02

[of simple nonlinear layers and when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m05s)
00:49:05

[in dispersed these layers in this way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m10s)
00:49:10

[you get something called the universal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m12s)
00:49:12

[approximation theorem and the universal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m15s)
00:49:15

[approximation theorem says that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m18s)
00:49:18

[kind of function can solve any given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m20s)
00:49:20

[problem to arbitrarily close accuracy as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m24s)
00:49:24

[long as you add enough parameters so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m28s)
00:49:28

[it's actually provably shown to be an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m32s)
00:49:32

[infinitely flexible function okay so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m35s)
00:49:35

[we need some way to fit the parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m39s)
00:49:39

[so that this infinitely flexible neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m41s)
00:49:41

[network solves some specific problem and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m43s)
00:49:43

[so the way we do that is using a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m46s)
00:49:46

[technique that probably most of you will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m49s)
00:49:49

[have come across before at some stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m51s)
00:49:51

[called gradient descent and with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[gradient descent we basically say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[well for the different parameters we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m58s)
00:49:58

[have how how good are they at solving my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m59s)
00:49:59

[problem and let's figure out a slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[better set of parameters and a slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m06s)
00:50:06

[better set of parameters and j6v follow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m09s)
00:50:09

[down the the surface of the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m11s)
00:50:11

[function downwards it's kind of like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m14s)
00:50:14

[marble going down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m15s)
00:50:15

[find the minimum and as you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m18s)
00:50:18

[depending on where you start you end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[in different places these things a court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[local minima now interestingly it turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m27s)
00:50:27

[out that for neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m31s)
00:50:31

[particularly in particular there aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[actually multiple different local minima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m36s)
00:50:36

[there's basically just there's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m41s)
00:50:41

[just one right or think of it another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m44s)
00:50:44

[way there are different parts of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m46s)
00:50:46

[space which are all equally good so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[gradient descent therefore turns out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m53s)
00:50:53

[be actually an excellent way to solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m56s)
00:50:56

[this problem of fitting parameters to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m59s)
00:50:59

[neural networks the problem is though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m02s)
00:51:02

[that we need to do it in a reasonable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m06s)
00:51:06

[amount of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[and it's really only thanks to GPUs that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m09s)
00:51:09

[that's become possible so GPUs this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m12s)
00:51:12

[shows over the last few years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m16s)
00:51:16

[how many gigaflops per second can you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m19s)
00:51:19

[get out of a GPU that's the red and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m22s)
00:51:22

[green versus a CPU that's the blue right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m26s)
00:51:26

[and this is on a log scale so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m29s)
00:51:29

[see that generally speaking the GPUs are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m32s)
00:51:32

[about 10 times faster than the CPUs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m36s)
00:51:36

[what's really interesting is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m42s)
00:51:42

[nowadays not only is the Titan X about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m44s)
00:51:44

[10 times faster than the e5 to $6.99 CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m48s)
00:51:48

[but the Titan X well actually better one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m51s)
00:51:51

[to look at would be the GTX 1080i GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m56s)
00:51:56

[costs about 700 bucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m59s)
00:51:59

[whereas the CPU which is 10 times slower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m01s)
00:52:01

[costs over $4,000 so GPUs turn out to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m04s)
00:52:04

[able to solve these neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m10s)
00:52:10

[parameter fitting problems incredibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m14s)
00:52:14

[quickly and also incredibly cheaply so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m17s)
00:52:17

[they've been absolutely key in bringing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m20s)
00:52:20

[these three pieces together then there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m24s)
00:52:24

[one more piece which is I mentioned that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m28s)
00:52:28

[these neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m31s)
00:52:31

[so you can intersperse multiple sets of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m32s)
00:52:32

[linear and then nonlinear layers in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m34s)
00:52:34

[particular example that's drawn here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m40s)
00:52:40

[there's actually only one what we call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m42s)
00:52:42

[hidden layer one layer in the middle and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m44s)
00:52:44

[something that we learned in the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m46s)
00:52:46

[few years is that these kinds of neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m48s)
00:52:48

[networks although they do support the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m51s)
00:52:51

[universal approximation theorem they can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m53s)
00:52:53

[solve any given problem arbitrarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m55s)
00:52:55

[closely they require an exponentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m58s)
00:52:58

[increasing number of parameters to do so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m02s)
00:53:02

[so they don't actually solve the fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m04s)
00:53:04

[and scalable for even reasonable size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m07s)
00:53:07

[problems but we've since discovered that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m09s)
00:53:09

[if you create add multiple hidden layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[then you get super linear scaling so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m16s)
00:53:16

[can add a few more hidden layers to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m20s)
00:53:20

[multiplicatively more accuracy 2ma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[duplicative lis more complex problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m27s)
00:53:27

[and that is where it becomes called deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m28s)
00:53:28

[learning so deep learning means a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m32s)
00:53:32

[network with multiple hidden layers so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m34s)
00:53:34

[when you put all this together there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m41s)
00:53:41

[actually really amazing what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m43s)
00:53:43

[Google started investing in deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m46s)
00:53:46

[learning in 2012 they actually hired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m49s)
00:53:49

[Geoffrey Hinton who's kind of the father](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m54s)
00:53:54

[of deep learning and his top student](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m56s)
00:53:56

[Alex Bogusky and they started trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m59s)
00:53:59

[build a team that team became known as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m02s)
00:54:02

[Google brain and because things with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m05s)
00:54:05

[these three properties are so incredibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m10s)
00:54:10

[powerful and so incredibly flexible you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m13s)
00:54:13

[can actually see over time how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m16s)
00:54:16

[projects at Google use deep learning my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m18s)
00:54:18

[graph here only goes up through a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m23s)
00:54:23

[over a year ago but it's I know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m25s)
00:54:25

[been continuing to grow exponentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m28s)
00:54:28

[since then as well and so what you see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m29s)
00:54:29

[now is around Google that deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m32s)
00:54:32

[is used in like every part of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m35s)
00:54:35

[business and so it's really interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m37s)
00:54:37

[to see how the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m40s)
00:54:40

[this kind of simple idea that we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m44s)
00:54:44

[solve machine learning problems using a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m47s)
00:54:47

[an algorithm that has these properties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m50s)
00:54:50

[when a big company invests heavily in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m53s)
00:54:53

[actually making that happen you see this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m56s)
00:54:56

[incredible growth in how much it's used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m59s)
00:54:59

[so for example if you use the inbox by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m02s)
00:55:02

[Google software then when you receive an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m06s)
00:55:06

[email from somebody it will often tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m09s)
00:55:09

[you here are some replies that I could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m14s)
00:55:14

[send for you and so it's actually using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m17s)
00:55:17

[deep learning here to read the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m19s)
00:55:19

[email and to generate some suggested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m22s)
00:55:22

[replies and so like this is a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m25s)
00:55:25

[great example of the kind of stuff that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m28s)
00:55:28

[previously just wasn't possible another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m31s)
00:55:31

[great example would be Microsoft is also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m35s)
00:55:35

[a little bit more recently invested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m37s)
00:55:37

[heavily in deep learning and so now you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m40s)
00:55:40

[can use Skype you can speaking to it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m42s)
00:55:42

[English and ask it at the other end to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m46s)
00:55:46

[translate it in real time to Chinese or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[Spanish and then when they talk back to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[you in Chinese or Spanish Scott will in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m54s)
00:55:54

[real-time translated the speech in in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m57s)
00:55:57

[their language into English speech in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m00s)
00:56:00

[real-time and again this is an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m03s)
00:56:03

[of stuff which we can only do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m05s)
00:56:05

[thanks to deep learning and something is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m07s)
00:56:07

[really interesting to think about how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m13s)
00:56:13

[deep learning can be combined with human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m14s)
00:56:14

[expertise so here's an example of low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m17s)
00:56:17

[drawing something just sketching it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m20s)
00:56:20

[and then using a program called neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m22s)
00:56:22

[doodle this is from a couple of years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m25s)
00:56:25

[ago - then say please take that sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m27s)
00:56:27

[and render it in the style of an artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m30s)
00:56:30

[and so here's the picture that have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m33s)
00:56:33

[created rendering it as you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m35s)
00:56:35

[impressionist painting and I think this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m38s)
00:56:38

[is a really great example of how you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m41s)
00:56:41

[use deep learning to help combine human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m44s)
00:56:44

[expertise and what computers are good at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m47s)
00:56:47

[so I a few years ago decided to try this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m53s)
00:56:53

[myself like what would happen if I took](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m58s)
00:56:58

[think learning and tried to use it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m01s)
00:57:01

[solve a really important problem and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m04s)
00:57:04

[the problem I picked was diagnosing lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m06s)
00:57:06

[cancer it turns out if you can find lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m09s)
00:57:09

[nodules earlier there's a 10 times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m14s)
00:57:14

[higher probability of survival so it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[really important problem to solve so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m21s)
00:57:21

[got together with three other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m24s)
00:57:24

[none of us had any medical background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m25s)
00:57:25

[and we grabbed a data set of CT scans we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m27s)
00:57:27

[used to compilation or neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m32s)
00:57:32

[much like the dogs vs. cats one we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m34s)
00:57:34

[trained at the start of today's lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m37s)
00:57:37

[to try and predict which CT scans had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m38s)
00:57:38

[malignant tumors in them and we ended up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m43s)
00:57:43

[after a couple of months with something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m47s)
00:57:47

[with a much lower false negative rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[and a much lower false positive rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[than a panel with four radiologists and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m53s)
00:57:53

[we went on to build this in a start-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m56s)
00:57:56

[in just into a company called analytic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m59s)
00:57:59

[which has really become pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m01s)
00:58:01

[successful and since that time the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m02s)
00:58:02

[of using deep learning for medical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m06s)
00:58:06

[imaging has become hugely popular and is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m08s)
00:58:08

[being used all around the world so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m11s)
00:58:11

[I've generally noticed is that you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m14s)
00:58:14

[the vast majority of of kind of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m16s)
00:58:16

[that people do in the world currently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m22s)
00:58:22

[aren't using deep learning and then each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m23s)
00:58:23

[time somebody says oh let's try using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m26s)
00:58:26

[deep learning to improve performance at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m28s)
00:58:28

[this thing they nearly always get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m30s)
00:58:30

[fantastic results and then suddenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m32s)
00:58:32

[everybody in that industry starts using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m34s)
00:58:34

[it as well so there's just lots and lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m36s)
00:58:36

[of opportunities here at this particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m38s)
00:58:38

[time to use deep learning to help with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m41s)
00:58:41

[all kinds of different stuff so I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m44s)
00:58:44

[jotted down a few ideas here these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m46s)
00:58:46

[all things which I know you can use deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[learning for right now to get good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m52s)
00:58:52

[results from and you know are things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m54s)
00:58:54

[which people spend a lot of money on or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m58s)
00:58:58

[have a lot of you know important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m00s)
00:59:00

[business opportunities there's lots more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m02s)
00:59:02

[as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[that these are some examples of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m06s)
00:59:06

[that maybe your company you could think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m08s)
00:59:08

[about applying deep learning for so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[let's talk about what's actually going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m13s)
00:59:13

[on what actually happened when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m15s)
00:59:15

[trained that deep learning model earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[and so as I briefly mentioned the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m21s)
00:59:21

[we created is something called a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m24s)
00:59:24

[convolutional neural network or CNN and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m26s)
00:59:26

[the key piece of a convolutional neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m29s)
00:59:29

[network is the convolution so here's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m32s)
00:59:32

[great example from our website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m36s)
00:59:36

[I've got the URL up here explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m40s)
00:59:40

[visually it's called and the explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m43s)
00:59:43

[visually website has an example of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m46s)
00:59:46

[convolution kind of in fact this over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m49s)
00:59:49

[here in the bottom left is a very zoomed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m52s)
00:59:52

[in picture of somebody's face and over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m54s)
00:59:54

[here on the right is an example of using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m57s)
00:59:57

[a convolution on that image you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m01s)
01:00:01

[here this particular thing is obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[finding edges the edges of his head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m07s)
01:00:07

[about top and bottom edges in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m14s)
01:00:14

[now how is it doing that well if we look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m16s)
01:00:16

[at each of these are all three by three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m20s)
01:00:20

[areas this is moving over it's taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m22s)
01:00:22

[each three by three area of pixels and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m24s)
01:00:24

[here are the pixel values right for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[thing in that 3x3 area and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m29s)
01:00:29

[multiplying each one of those 3 by 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m32s)
01:00:32

[pixels by each one of these 3 by 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m35s)
01:00:35

[kernel values in a convolution this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m39s)
01:00:39

[specific set of 9 values is called a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m43s)
01:00:43

[kernel it doesn't have to be 9 it could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m47s)
01:00:47

[be 4 by 4 or 5 by 5 or 3 by 2 or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m48s)
01:00:48

[whatever right in this case it's a 3 by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m52s)
01:00:52

[3 kernel and in fact a deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m54s)
01:00:54

[nearly all of our kernels are 3 by 3 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m56s)
01:00:56

[in this case the kernel is 1 - 1 / - 1 -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m00s)
01:01:00

[2 - 1 so we take each of the black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m03s)
01:01:03

[through white pixel values and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m11s)
01:01:11

[multiply as you can see each of them by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m13s)
01:01:13

[the corresponding value in the kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m16s)
01:01:16

[and then we add them all together and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m18s)
01:01:18

[if you do that for every 3x3 area you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m22s)
01:01:22

[end up with the values you see over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m25s)
01:01:25

[on the right hand side okay so very low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m28s)
01:01:28

[values become black very high values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m31s)
01:01:31

[become white and so you can see when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m35s)
01:01:35

[we're at an edge where it's black at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m38s)
01:01:38

[bottom and white at the top we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m41s)
01:01:41

[obviously going to get higher numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m44s)
01:01:44

[over here and vice versa okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m46s)
01:01:46

[a convolution so as you can see it is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m50s)
01:01:50

[linear operation and so based on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m53s)

[definition of a neural net I described](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m56s)
01:01:56

[before this can be a layer in our neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m58s)
01:01:58

[network it is a simple linear operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m01s)
01:02:01

[and we're going to look much more at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m04s)
01:02:04

[convolutions later including building a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m06s)
01:02:06

[little spreadsheet that implements them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m08s)
01:02:08

[ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m10s)
01:02:10

[so the next thing we're going to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m11s)
01:02:11

[we're going to add a nonlinear layer so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m13s)
01:02:13

[a non-linearity as it's called is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m17s)
01:02:17

[something which takes an input value and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m20s)
01:02:20

[turns it into some different value in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m24s)
01:02:24

[nonlinear way and you can see this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m27s)
01:02:27

[orange picture here is an example of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m29s)
01:02:29

[nonlinear function specifically this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m31s)
01:02:31

[something called a sigmoid and so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m34s)
01:02:34

[sigmoid is something that has this kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m37s)
01:02:37

[of S shape and this is what we used to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m39s)
01:02:39

[use as our nonlinearities in neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m41s)
01:02:41

[networks a lot actually nowadays we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m44s)
01:02:44

[nearly entirely use something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m47s)
01:02:47

[called a rally or rectified linear unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m48s)
01:02:48

[a rail u is simply take any negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m51s)
01:02:51

[numbers and replace them with 0 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m56s)
01:02:56

[leave any positive numbers as they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m58s)
01:02:58

[so in other words in code that would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m01s)
01:03:01

[y equals max X comma 0 so max X comma 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m05s)
01:03:05

[simply says replace the negatives with 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m11s)
01:03:11

[now regardless of whether you use a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m18s)
01:03:18

[sigmoid or a RAL you or something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m21s)
01:03:21

[the key point about taking this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m24s)
01:03:24

[combination of a linear layer followed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m27s)
01:03:27

[by a element-wise nonlinear function is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m29s)
01:03:29

[that it allows us to create arbitrarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m33s)
01:03:33

[complex shapes as you see in the bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m35s)
01:03:35

[right and the reason why is that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m37s)
01:03:37

[this is all from Michael Nelson's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m41s)
01:03:41

[neural networks and deep learning com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m43s)
01:03:43

[really fantastic interactive book as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[change the values of your linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m49s)
01:03:49

[functions it basically allows you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[kind of like build these arbitrarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m55s)
01:03:55

[tall or thin blocks and then combine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m58s)
01:03:58

[those blocks together and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m01s)
01:04:01

[actually the essence of the universal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m03s)
01:04:03

[approximation theorem this idea that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m06s)
01:04:06

[when you have a linear layer feeding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m08s)
01:04:08

[into a non-linearity you can actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m11s)
01:04:11

[create these arbitrarily complex shapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m13s)
01:04:13

[so this is the key idea behind why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m15s)
01:04:15

[neural networks can solve any computable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m18s)
01:04:18

[problem so then we need a way as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m22s)
01:04:22

[described to actually set these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m26s)
01:04:26

[parameters so it's all very well knowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[that we can move three a meters around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m33s)
01:04:33

[manually to try to create different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m34s)
01:04:34

[shapes but we have some specific shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m38s)
01:04:38

[we want how do we get to that shape and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m40s)
01:04:40

[so as we've discussed earlier the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m43s)
01:04:43

[idea is to use something called gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m45s)
01:04:45

[descent this is an extract from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m47s)
01:04:47

[notebook actually one of the first AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m50s)
01:04:50

[lessons and it shows actually an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m52s)
01:04:52

[of using gradient descent to solve a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m56s)
01:04:56

[simple linear regression problem but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m00s)
01:05:00

[can show you the basic idea let's say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m03s)
01:05:03

[you were just you had a simple quadratic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m06s)
01:05:06

[all right and so you are trying to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m11s)
01:05:11

[the minimum of this quadratic and so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m15s)
01:05:15

[order to find the minimum you start out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m19s)
01:05:19

[by randomly picking some point all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m22s)
01:05:22

[so we say okay let's pick let's pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m24s)
01:05:24

[here and so you go up there and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m26s)
01:05:26

[calculate the value of your quadratic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m28s)
01:05:28

[at that point so what you now want to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[is try to find a slightly better point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m33s)
01:05:33

[so what you could do is you can move a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m35s)
01:05:35

[little bit to the left and a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m39s)
01:05:39

[to the right to find out which direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m42s)
01:05:42

[is down and what you'll find out is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m44s)
01:05:44

[moving a little bit to the left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m47s)
01:05:47

[decreases the value of the function so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m48s)
01:05:48

[that looks good right and so in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[words we're calculating the derivative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m53s)
01:05:53

[there's a function at that point right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m56s)
01:05:56

[so that tells you which way is down it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m02s)
01:06:02

[the gradient and so now that we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m05s)
01:06:05

[that going to the left is down we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m07s)
01:06:07

[take a small step in that direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m09s)
01:06:09

[to create a new point and then we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m13s)
01:06:13

[repeat the process and say okay which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m17s)
01:06:17

[way is down now and we can now take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m18s)
01:06:18

[another step and another step and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m20s)
01:06:20

[another step another step another step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m23s)
01:06:23

[okay and each time we're getting closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m25s)
01:06:25

[and closer so the basic approach here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m28s)
01:06:28

[to say okay we start we're at some point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m31s)
01:06:31

[we've got some value X which is our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[current guess right that's at time step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[n so then our new guest at time step n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m40s)
01:06:40

[plus 1 is just equal to our previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m44s)
01:06:44

[guess plus the derivative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m47s)
01:06:47

[right times some small number because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m56s)
01:06:56

[want to take a small step we need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m01s)
01:07:01

[pick a small number because if we picked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m04s)
01:07:04

[a big number right then we say okay we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m06s)
01:07:06

[know we want to go to the left let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[jump a big long way to the left we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m11s)
01:07:11

[go all the way over here and we actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m13s)
01:07:13

[end up worse all right and then we do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m16s)
01:07:16

[again now we're even worse again right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m18s)
01:07:18

[so if you have too high a step size you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m21s)
01:07:21

[can actually end up with divergence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m27s)
01:07:27

[rather than convergence so this number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m29s)
01:07:29

[here we're going to be talking about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[a lot during this course and we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m33s)
01:07:33

[to be writing all this stuff out in code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m35s)
01:07:35

[from scratch ourselves but this number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m37s)
01:07:37

[here is called the learning rate okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m39s)
01:07:39

[you can see here this is an example of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m48s)
01:07:48

[basically starting out with some random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m52s)
01:07:52

[line and then using gradient descent to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m54s)
01:07:54

[gradually make the line better and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m56s)
01:07:56

[better and better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m58s)
01:07:58

[so what happens when you combine these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[ideas right the convolution the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m03s)
01:08:03

[non-linearity and gradient descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m05s)
01:08:05

[because they're all tiny small simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m07s)
01:08:07

[little things it doesn't sound that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m10s)
01:08:10

[exciting but if you have enough of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m11s)
01:08:11

[kernels right with enough layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m16s)
01:08:16

[something really interesting happens and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m19s)
01:08:19

[we can actually draw them so here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m22s)
01:08:22

[so this is a really interesting paper by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m29s)
01:08:29

[Matt Siler and Rob Fergus and what they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m32s)
01:08:32

[did a few years ago was they figured out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m34s)
01:08:34

[how to basically draw a picture of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m38s)
01:08:38

[each layer in a deep learning net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m40s)
01:08:40

[Network learned and so they showed that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m42s)
01:08:42

[layer one of the network here are nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m46s)
01:08:46

[examples of convolutional filters from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m49s)
01:08:49

[layer one of a trained network and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m52s)
01:08:52

[found that some of the filters kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m55s)
01:08:55

[learnt these diagonal lines or simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m56s)
01:08:56

[dat or grid patterns some of them learnt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m59s)
01:08:59

[these simple gradients right and so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m01s)
01:09:01

[each of these filters they show nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m04s)
01:09:04

[examples of little pieces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m07s)

[of actual photos which activate that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m09s)

[filter quite highly right so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m12s)
01:09:12

[layer one these learnt or ever these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m15s)
01:09:15

[these are learnt using gradient descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[these filters were not programmed they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m20s)
01:09:20

[will learnt using gradient descent so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m23s)
01:09:23

[other words we were learning these nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m26s)
01:09:26

[numbers so layer two then was going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m31s)
01:09:31

[take these as inputs and combine them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m39s)
01:09:39

[together and so layer two had you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m43s)
01:09:43

[this is like my in kind of attempts to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m46s)
01:09:46

[draw one of the examples of the filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[in layer two they're pretty hard to draw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m51s)
01:09:51

[but what you can do is say if the each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m54s)
01:09:54

[filter what are examples of little bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m56s)
01:09:56

[of images that activated them and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m59s)
01:09:59

[can see by layer two we've got basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m01s)
01:10:01

[something that's being activated nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m04s)
01:10:04

[entirely by little bits of sunset some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m06s)
01:10:06

[things that's being activated by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m09s)
01:10:09

[circular objects something that's being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m10s)
01:10:10

[activated by repeating horizontal lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m14s)
01:10:14

[something that's being activated by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m17s)
01:10:17

[corners so you can see how we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m19s)
01:10:19

[basically combining layer one features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m22s)
01:10:22

[together so if we combine those features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m24s)
01:10:24

[together and again these are all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m27s)
01:10:27

[convolutional filters won't through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m29s)
01:10:29

[gradient descent by the third layer it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m31s)
01:10:31

[actually learn to recognize the presence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m34s)
01:10:34

[of text another filter has learnt to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m37s)
01:10:37

[recognize the presence of petals another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m40s)
01:10:40

[filter has learnt to recognize the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m43s)
01:10:43

[presence of human faces right so just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m45s)
01:10:45

[three layers is enough to get some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m48s)
01:10:48

[pretty rich behavior so but by the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m50s)
01:10:50

[we get to layer five we've got something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m53s)
01:10:53

[that can recognize the eyeballs of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m56s)
01:10:56

[insects and birds and something that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m58s)
01:10:58

[recognize unicycle wheels alright so so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m01s)
01:11:01

[this is kind of where we start with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m05s)
01:11:05

[something incredibly simple right but if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m07s)
01:11:07

[we use it as a big enough scale thanks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m12s)
01:11:12

[to the universal approximation theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m15s)
01:11:15

[and the use of multiple hidden layers in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m17s)
01:11:17

[deep learning we actually get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m20s)
01:11:20

[very very rich capabilities so that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m23s)
01:11:23

[what we used when we actually trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m28s)
01:11:28

[our little dog vs cat recognizer okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m32s)
01:11:32

[let's talk more about this dog vs cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m40s)
01:11:40

[recognizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m44s)
01:11:44

[so we've learnt the idea of like we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m45s)
01:11:45

[look at the pictures that come out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m48s)
01:11:48

[the other end to see what the model is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m49s)
01:11:49

[classifying well like as I find badly or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m50s)
01:11:50

[which ones it's unsure about but let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m53s)
01:11:53

[talk about like this key thing I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m56s)
01:11:56

[mentioned which is the learning rate so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m59s)
01:11:59

[I mentioned we have to set this thing I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m01s)
01:12:01

[just caught it L before the learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m03s)
01:12:03

[rate and you might have noticed there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[a couple of numbers these kind of magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m07s)
01:12:07

[numbers here the first one is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m09s)
01:12:09

[learning rate right so this number is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m13s)
01:12:13

[how much do you want to multiply the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m15s)
01:12:15

[gradient by when you're taking each step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m17s)
01:12:17

[in your gradient descent we already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m19s)
01:12:19

[talked about why you wouldn't want it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m24s)
01:12:24

[be too high right but probably also it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m25s)
01:12:25

[obvious to see why you wouldn't want it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[to be too low if you had it too low you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m31s)
01:12:31

[would take like a little step and you'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m35s)
01:12:35

[be a little bit closer and little bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m37s)
01:12:37

[too little step little step and it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m39s)
01:12:39

[take lots and lots and lots of steps and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m41s)
01:12:41

[it would take too long so setting this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m43s)
01:12:43

[number well is actually really important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m46s)
01:12:46

[and for the longest time this was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m49s)
01:12:49

[driving deep learning researchers crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m52s)
01:12:52

[because they didn't really know a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m55s)
01:12:55

[way to set this reliably so the good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m59s)
01:12:59

[news is last year a researcher came up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m02s)
01:13:02

[with an approach to quite reliably set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m07s)
01:13:07

[the learning rate unfortunately almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m10s)
01:13:10

[nobody noticed so almost no deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m13s)
01:13:13

[learning researchers I know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m16s)
01:13:16

[actually are aware of this approach but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m18s)
01:13:18

[it's incredibly successful and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m21s)
01:13:21

[incredibly simple and I'll show you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m22s)
01:13:22

[idea right it's built into the fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m25s)
01:13:25

[library as something called @lr find or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m27s)
01:13:27

[the learning rate finder and it comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m29s)
01:13:29

[from this paper I was actually 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m32s)
01:13:32

[paper sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m34s)
01:13:34

[cyclic or learning rates for training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m36s)
01:13:36

[neural networks by a terrific researcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m37s)
01:13:37

[called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m39s)
01:13:39

[Leslie Smith and I'll show you Leslie's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m40s)
01:13:40

[idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m43s)
01:13:43

[so Leslie's ideas started out with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[same basic idea that we've seen before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m50s)
01:13:50

[which is if we're going to optimize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m53s)
01:13:53

[something pick some random point take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m55s)
01:13:55

[its gradient all right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[specifically he said take a tiny tiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[step like tiny step so a learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m05s)
01:14:05

[of like 10 e next seven all right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m10s)
01:14:10

[then do it again again but each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m12s)
01:14:12

[increase the learning rate like double](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m15s)
01:14:15

[it so then we try like to wean X 7 14 X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m18s)
01:14:18

[7 18 X 7 10 in X 6 right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m21s)
01:14:21

[gradually your steps are getting bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m26s)
01:14:26

[and bigger right and so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m30s)
01:14:30

[what's going to happen it's gonna like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m35s)
01:14:35

[start doing almost nothing right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m36s)
01:14:36

[it's going to then suddenly the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m39s)
01:14:39

[function is going to improve very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m41s)
01:14:41

[quickly right but then it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m43s)
01:14:43

[step even further again and then even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m45s)
01:14:45

[further again all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m50s)
01:14:50

[let's draw the rest of that line to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m53s)
01:14:53

[clear all right and so suddenly it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m55s)
01:14:55

[then going to shoot off and get much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m01s)
01:15:01

[worse right so the idea then is to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m02s)
01:15:02

[back and say okay at what point did we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m09s)
01:15:09

[see like the best improvement so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m17s)
01:15:17

[we've got our best improvement right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m26s)
01:15:26

[so I would say ok let's use that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m29s)
01:15:29

[learning rate right so in other words if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m32s)
01:15:32

[we were to plot the learning rate over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m35s)
01:15:35

[time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m41s)
01:15:41

[it was increasing like so alright and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m42s)
01:15:42

[what we then want to do is we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m48s)
01:15:48

[plot the learning rate against the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m50s)
01:15:50

[right so when I say the loss I basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[mean like how accurate is the model how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m56s)
01:15:56

[close in this case the loss would be how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m59s)
01:15:59

[far away is the predictive prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m02s)
01:16:02

[from the from the goal okay and so if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m05s)
01:16:05

[plotted the learning rate against the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m09s)
01:16:09

[loss we'd say like okay initially it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m11s)
01:16:11

[didn't do very much right for small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m14s)
01:16:14

[learning rates and then it suddenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m17s)
01:16:17

[improved a lot and then it suddenly got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m18s)
01:16:18

[a lot worse so that's the basic idea and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m22s)
01:16:22

[so we'd be looking for the point where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m25s)
01:16:25

[this graph is dropping quickly right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[we're not looking for its minimum point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m31s)
01:16:31

[we're not saying like where was it the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m33s)
01:16:33

[lowest because that could actually be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m34s)
01:16:34

[the point where it's just jumped too far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m36s)
01:16:36

[we want at what point was it dropping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m38s)
01:16:38

[the fastest so if you go so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m40s)
01:16:40

[create your learn object in the same way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m48s)
01:16:48

[that we did before we'll be learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m50s)
01:16:50

[more about this these details shortly if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m51s)
01:16:51

[you then call LR find method on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m54s)
01:16:54

[you'll see that it'll start training a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m57s)
01:16:57

[model like it did before but it'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m00s)
01:17:00

[generally stop before it gets to 100%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m03s)
01:17:03

[okay because if it notices that the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m06s)
01:17:06

[is getting a lot worse then it'll stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m10s)
01:17:10

[automatically that's what you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m14s)
01:17:14

[here it stopped at 84% and so then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m15s)
01:17:15

[can call one said that gets you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m18s)
01:17:18

[learning rate scheduler that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[object which actually does this learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m23s)
01:17:23

[rate finding and that object has a plot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m25s)
01:17:25

[learning rate function and so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m27s)
01:17:27

[see here over by iteration you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m29s)
01:17:29

[the learning rate alright so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m32s)
01:17:32

[each step the learning rate is getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m34s)
01:17:34

[bigger and bigger you can do it this way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m36s)
01:17:36

[we can see it's increasing exponentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m40s)
01:17:40

[another way that Leslie Smith the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m42s)
01:17:42

[researcher suggests is to do it linearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m44s)
01:17:44

[so I'm actually currently researching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m47s)
01:17:47

[with both of these approaches to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m49s)
01:17:49

[which works best recently I've been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m50s)
01:17:50

[mainly using exponential but I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m53s)
01:17:53

[starting to look more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m55s)
01:17:55

[using Linea at the moment and so if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[then call shed but plot that does the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m59s)
01:17:59

[plot that I just described down here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m02s)
01:18:02

[learning rate versus loss all right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m04s)
01:18:04

[so we're looking for the highest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m08s)
01:18:08

[learning rate we can find where the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m10s)
01:18:10

[is still improving clearly well right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m14s)
01:18:14

[and so in this case I would say 10 to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m17s)
01:18:17

[the negative 2x that 10 to the negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m22s)
01:18:22

[1 it's not improving right 10 to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m23s)
01:18:23

[negative 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m27s)
01:18:27

[it is also improving but I'm trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m27s)
01:18:27

[find the highest learning rate I can or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m29s)
01:18:29

[it's still clearly improving so I'd say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m32s)
01:18:32

[10 to the negative 2 okay so you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m33s)
01:18:33

[have noticed that when we ran our model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m36s)
01:18:36

[before we had 10 to the negative to 0.01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m38s)
01:18:38

[so that's why we picked that learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m44s)
01:18:44

[rate so there's really only one other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m45s)
01:18:45

[number that we have to pick and that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m51s)
01:18:51

[this number three and so that number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m57s)
01:18:57

[three controlled how many epochs did we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m00s)
01:19:00

[run so an epoch means going through our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m04s)
01:19:04

[entire data set of images and using each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m08s)
01:19:08

[each time we do a bunch of they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m12s)
01:19:12

[called mini batches we grab like 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m15s)
01:19:15

[images at a time and use them to try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m18s)
01:19:18

[improve the model a little bit using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m21s)
01:19:21

[gradient descent right and using all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m22s)
01:19:22

[the images once is called one epoch and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m24s)
01:19:24

[so at the end of each epoch we print out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m28s)
01:19:28

[the accuracy and validation and training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m31s)
01:19:31

[loss at the end of the epoch so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m35s)
01:19:35

[question of how many epochs should be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m40s)
01:19:40

[run is kind of the one other question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m43s)
01:19:43

[that you need to answer to run these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m45s)
01:19:45

[three lines of code and the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m47s)
01:19:47

[really to me is like as many as you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m50s)
01:19:50

[what you might find happen is if you run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m54s)
01:19:54

[it for too long the accuracy you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m58s)
01:19:58

[start getting worse all right and we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[learn about that why later it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m03s)
01:20:03

[something called overfitting right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m04s)
01:20:04

[you can run it for a while run lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m06s)
01:20:06

[epochs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m09s)
01:20:09

[once you see it getting worse you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m10s)
01:20:10

[how many epochs you can run and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m12s)
01:20:12

[other thing that might happen is if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m14s)
01:20:14

[you've got like a really big model or a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m16s)
01:20:16

[lot lots and lots of data maybe it takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m18s)
01:20:18

[so long you don't have time and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m19s)
01:20:19

[just run enough epochs that fit into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m21s)
01:20:21

[time you have available so the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m25s)
01:20:25

[epochs you run you know that's a pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m26s)
01:20:26

[easy thing to set so there are the only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m28s)
01:20:28

[two numbers you're gonna have to see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m31s)
01:20:31

[and so the goal this week will be to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m33s)
01:20:33

[make sure that you can run not only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m37s)
01:20:37

[these three lines of code on the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m40s)
01:20:40

[that I provided but to run it on a set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m42s)
01:20:42

[of images that you either have on your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m46s)
01:20:46

[computer or that you get from work well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m49s)
01:20:49

[that you download from Google and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m52s)
01:20:52

[try to get a sense of like which kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m54s)
01:20:54

[of images this is seem to work well for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m57s)
01:20:57

[which ones doesn't it work well for what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m00s)
01:21:00

[kind of learning rates do you need for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m04s)
01:21:04

[different kinds of images how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m06s)
01:21:06

[epochs do you need how does the number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m08s)
01:21:08

[of the learning rate change the accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m10s)
01:21:10

[you get and so forth like really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m12s)
01:21:12

[experiment and then you know try to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m14s)
01:21:14

[a sense of like what's inside this data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m18s)
01:21:18

[object you know what are the y-values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m20s)
01:21:20

[look like what are these places mean if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m22s)
01:21:22

[you're not familiar with numpy you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m25s)
01:21:25

[really practice a lot with numpy so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m27s)
01:21:27

[by the time you come back for the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m31s)
01:21:31

[you know we're going to be digging into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m33s)
01:21:33

[a lot more detail and so you'll really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m35s)
01:21:35

[feel ready to do that now one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m37s)
01:21:37

[that's really important to be able to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m40s)
01:21:40

[that is that you need to really know how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m42s)
01:21:42

[to work with numpy the faster a library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m44s)
01:21:44

[and so forth and so I want to show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m50s)
01:21:50

[some tricks in Jupiter notebook to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m52s)
01:21:52

[that much easier so one trick to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m54s)
01:21:54

[aware of is if you can't quite remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m58s)
01:21:58

[how to spell something right so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m00s)
01:22:00

[you're not quite sure what the method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m03s)
01:22:03

[you want is you can always hit tab and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m06s)
01:22:06

[you'll get a list of methods that start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m08s)
01:22:08

[with that letter right and so that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m12s)
01:22:12

[quick way to find things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[if you then can't remember what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m15s)
01:22:15

[arguments are to a method hit shift tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m16s)
01:22:16

[all right so hitting shift tab tells you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m21s)
01:22:21

[the arguments to the method so shift tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m24s)
01:22:24

[is like one of the most helpful things I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m27s)
01:22:27

[know so let's take in P X P shift tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m29s)
01:22:29

[and so now you might be wondering like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m36s)
01:22:36

[okay well what does this function do and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m39s)
01:22:39

[how does it work if you press shift tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m41s)
01:22:41

[twice then it actually brings up the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m44s)
01:22:44

[documentation shows you what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m47s)
01:22:47

[parameters are and shows you what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m49s)
01:22:49

[returns and gives you examples okay if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m51s)
01:22:51

[you press it three times then it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m57s)
01:22:57

[actually pops up a whole little separate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m00s)
01:23:00

[window with that information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m01s)
01:23:01

[okay so shift tab is super helpful one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m03s)
01:23:03

[way to grab that window straight away is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m07s)
01:23:07

[if you just put question mark at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[start then it just brings up that little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m12s)
01:23:12

[documentation window now the other thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m15s)
01:23:15

[to be aware of is increasingly during](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m19s)
01:23:19

[this course we're going to be looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m22s)
01:23:22

[the actual source code of fast AI itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m23s)
01:23:23

[and learning how it's built and why it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m25s)
01:23:25

[built that way it's really helpful to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m28s)
01:23:28

[look at source code in order to you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m31s)
01:23:31

[understand what you can do and how you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m33s)
01:23:33

[can do it so if you for example wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m36s)
01:23:36

[to look at the source code for learned I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m38s)
01:23:38

[predict you can just put two question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m40s)
01:23:40

[marks okay and you can see it's popped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m42s)
01:23:42

[up the source code right and so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m46s)
01:23:46

[just a single line of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m49s)
01:23:49

[you're very often find that fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m50s)
01:23:50

[methods like they they're designed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m52s)
01:23:52

[never be more than about half a screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m55s)
01:23:55

[full of code and they're often under six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m59s)
01:23:59

[lines so you can see this case it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m01s)
01:24:01

[calling predicted with tags so we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m02s)
01:24:02

[then get the source code for that in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m05s)
01:24:05

[same way okay and then that's calling a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m06s)
01:24:06

[function called predicted with tags so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m12s)
01:24:12

[we could get that documentation for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m14s)
01:24:14

[in the same way and then so here yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m15s)
01:24:15

[and then finally that's what it does it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m17s)
01:24:17

[either rates through a data loader gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m19s)
01:24:19

[the predictions and then passes them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[back and so forth okay so question mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m23s)
01:24:23

[question mark is how to get source code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m27s)
01:24:27

[but the single question mark is how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m30s)
01:24:30

[get documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m32s)
01:24:32

[and shift-tab is how to bring up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m34s)
01:24:34

[parameters or press it more times to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m36s)
01:24:36

[the docs so that's really helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m39s)
01:24:39

[another really helpful thing to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m42s)
01:24:42

[about is how to use Jupiter notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m44s)
01:24:44

[well and the button that you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m47s)
01:24:47

[know is H if you press H it will bring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m49s)
01:24:49

[up the keyboard shortcuts palette and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m53s)
01:24:53

[now you can see exactly what Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m56s)
01:24:56

[notebook can do and how to do it I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m58s)
01:24:58

[personally find all of these functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[useful so I generally tell students to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m02s)
01:25:02

[try and learn four or five different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m05s)
01:25:05

[keyboard shortcuts a day try them out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m07s)
01:25:07

[see what they do see how they work and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m10s)
01:25:10

[then you can try practicing in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m12s)
01:25:12

[session and one very important thing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m14s)
01:25:14

[remember when you're finished with your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m17s)
01:25:17

[work for the day go back to a paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m19s)
01:25:19

[space and click on that little button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m21s)
01:25:21

[which stops and starts the machine so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m23s)
01:25:23

[after it's stopped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m26s)
01:25:26

[you'll see it says connection closed and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m27s)
01:25:27

[you'll see it's off if you leave it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m29s)
01:25:29

[running you'll be charged for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m31s)
01:25:31
