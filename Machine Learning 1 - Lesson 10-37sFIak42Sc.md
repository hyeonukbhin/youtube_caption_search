[well welcome back to machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m00s)
00:00:00

[one of the most exciting things this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m02s)
00:00:02

[week almost certainly the most exciting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m05s)
00:00:05

[the thing this week is that fast AI is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m08s)
00:00:08

[now on Pitt so you can pip install fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m10s)
00:00:10

[AI and so thank you to Prince and perk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m14s)
00:00:14

[to creme for making that happen to USF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m19s)
00:00:19

[students who had never published a hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m23s)
00:00:23

[package before and this is one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m24s)
00:00:24

[harder ones to publish because it's got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m26s)
00:00:26

[a lot of dependencies so it's you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m27s)
00:00:27

[probably still easiest just to do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m33s)
00:00:33

[Condor end of update thing but a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m34s)
00:00:34

[of places that it would be handy instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m38s)
00:00:38

[to pip install fast AI would be well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m40s)
00:00:40

[obviously if you're working outside of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m42s)
00:00:42

[the the repo in the notebooks then this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m45s)
00:00:45

[gives you access to fast AI everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m47s)
00:00:47

[also I believe they submitted a pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m50s)
00:00:50

[request to CAG or to try and get it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m53s)
00:00:53

[added to the Capitol kernels so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m54s)
00:00:54

[hopefully you'll be able to use it on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m56s)
00:00:56

[Kapil kernels soon and yeah you can use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h00m57s)
00:00:57

[it at your work or whatever else so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m01s)
00:01:01

[that's that's exciting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m05s)
00:01:05

[I mean I I'm not gonna say it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m07s)
00:01:07

[officially released yet you know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m08s)
00:01:08

[still very early obviously and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m11s)
00:01:11

[still you're helping add documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m13s)
00:01:13

[and all that kind of stuff but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m16s)
00:01:16

[great that that's now there a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m18s)
00:01:18

[cool kernels from USF students this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m23s)
00:01:23

[thought of highlight two that were both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m26s)
00:01:26

[from the text normalization competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m28s)
00:01:28

[which was about trying to take text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m32s)
00:01:32

[which was written out you know wrote a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m37s)
00:01:37

[standard English text they also had one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m43s)
00:01:43

[per Russian and you're trying to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m45s)
00:01:45

[identify things that could be like first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m47s)
00:01:47

[second third and say like that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m50s)
00:01:50

[cardinal number or this is a phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m51s)
00:01:51

[number or whatever and I did a quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m53s)
00:01:53

[little bit of searching and I saw that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m56s)
00:01:56

[there had been some attempts in academia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h01m57s)
00:01:57

[to use deep learning for this but they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m01s)
00:02:01

[hadn't managed to make much progress and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m04s)
00:02:04

[actually noticed so up here is Colonel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m06s)
00:02:06

[here which gets 0.99 two on the leader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m10s)
00:02:10

[board which i think is like top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m12s)
00:02:12

[is yeah it's kind of entirely heuristic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m14s)
00:02:14

[and it's a great example of kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m17s)
00:02:17

[feature engineering that's in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m20s)
00:02:20

[the whole thing is basically entirely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m21s)
00:02:21

[feature engineering so it's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m22s)
00:02:22

[looking through and using most of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m25s)
00:02:25

[regular expressions to figure out for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m26s)
00:02:26

[each token what is it you know and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m28s)
00:02:28

[think she's done a great job here kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m32s)
00:02:32

[of laying it all out clearly as to what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m33s)
00:02:33

[all the different pieces are and how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m35s)
00:02:35

[they all fit together and she mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m37s)
00:02:37

[that she's maybe hoping to turn this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m40s)
00:02:40

[into a library which I think would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m42s)
00:02:42

[great right you know you could use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m43s)
00:02:43

[to grab a piece of text and pull out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m44s)
00:02:44

[what are all the pieces in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m48s)
00:02:48

[it's the kind of thing that the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m51s)
00:02:51

[natural language can like natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m54s)
00:02:54

[language processing community hopes to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m56s)
00:02:56

[be able to do without like lots of hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h02m58s)
00:02:58

[written code like this but for now this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m01s)
00:03:01

[is I'll be interesting to see like what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m03s)
00:03:03

[the winners turn out to have done but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m05s)
00:03:05

[haven't seen machine learning being used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m07s)
00:03:07

[really to do this particularly well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m10s)
00:03:10

[perhaps the best approaches or ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m13s)
00:03:13

[which combine this kind of feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m15s)
00:03:15

[engineering along with some machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m17s)
00:03:17

[learning but I think this is a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m19s)
00:03:19

[example of effective feature engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[and this is a another USF student who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m24s)
00:03:24

[has done much the same thing got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m27s)
00:03:27

[similar kind of score but used used her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m30s)
00:03:30

[own different set of rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m33s)
00:03:33

[again this is gets you it would get you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m35s)
00:03:35

[a good leader board position with these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m38s)
00:03:38

[as well so I thought that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m40s)
00:03:40

[interesting to see examples of some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m42s)
00:03:42

[our students entering a competition and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m44s)
00:03:44

[getting kind of top 20 ish results by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[you know basically just handwritten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m51s)
00:03:51

[heuristics and this is where for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m53s)
00:03:53

[computer vision was six years ago still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h03m56s)
00:03:56

[basically all the best approaches was a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m01s)
00:04:01

[whole lot of like carefully handwritten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m03s)
00:04:03

[heuristics often combined with some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m05s)
00:04:05

[simple machine learning and so I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m08s)
00:04:08

[over time you know the field is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m11s)
00:04:11

[definitely trying to move towards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m15s)
00:04:15

[automating much more of this and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m18s)
00:04:18

[actually interestingly very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m20s)
00:04:20

[interestingly in the safe driver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m23s)
00:04:23

[diction competition was just finished](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[one of the Netflix Prize winners won](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m30s)
00:04:30

[this competition and he invented a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m33s)
00:04:33

[algorithm for dealing with structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m37s)
00:04:37

[data which basically doesn't require any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m39s)
00:04:39

[feature engineering at all so he came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m42s)
00:04:42

[first place using nothing but five deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m45s)
00:04:45

[learning models and one gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m50s)
00:04:50

[boosting machine and his his basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m52s)
00:04:52

[approach was very similar to what we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m56s)
00:04:56

[been learning in this class so far and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h04m58s)
00:04:58

[what we'll be learning also tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m00s)
00:05:00

[which is using fully connected neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m03s)
00:05:03

[network somewhere and one hot encoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m05s)
00:05:05

[and specifically embedding which we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m07s)
00:05:07

[learn about but he had a very clever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m10s)
00:05:10

[technique which was there was a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m12s)
00:05:12

[data in this competition which was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m14s)
00:05:14

[unlabeled so in other words where they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m16s)
00:05:16

[didn't know whether that driver would go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m19s)
00:05:19

[under claim or not or or whatever so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m23s)
00:05:23

[unlabeled data so when you've got some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m25s)
00:05:25

[labeled in some unlabeled data we call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m27s)
00:05:27

[that semi-supervised learning and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m30s)
00:05:30

[real life most learning is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m32s)
00:05:32

[semi-supervised learning like in real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[life normally you have some things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m36s)
00:05:36

[are labeled and some things that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m38s)
00:05:38

[unlabeled so this is kind of the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m39s)
00:05:39

[practically useful kind of learning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m41s)
00:05:41

[then structured data is it's the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m44s)
00:05:44

[common kind of data that companies deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m47s)
00:05:47

[with day to day so the fact that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m48s)
00:05:48

[competition was a semi-supervised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m50s)
00:05:50

[structured data competition made it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m53s)
00:05:53

[incredibly practically useful and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[what his technique for winning this was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h05m58s)
00:05:58

[was to through data augmentation which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m00s)
00:06:00

[those of you doing the deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m06s)
00:06:06

[course have learned about which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m07s)
00:06:07

[basically the idea like if you had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m08s)
00:06:08

[pictures you would like flip them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m09s)
00:06:09

[horizontally or rotate them a bit later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m11s)
00:06:11

[orientation means creating new data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m13s)
00:06:13

[examples which are kind of slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m15s)
00:06:15

[different versions of ones you already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m18s)
00:06:18

[have and the way he did it was for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m20s)
00:06:20

[row from the data he would like at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m23s)
00:06:23

[random replaced 15% of the variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m27s)
00:06:27

[with a different row so each row now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m31s)
00:06:31

[would represent like a mix of like 80%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m34s)
00:06:34

[85% of the original row the 15% randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m36s)
00:06:36

[selected from a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m40s)
00:06:40

[and so this was a way of like randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m42s)
00:06:42

[changing the data a little bit and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m45s)
00:06:45

[he used something called an autoencoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m47s)
00:06:47

[which we will probably won't study into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m50s)
00:06:50

[a part too with a deep learning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m53s)
00:06:53

[but the basic idea of an autoencoder is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m54s)
00:06:54

[your dependent variable is the same as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m56s)
00:06:56

[your independent variable so in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h06m59s)
00:06:59

[words you try to predict your input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m01s)
00:07:01

[which obviously is trivial if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m04s)
00:07:04

[allowed to like like you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m09s)
00:07:09

[identity transporting for example Rivoli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m11s)
00:07:11

[predicts the input but the trick with an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m13s)
00:07:13

[autoencoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m15s)
00:07:15

[is to have less activations in at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m16s)
00:07:16

[one of your layers than your input right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m20s)
00:07:20

[so if your input was like a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m23s)
00:07:23

[dimensional vector and you put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m25s)
00:07:25

[through a 100 by 10 matrix okay create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m27s)
00:07:27

[ten activations and then have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m31s)
00:07:31

[recreate the original 100 long vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m33s)
00:07:33

[from that then you've basically come you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m35s)
00:07:35

[had to have compressed it effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m38s)
00:07:38

[and so it turns out that that kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m40s)
00:07:40

[neural network you know is forced to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m43s)
00:07:43

[find correlations and features and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m46s)
00:07:46

[interesting relationships in the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[even when it's not labeled so he used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m52s)
00:07:52

[that rather than doing any he didn't do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m55s)
00:07:55

[any hand engineering he just used an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m57s)
00:07:57

[autoencoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[so you know these are some interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[kind of directions that if you keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m02s)
00:08:02

[going with your machine learning studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m04s)
00:08:04

[you know particularly if you do a part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m06s)
00:08:06

[two with a deep learning course next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m10s)
00:08:10

[year your your lone about and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m11s)
00:08:11

[kind of see how feature engineering is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m17s)
00:08:17

[going away and this was just yeah an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[hour ago so this is very recent using to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m22s)
00:08:22

[eat but it's one of this is one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m25s)
00:08:25

[most important breakthroughs I've seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[in a long time okay so we were working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[through a simple logistic regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m36s)
00:08:36

[trained with SJD for MS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m42s)
00:08:42

[and here's the summary of where we got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m49s)
00:08:49

[to we have nearly built a module a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m51s)
00:08:51

[module and a training loop from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h08m58s)
00:08:58

[and we were going to kind of try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m01s)
00:09:01

[finish that and after we finished that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m02s)
00:09:02

[and then going to go through this entire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m04s)
00:09:04

[notebook backwards right so having gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m06s)
00:09:06

[like top to bottom but I'm going to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m09s)
00:09:09

[back through bottom to top okay so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[know this was that little handwritten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m16s)
00:09:16

[and end module class we created we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m18s)
00:09:18

[defined our loss we defined our learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m22s)
00:09:22

[rate and we defined our optimizer and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m25s)
00:09:25

[this is the thing that we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[try and write by hand in a moment so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m28s)
00:09:28

[that stuff that and that we're stealing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m30s)
00:09:30

[with from pi torch but that we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m35s)
00:09:35

[written ourselves and this week written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[us all so the basic idea was we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m38s)
00:09:38

[to go through some number of epochs so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m40s)
00:09:40

[let's go through one epoch okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m42s)
00:09:42

[we're going to keep track of how much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[for each mini batch what was the loss so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m46s)
00:09:46

[that we can report it at the end we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[going to turn our training data loader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[into an iterator so that we can loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m54s)
00:09:54

[through it live through every mini batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m56s)
00:09:56

[and so now we can go and go ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h09m58s)
00:09:58

[say for tensor in the length of the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[loader and then we can call next to grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m05s)
00:10:05

[the next independent variables and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m08s)
00:10:08

[dependent variables from our data loader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m10s)
00:10:10

[from that iterator okay so then remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m13s)
00:10:13

[we can then pass the X tensor into our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m16s)
00:10:16

[model by calling the model as if it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m20s)
00:10:20

[a function but first of all we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m23s)
00:10:23

[turn into a variable last week we were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m25s)
00:10:25

[typing variable blog CUDA to turn it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m27s)
00:10:27

[into a variable a shorthand for that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m30s)
00:10:30

[just the capital V now it's a capital T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m32s)
00:10:32

[for a tensor capital B for a fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m35s)
00:10:35

[variable that's just a shortcut in fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m37s)
00:10:37

[AI okay so that returns our predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m39s)
00:10:39

[and so the next thing we needed was to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m42s)
00:10:42

[calculate our loss because we can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m44s)
00:10:44

[calculate the derivatives of the loss of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m48s)
00:10:48

[U and calculate the loss so the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[takes the predictions and the actuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m51s)
00:10:51

[okay so the actuals again are the the Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m54s)
00:10:54

[tensor and again we have to turn that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m56s)
00:10:56

[into a variable now can anybody remind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h10m59s)
00:10:59

[me what a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m01s)
00:11:01

[variable is and why we would want to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m03s)
00:11:03

[a variable here I think once you turn it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m05s)
00:11:05

[to variable then it tracks it so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m13s)
00:11:13

[you can do a backward on that so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m15s)
00:11:15

[yeah what sorry when you turned a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m16s)
00:11:16

[variable it it contract like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m17s)
00:11:17

[process of like you know as you add the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m19s)
00:11:19

[function as the function starting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m21s)
00:11:21

[earlier than each other they can track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m22s)
00:11:22

[it and I may need to backward on it back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m24s)
00:11:24

[propagates and those days yeah right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m25s)
00:11:25

[right so a variable keeps track of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m30s)
00:11:30

[of the steps to get computed and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m36s)
00:11:36

[there's actually a fantastic tutorial on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m41s)
00:11:41

[the PI torch website so on the pipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m44s)
00:11:44

[torch website there's a tutorial section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m54s)
00:11:54

[and there's a tutorial there about Auto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m56s)
00:11:56

[grad Auto grad is the name of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h11m59s)
00:11:59

[automatic differentiation package that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m01s)
00:12:01

[comes with a torch and it's a it's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m03s)
00:12:03

[implementation of automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m05s)
00:12:05

[differentiation and so the variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m07s)
00:12:07

[class is really the key the key class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m09s)
00:12:09

[here because that's the thing that makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m14s)
00:12:14

[turns a tensor into something where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m15s)
00:12:15

[can keep track of its gradients so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m17s)
00:12:17

[basically here they show how to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m20s)
00:12:20

[their variable do an operation to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m22s)
00:12:22

[variable and then you can go back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m25s)
00:12:25

[actually look at the grand function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m27s)
00:12:27

[which is the the function that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m30s)
00:12:30

[keeping track of basically to calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[the gradient right so as we do more and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m35s)
00:12:35

[more operations to this very variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m38s)
00:12:38

[and the variable calculated from that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m42s)
00:12:42

[variable it keeps keeping track of it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m43s)
00:12:43

[later on we can go dot backward and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m45s)
00:12:45

[print grad and find out the gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m48s)
00:12:48

[right and so you notice we never defined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m52s)
00:12:52

[the gradient we just defined it as being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m54s)
00:12:54

[X plus 2 squared times 3 whatever and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h12m57s)
00:12:57

[can calculate the gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m02s)
00:13:02

[okay so that's why we need to turn that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m11s)
00:13:11

[into a variable so L is now a variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m14s)
00:13:14

[containing the loss so it contains a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m18s)
00:13:18

[single number for this mini batch which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m20s)
00:13:20

[is the loss for this mini batch but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m23s)
00:13:23

[not just a number it's a it's a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m25s)
00:13:25

[as a variable so it's a number that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m28s)
00:13:28

[knows how it was calculated all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m29s)
00:13:29

[we're going to append that loss to our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m33s)
00:13:33

[array just so we can get the average of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m35s)
00:13:35

[it later basically and now we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m39s)
00:13:39

[to calculate the gradient so L drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m42s)
00:13:42

[backward is a thing that says calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m45s)
00:13:45

[the gradient so remember when you recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m49s)
00:13:49

[the the network it's actually calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m51s)
00:13:51

[our forward function so that's like cap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m54s)
00:13:54

[go through it forward and then backward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m56s)
00:13:56

[is like using the chain rule to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h13m58s)
00:13:58

[calculate the gradients backwards okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m00s)
00:14:00

[and then this is the thing we're about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m03s)
00:14:03

[to write which is update the weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m05s)
00:14:05

[based on the gradients and the learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m07s)
00:14:07

[rate okay zero grad will explain when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m10s)
00:14:10

[write this out by hand okay and so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m13s)
00:14:13

[at the end we can turn our validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m17s)
00:14:17

[data loader into an iterator and we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m20s)
00:14:20

[then go through its length grabbing each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m23s)
00:14:23

[X and way out of that and asking for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[score which we defined up here to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m31s)
00:14:31

[equal to which thing did you predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m35s)
00:14:35

[which thing was actual and so check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m38s)
00:14:38

[whether they're equal right and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m42s)
00:14:42

[main of that is going to be our accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m44s)
00:14:44

[okay could you pass that over to Chen XI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[what's the advantage that you found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m53s)
00:14:53

[converted into iterator resident like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m55s)
00:14:55

[used normal and on a Python loop or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h14m58s)
00:14:58

[we're using a normal Python loop so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m01s)
00:15:01

[still them this is a normal Python loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[so the question really is like compared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m07s)
00:15:07

[to what right so like the alternative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m10s)
00:15:10

[perhaps nothing here could be like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[could use like a something like a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[with an index oh okay so you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m18s)
00:15:18

[problem there is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m21s)
00:15:21

[we want as a few things I mean one key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[one is we want each time we grab a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m26s)
00:15:26

[mini batch we want to be random we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m28s)
00:15:28

[a different different shuffled thing so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m30s)
00:15:30

[this you can actually kind of iterate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m32s)
00:15:32

[from forever you know you can look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m35s)
00:15:35

[through it as many times as you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m38s)
00:15:38

[so this is kind of idea it's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m39s)
00:15:39

[different things in different languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m42s)
00:15:42

[but a lot of languages a lot like stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m44s)
00:15:44

[processing and it's this basic idea that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m46s)
00:15:46

[rather than saying I want the third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m49s)
00:15:49

[thing or the ninth thing is just like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m50s)
00:15:50

[want the next thing right it's great for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m52s)
00:15:52

[like network programming it's like grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m54s)
00:15:54

[the next thing from the network it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m56s)
00:15:56

[great for UI programming it's like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h15m58s)
00:15:58

[have the next event where there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m02s)
00:16:02

[somebody clicked a button it also turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m03s)
00:16:03

[out to be great for this kind of numeric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m05s)
00:16:05

[programming's it's like I just want the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m08s)
00:16:08

[next batch of data it means that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[data like can be kind of arbitrarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m13s)
00:16:13

[long as we're just grabbing one piece at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m16s)
00:16:16

[a time yeah so you know I mean and also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m18s)
00:16:18

[I guess the short answer is because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m23s)
00:16:23

[our PI approach works if I torch that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m26s)
00:16:26

[light torches data loaders are designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m28s)
00:16:28

[to be poured in this way and then so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m30s)
00:16:30

[Python has this concept of a generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m32s)
00:16:32

[which is like an and and just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m36s)
00:16:36

[different type of generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m39s)
00:16:39

[I want to physical gonna be a snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m40s)
00:16:40

[generator or a computer of generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m42s)
00:16:42

[okay a generator is a way that you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m43s)
00:16:43

[create a function that as it says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m48s)
00:16:48

[behaves like an iterator so like python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m49s)
00:16:49

[has recognized that this stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m51s)
00:16:51

[processing approach to programming is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m53s)
00:16:53

[like super handy and helpful and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m56s)
00:16:56

[supports it everywhere so basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h16m57s)
00:16:57

[anywhere that you user for in loop any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m00s)
00:17:00

[way you use a list comprehension those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m03s)
00:17:03

[things can always be generators or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m06s)
00:17:06

[iterators so by programming this way we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[just get a lot of flexibility I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m11s)
00:17:11

[does that sound about right Terrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m15s)
00:17:15

[you're the programming language expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m17s)
00:17:17

[did you do you want to grab that box so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m18s)
00:17:18

[you can hear so Terrence actually does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m21s)
00:17:21

[programming languages for a living so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m24s)
00:17:24

[should ask him yeah I mean the short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m25s)
00:17:25

[answer is what you said you might say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m27s)
00:17:27

[something about space but in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m31s)
00:17:31

[that all that data has to be in memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m33s)
00:17:33

[because we've got no doesn't have to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m35s)
00:17:35

[a memory so that most of the time if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m38s)
00:17:38

[could pull a mini batch from something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m40s)
00:17:40

[that most of the time with pipe torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m42s)
00:17:42

[the mini batch will be read from like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m44s)
00:17:44

[separate images spread over your disk on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m46s)
00:17:46

[demand so most of the time it's not in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m49s)
00:17:49

[memory but in in general you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m51s)
00:17:51

[keep his little in memory as possible at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m53s)
00:17:53

[a time and so the idea of stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m56s)
00:17:56

[processing also is great because you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m57s)
00:17:57

[do compositions you can pipe the data to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h17m59s)
00:17:59

[a different machine you can yeah yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m01s)
00:18:01

[the composition is great you can grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m04s)
00:18:04

[scrap the next thing from here and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m05s)
00:18:05

[send it off to the next stream which you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m06s)
00:18:06

[can then grab it and do something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m08s)
00:18:08

[which you guys all recognize of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m09s)
00:18:09

[in the command-line pipes and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m11s)
00:18:11

[redirection yes okay thanks Terrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[it's a benefit of working with people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m18s)
00:18:18

[that actually know what they're talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m20s)
00:18:20

[about all right so let's know take that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m21s)
00:18:21

[and get rid of the optimizer okay so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m26s)
00:18:26

[only thing that we're going to be left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m30s)
00:18:30

[with is the negative log likelihood loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[function which we could also replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m33s)
00:18:33

[actually we have a implementation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m36s)
00:18:36

[that from scratch that you know wrote in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m39s)
00:18:39

[the in the notebooks so it's only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m41s)
00:18:41

[line of code as we learned earlier you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m44s)
00:18:44

[can do it with a single if statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m46s)
00:18:46

[okay so I don't know why I was so lazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m47s)
00:18:47

[is to include this so what we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m50s)
00:18:50

[to do is we're gonna again grab this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m54s)
00:18:54

[module that we've written ourselves the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m56s)
00:18:56

[logistic regression module we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m57s)
00:18:57

[to have one epoch again we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h18m59s)
00:18:59

[loop through each thing in an iterator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m02s)
00:19:02

[again they're going to grab our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m04s)
00:19:04

[independent and dependent variable for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m06s)
00:19:06

[the mini batch again pass it into our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m08s)
00:19:08

[network again calculate the loss so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m10s)
00:19:10

[is all the same as before but now we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m13s)
00:19:13

[going to get rid of this optimizer dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m15s)
00:19:15

[step and we're going to do it by hand so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m17s)
00:19:17

[the basic trick is as I mentioned we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m21s)
00:19:21

[not going to do the calculus by hand so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m25s)
00:19:25

[we call L drop backward to calculate the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m27s)
00:19:27

[gradients automatically and that's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m29s)
00:19:29

[to fairly in our weight matrix so do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m31s)
00:19:31

[remember when we created our let's go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[back and look at the code for here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[that module we built so the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m44s)
00:19:44

[matrix for the for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m46s)
00:19:46

[linear layer weights recall l1 w and for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[the BIOS record l1 B all right so though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m52s)
00:19:52

[they were the attributes we created so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h19m55s)
00:19:55

[I've just put them into things called W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m01s)
00:20:01

[and B just to save some typing basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[so W is our weights B is our biases and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m07s)
00:20:07

[so the weights remember the weights are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m10s)
00:20:10

[a variable and to get the tensor out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m13s)
00:20:13

[the variable we have to use data all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m16s)
00:20:16

[right so we want to update the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m18s)
00:20:18

[tensor that's in this variable so we say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m19s)
00:20:19

[weights data minus equals so we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m22s)
00:20:22

[go in the opposite direction to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m25s)
00:20:25

[gradient the gradient tells us which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m27s)
00:20:27

[wears up we want to go down whatever is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[currently in the gradients times the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m32s)
00:20:32

[learning rate so that is the formula for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m37s)
00:20:37

[gradient descent all right so as you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m40s)
00:20:40

[see it's it's like as as easier thing as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m44s)
00:20:44

[you can possibly imagine it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m47s)
00:20:47

[literally update the weights to be equal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m48s)
00:20:48

[to be equal to whatever they are now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m51s)
00:20:51

[minus the greater the gradients times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m53s)
00:20:53

[our learning rate and do the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m56s)
00:20:56

[for the bias anybody have any questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h20m59s)
00:20:59

[about that step in terms of like why we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m03s)
00:21:03

[do it or how it did you have a question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[about that that step but when we do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m06s)
00:21:06

[next job deal the next here yes yes so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m10s)
00:21:10

[when is the end of the loop how do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m15s)
00:21:15

[grab the next element so this is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m17s)
00:21:17

[through each h-index in range of length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m20s)
00:21:20

[so is this going 0 1 2 3 at the end of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m26s)
00:21:26

[this loop it's going to print out the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m29s)
00:21:29

[mean of the validation set go back to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m32s)
00:21:32

[the start of the epoch at which point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m35s)
00:21:35

[it's going to recreate a new a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m36s)
00:21:36

[iterator okay so basically behind the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m39s)
00:21:39

[scenes in Python when you call it a on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m42s)
00:21:42

[on this it basically tells it like reset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m45s)
00:21:45

[its state to create a new iterator and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m49s)
00:21:49

[if you're interested in how that works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m52s)
00:21:52

[the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h21m56s)
00:21:56

[the code is all you know available for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m01s)
00:22:01

[you to look at so we could look at like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m04s)
00:22:04

[MD trained your is a fast AI dot data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m06s)
00:22:06

[setup model data loader so we could like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m10s)
00:22:10

[take a look at the code of that so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[could take a look at the code of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m16s)
00:22:16

[and see exactly how it's being built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m17s)
00:22:17

[right and so you can see here that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m22s)
00:22:22

[here's the next function right which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m23s)
00:22:23

[basically is keeping track of how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m26s)
00:22:26

[times it's been through in this self dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m29s)
00:22:29

[I and here's the Edith function which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m31s)
00:22:31

[the thing that gets pretty cold when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m34s)
00:22:34

[when you create a new iterator and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m36s)
00:22:36

[can see it's basically passing it off to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m37s)
00:22:37

[something else which is a type data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m39s)
00:22:39

[loader and then you can check out data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m40s)
00:22:40

[loader if you're interested to see how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m42s)
00:22:42

[that's implemented as well um so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m44s)
00:22:44

[data loader that we wrote basically uses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m47s)
00:22:47

[multi-threading to allow it to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m50s)
00:22:50

[multiple of these going on at the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m53s)
00:22:53

[time it's actually a great it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m54s)
00:22:54

[simple it's like it's only about a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m57s)
00:22:57

[screen full of code so if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h22m59s)
00:22:59

[interested in simple Modi threaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m01s)
00:23:01

[programming it's a good thing to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m02s)
00:23:02

[okay now oh yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m05s)
00:23:05

[why how do you wrap this in four epoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m09s)
00:23:09

[in range one since that'll only run once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m13s)
00:23:13

[because in real life we would normally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m15s)
00:23:15

[be running multiple so like in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m18s)
00:23:18

[because it's a linear model it actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m22s)
00:23:22

[basically trains to as good as it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m25s)
00:23:25

[going to get in one he park so if I type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m28s)
00:23:28

[three here it actually it actually won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m30s)
00:23:30

[really improve after the first epoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m37s)
00:23:37

[much at all as you can see right but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m38s)
00:23:38

[when we go back up to the top we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m42s)
00:23:42

[going to look at some slightly deeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m43s)
00:23:43

[and more interesting versions which will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m45s)
00:23:45

[take more a box so you know if I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m47s)
00:23:47

[turning this into a into a function you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m50s)
00:23:50

[know I'd be going like you know death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m52s)
00:23:52

[train model and one of the things you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m55s)
00:23:55

[would pass you and is like number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h23m58s)
00:23:58

[epochs kind of thing okay great so one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m00s)
00:24:00

[thing to remember is that when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m10s)
00:24:10

[you know creating these neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m14s)
00:24:14

[layers and remember like this is just as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m17s)
00:24:17

[pipe Rogers concerned this is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m22s)
00:24:22

[it's an end up module it could be a week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m23s)
00:24:23

[could be using it as a layer who could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m26s)
00:24:26

[be using to a function we could be using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m27s)
00:24:27

[it as a neural net pipe torch doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[think of those as different things right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m31s)
00:24:31

[so this could be a layer inside some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m33s)
00:24:33

[other network okay so how do gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m36s)
00:24:36

[work so if you've got a layer which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m39s)
00:24:39

[remember is just a bunch of we can think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m41s)
00:24:41

[of it basically as its activations right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m43s)
00:24:43

[or some activations that get computed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m45s)
00:24:45

[through some other nonlinear activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m48s)
00:24:48

[function or through some linear function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[and from that layer we it's very likely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m53s)
00:24:53

[that we're then like let's say putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h24m59s)
00:24:59

[it through a matrix product right to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[create some new layer and so each one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m04s)
00:25:04

[these so if we were to grab like one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m09s)
00:25:09

[these activations right is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m13s)
00:25:13

[going to be used to calculate every one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m16s)
00:25:16

[of these outputs right and so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[want to calculate the the derivative you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m25s)
00:25:25

[have to know how this weight matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m30s)
00:25:30

[impacts that output and that output and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m34s)
00:25:34

[that output and that output right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m37s)
00:25:37

[then you have to add all of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[together to find like the total impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m41s)
00:25:41

[of this you know across all of its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m44s)
00:25:44

[outputs and so that's why in PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m46s)
00:25:46

[you have to tell it when to set the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m52s)
00:25:52

[gradients to zero right because the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m55s)
00:25:55

[is that you know you could be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m58s)
00:25:58

[having lots of different loss functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h25m59s)
00:25:59

[or lots of different outputs in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m01s)
00:26:01

[next activate set of activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m02s)
00:26:02

[or whatever all adding up increasing or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m04s)
00:26:04

[decreasing your gradients right so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m08s)
00:26:08

[basically have to say okay this is a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m10s)
00:26:10

[calculation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m12s)
00:26:12

[reset okay so here is where we do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[so before we do LDAP backward we say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m19s)
00:26:19

[reset okay so let's take our weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m22s)
00:26:22

[let's take the gradients let's take the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m25s)
00:26:25

[ten so that they point to and then zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m28s)
00:26:28

[underscore does anybody remember from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m32s)
00:26:32

[last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[what underscore does as a suffix in pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[torched yeah I have to read the language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m37s)
00:26:37

[but basically it changes I put into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m45s)
00:26:45

[place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m47s)
00:26:47

[that language is in place yeah exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m48s)
00:26:48

[so it sounds like a minor technicality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m52s)
00:26:52

[but it's super useful to remember every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m55s)
00:26:55

[function pretty much has an underscore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m57s)
00:26:57

[version suffix which does it in place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h26m59s)
00:26:59

[yeah so normally zero returns a tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m02s)
00:27:02

[of zeros of a particular size so zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m07s)
00:27:07

[underscore means replace the contents of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m10s)
00:27:10

[this with a bunch of zeros okay all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m13s)
00:27:13

[right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[so that's that's it right so that's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m17s)
00:27:17

[SJD from scratch and if I get rid of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m22s)
00:27:22

[menu bar we can officially say it fits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m26s)
00:27:26

[within a screen yeah so of course we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m27s)
00:27:27

[haven't got our definition of logistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m32s)
00:27:32

[regression here that's another half the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m33s)
00:27:33

[screen but basically there's there's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[much to it yes sir so later on we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m36s)
00:27:36

[to do this more the gradient is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m41s)
00:27:41

[because you might find like a wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m42s)
00:27:42

[minima local minima that way we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m44s)
00:27:44

[kick it out and that's we have to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m47s)
00:27:47

[multiple times when the surface is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m48s)
00:27:48

[getting more common why do you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m50s)
00:27:50

[multiple epochs is that your question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m51s)
00:27:51

[well I mean a simple way to answer that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m52s)
00:27:52

[would be let's say our learning rate was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m54s)
00:27:54

[tiny right then it's just not gonna get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h27m56s)
00:27:56

[very far right there's nothing that says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[going through one epoch is enough to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m06s)
00:28:06

[you all the way there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m08s)
00:28:08

[so then it'd be like okay well let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m10s)
00:28:10

[increase our learning rate and it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m12s)
00:28:12

[yeah sure will increase our learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[rate but who's to say that the highest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m14s)
00:28:14

[learning rate that learned stabili is is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[enough to learn this as well as it can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m20s)
00:28:20

[be learned and for most data sets for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[most architectures one epoch is very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m25s)
00:28:25

[rarely enough to get you to the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[result you can get too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m31s)
00:28:31

[you know linear models are just they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m34s)
00:28:34

[very nicely behaved you know so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m38s)
00:28:38

[often use higher learning rates and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m40s)
00:28:40

[learn them well quickly also they they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m41s)
00:28:41

[don't you can't like generally get as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m45s)
00:28:45

[good at accuracy so there's not as far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m47s)
00:28:47

[to take them either so yeah doing one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m49s)
00:28:49

[epoch is going to be the rarity all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m52s)
00:28:52

[right so let's go backwards so going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m54s)
00:28:54

[backwards we're basically going to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m57s)
00:28:57

[all right let's not write those two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h28m59s)
00:28:59

[lines again and again again let's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m02s)
00:29:02

[write those three lines again and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m05s)
00:29:05

[and again let's have somebody do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m06s)
00:29:06

[for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[right so that's like that's the only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m09s)
00:29:09

[difference between that version in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m12s)
00:29:12

[version is rather than saying dot zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m14s)
00:29:14

[ourselves rather than saying - gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m16s)
00:29:16

[times Amara ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m20s)
00:29:20

[these are wrapped up for us okay there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m22s)
00:29:22

[is another wrinkle here which is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[approach to updating the the weights is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m30s)
00:29:30

[actually pretty inefficient it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m35s)
00:29:35

[take advantage of momentum and curvature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m38s)
00:29:38

[and so in the do course we learn about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[how to do momentum from scratch as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m47s)
00:29:47

[okay so if we actually just use plain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m49s)
00:29:49

[old SGD then you'll see that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h29m54s)
00:29:54

[Alone's much slower so now that I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m01s)
00:30:01

[typed just plain old SGD here this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m04s)
00:30:04

[now literally doing exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m06s)
00:30:06

[thing as our slow version so I have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m07s)
00:30:07

[increase the learning rate okay there we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m11s)
00:30:11

[go so this this is now the same as the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m16s)
00:30:16

[one we wrote by hand so then all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m19s)
00:30:19

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[let's do a little bit more stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m25s)
00:30:25

[automatically let's not you know given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m28s)
00:30:28

[that every time we train something we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m33s)
00:30:33

[have to loop through epoch flip through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m36s)
00:30:36

[batch do forward get the loss zero the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m38s)
00:30:38

[gradient do backward do a step of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

[optimizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m45s)
00:30:45

[let's put all that in a function okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m46s)
00:30:46

[and that function is called fit alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m49s)
00:30:49

[there it is okay so let's take a look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h30m55s)
00:30:55

[fit fit go through each epoch go through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m01s)
00:31:01

[each batch do one step keep track of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m10s)
00:31:10

[loss and at the end calculate the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m15s)
00:31:15

[validation all right and so then step so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m18s)
00:31:18

[if you're interested in looking at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m35s)
00:31:35

[this stuff's all inside fast AI dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m37s)
00:31:37

[model and so here is dead right zero the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m39s)
00:31:39

[gradients calculate the loss remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m46s)
00:31:46

[pipe torch tends to call it criterion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m49s)
00:31:49

[rather than loss all right do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m51s)
00:31:51

[backward and then there's something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m54s)
00:31:54

[we haven't learned here but we do learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m57s)
00:31:57

[the deep learning course which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m58s)
00:31:58

[gradient reading so you can ignore that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h31m59s)
00:31:59

[alright so you can see now like all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m01s)
00:32:01

[stuff that we've learnt when you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m04s)
00:32:04

[inside the actual frameworks that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m05s)
00:32:05

[code you see okay so that's what fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m08s)
00:32:08

[does and so then the next step would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m12s)
00:32:12

[like okay well this idea of like having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m16s)
00:32:16

[some weights and a bias and doing a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m19s)
00:32:19

[matrix product in addition let's put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m23s)
00:32:23

[that in a function this thing of doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m27s)
00:32:27

[the log softmax let's put that in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[function and then the very idea of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[first doing this and then doing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m34s)
00:32:34

[this idea of like chaining functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m36s)
00:32:36

[together let's put that into a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m39s)
00:32:39

[and that finally gets us to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m41s)
00:32:41

[okay so sequential simply means through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m47s)
00:32:47

[this function take the result send it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m50s)
00:32:50

[this function etc right and linear means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m52s)
00:32:52

[create the weight matrix create the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m57s)
00:32:57

[biases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h32m59s)
00:32:59

[okay so that's that's yeah right so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m00s)
00:33:00

[can then you know as we started to talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m08s)
00:33:08

[about like turn this into any deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m10s)
00:33:10

[neural network by saying you know rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m12s)
00:33:12

[than sending this straight off into ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m17s)
00:33:17

[activations let's let's put it into say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m20s)
00:33:20

[100 activations we could pick whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m23s)
00:33:23

[one number we like put it through a RAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m25s)
00:33:25

[you to make it nonlinear put it through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m29s)
00:33:29

[another linear layer another rally ER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m31s)
00:33:31

[and then our final output with our final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m33s)
00:33:33

[activation function right and so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m36s)
00:33:36

[now a deep network so we could fit that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[and this time now because it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m50s)
00:33:50

[deeper I'm actually going to run a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m54s)
00:33:54

[more a pox right and you can see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h33m58s)
00:33:58

[accuracy increasing okay so if you try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m00s)
00:34:00

[and increase the learning rate here it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m03s)
00:34:03

[like 0.1 further it actually starts to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m05s)
00:34:05

[become unstable now I'll show you a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m11s)
00:34:11

[trick this is called learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[annealing and the trick is this when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m16s)
00:34:16

[you're trying to fit to a function right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m19s)
00:34:19

[you've been taking a few steps step step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m24s)
00:34:24

[step as you get close to the middle like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m29s)
00:34:29

[get close to the bottom your steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m32s)
00:34:32

[probably want to become smaller right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m34s)
00:34:34

[otherwise what tends to happen is you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m36s)
00:34:36

[start finding you're doing this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m38s)
00:34:38

[and so you can actually see it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m42s)
00:34:42

[right it got 93 94 and a bit 94 694](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m44s)
00:34:44

[eight like it's kind of starting to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m49s)
00:34:49

[flatten now right now that could be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m50s)
00:34:50

[because it's kind of done as well as it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m52s)
00:34:52

[can or it could be that it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m55s)
00:34:55

[growing backwards and forwards so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m57s)
00:34:57

[does a good idea as is later on in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h34m59s)
00:34:59

[training is to decrease your learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m02s)
00:35:02

[rate and to take smaller steps okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m04s)
00:35:04

[that's called learning rate annealing so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m07s)
00:35:07

[there's a function in fast AI called set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m09s)
00:35:09

[learning rates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m12s)
00:35:12

[you can pass in your optimizer and your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m13s)
00:35:13

[new learning rate and you don't see if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m15s)
00:35:15

[that helps right and very often it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m19s)
00:35:19

[about about an order of magnitude in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m25s)
00:35:25

[deep learning course we learn a much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m28s)
00:35:28

[much better technique than this to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m29s)
00:35:29

[this all automatically and at a more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m31s)
00:35:31

[granular level but if you're doing it by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m34s)
00:35:34

[hand you know like an order of magnitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m35s)
00:35:35

[at a time is what people generally do so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m38s)
00:35:38

[you'll see people in papers talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[learning rate schedules this is like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m45s)
00:35:45

[learning rate schedule so this schedule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m48s)
00:35:48

[just a moment Erica will come to us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m49s)
00:35:49

[first has got us 297 okay and I tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m52s)
00:35:52

[kind of going further and we don't seem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m56s)
00:35:56

[to be able to get much better than that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m58s)
00:35:58

[so yeah so here we've got something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[where we can get 97% accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m02s)
00:36:02

[yes Erica so it seems like you change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m05s)
00:36:05

[the learning rate to something very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m07s)
00:36:07

[small ten times smaller than we started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m10s)
00:36:10

[with so we had point one now its point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m13s)
00:36:13

[everyone yep but that makes the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m15s)
00:36:15

[model train really slow so I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m18s)
00:36:18

[wondering if you can make it so that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m20s)
00:36:20

[changes dynamically as it approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m21s)
00:36:21

[closer to the minimum yeah pretty much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m24s)
00:36:24

[yes so so that's some of the stuff we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m26s)
00:36:26

[learned in the deep planning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m28s)
00:36:28

[these more advanced approaches yep so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m29s)
00:36:29

[how it is different from using an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m34s)
00:36:34

[immobilizer or something that that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m36s)
00:36:36

[kind of stuff we can do I mean you still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m38s)
00:36:38

[need annealing as I say we do this kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m40s)
00:36:40

[of stuff in the deep learning course so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m42s)
00:36:42

[for now we're just going to stick to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m44s)
00:36:44

[standard SGD I had a question about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m45s)
00:36:45

[data loading yeah I know it's a fast day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m50s)
00:36:50

[i Function but could you go into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m53s)
00:36:53

[little bit detail of how it's creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m54s)
00:36:54

[batches how it's done and how it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m55s)
00:36:55

[making those decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m57s)
00:36:57

[sure I'd be good to ask that on Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h36m58s)
00:36:58

[night so we can talk about it in detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m05s)
00:37:05

[in the dig learning class but let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m07s)
00:37:07

[let's do the quick version here so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m09s)
00:37:09

[basically there's a really nice design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m12s)
00:37:12

[in PI torch where they basically say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m15s)
00:37:15

[let's let's create a thing called a data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m18s)
00:37:18

[set right and a data set is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m20s)
00:37:20

[something that looks like a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m24s)
00:37:24

[it has a length right and so that's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[how many images are in the data set and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m31s)
00:37:31

[it has the ability to index into it like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m34s)
00:37:34

[a list right so if you had like D equals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m38s)
00:37:38

[data set you can do length D and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m41s)
00:37:41

[do D or some index right that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m44s)
00:37:44

[basically all the data set is as far as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m46s)
00:37:46

[pipe torch is concerned and so you start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m49s)
00:37:49

[with the data set so it's like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m51s)
00:37:51

[d3 gives you the third image you know or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m54s)
00:37:54

[whatever and so then the idea is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h37m57s)
00:37:57

[you can take a data set and you can pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m00s)
00:38:00

[that into a constructor for a data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m02s)
00:38:02

[loader and that gives you something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m04s)
00:38:04

[which is now iterable right so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m13s)
00:38:13

[now say it a DL and that's something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m16s)
00:38:16

[that you can call next on and what that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[now is going to do is if when you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m24s)
00:38:24

[this you can choose to have shuffle on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m27s)
00:38:27

[or shuffle off shuffle on means give me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m29s)
00:38:29

[random mini-batch shuffle off means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m32s)
00:38:32

[drove through it sequentially and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m34s)
00:38:34

[what the data loader does now when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m38s)
00:38:38

[say next is it basically assuming you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m40s)
00:38:40

[said shuffle equals true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m42s)
00:38:42

[it's going to grab you know if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m44s)
00:38:44

[got a batch size of 64 64 random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m46s)
00:38:46

[integers between 0 and length and call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m49s)
00:38:49

[this 64 times to get 64 different items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m52s)
00:38:52

[and jam them together so fast AI uses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h38m56s)
00:38:56

[the exact same terminology and the exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m02s)
00:39:02

[same API we just do some of the details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m05s)
00:39:05

[differently so specifically particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m10s)
00:39:10

[with computer vision you often want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m12s)
00:39:12

[do a lot of pre pre processing data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m14s)
00:39:14

[augmentation like flipping changing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m18s)
00:39:18

[colors a little bit rotating those turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m20s)
00:39:20

[out to be really computationally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m22s)
00:39:22

[expensive even just reading the JPEGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m23s)
00:39:23

[turns out to be computationally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m26s)
00:39:26

[expensive so plate or chooses an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m27s)
00:39:27

[approach where it fires off multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m30s)
00:39:30

[processors to do that in parallel where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m31s)
00:39:31

[else the faster I librarian says does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m34s)
00:39:34

[something called multi-threading which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m36s)
00:39:36

[is a much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m38s)
00:39:38

[faster way of doing it yes you know so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m39s)
00:39:39

[mean pork is there really pork in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m47s)
00:39:47

[sense that all of the elements so it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m49s)
00:39:49

[shuffle at the beginning of the pork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m52s)
00:39:52

[something like that yeah yeah I mean not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m54s)
00:39:54

[all libraries work the same way some do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m56s)
00:39:56

[sampling with replacement some don't we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h39m58s)
00:39:58

[actually the first a a library hands off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m02s)
00:40:02

[the shuffling off to the set to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m05s)
00:40:05

[actual pipe torch version and I believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m08s)
00:40:08

[the pipes version yeah actually shuffles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m09s)
00:40:09

[and an epoch covers everything once I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m11s)
00:40:11

[believe okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m14s)
00:40:14

[now the thing is when you start to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m17s)
00:40:17

[these bigger networks potentially you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m23s)
00:40:23

[getting quite a few parameters right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m28s)
00:40:28

[I want to ask you to calculate how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m32s)
00:40:32

[parameters there are but let's let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m35s)
00:40:35

[remember here we've got 28 by 28 input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[into a hundred output and then a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m40s)
00:40:40

[into a hundred and then 100 into 10 all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m42s)
00:40:42

[right and then for each of those we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m45s)
00:40:45

[got weights and biases so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[actually do this net dot parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m49s)
00:40:49

[returns a list where each element of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m55s)
00:40:55

[list is a matrix or actually a tensor of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h40m59s)
00:40:59

[the parameters for that not just for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m02s)
00:41:02

[that layer but if it's a layer with both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m05s)
00:41:05

[weights and biases that would be two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m07s)
00:41:07

[parameters right so basically returns us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m08s)
00:41:08

[a list of all of the tensors containing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m10s)
00:41:10

[the the parameters some elements in pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m13s)
00:41:13

[torch tells you how how big that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m17s)
00:41:17

[right so if I run this here is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m20s)
00:41:20

[number of parameters in each layer so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m25s)
00:41:25

[I've got 784 inputs and the first layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m28s)
00:41:28

[has a hundred outputs so therefore the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m31s)
00:41:31

[first weight matrix is of size 78,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m34s)
00:41:34

[400 and the first bias vector is of size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m36s)
00:41:36

[100 okay and then the next one is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m40s)
00:41:40

[hundred by hundred okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m42s)
00:41:42

[and there's 100 and then the next one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[100 by 10 and then there's my bias okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m46s)
00:41:46

[so there's the number of elements in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m48s)
00:41:48

[each layer and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m51s)
00:41:51

[I add them all up it's nearly a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[thousand okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m54s)
00:41:54

[and so I'm possibly at risk of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m56s)
00:41:56

[overfitting yeah all right so we might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h41m58s)
00:41:58

[want to think about using regularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m03s)
00:42:03

[so a really simple common approach to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m04s)
00:42:04

[regularization in all of machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m08s)
00:42:08

[learning is something called l2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m10s)
00:42:10

[regularization and it's super important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[super handy you can use it with just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m21s)
00:42:21

[about anything right and the basic idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m23s)
00:42:23

[anyway so LT rotor ization the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m26s)
00:42:26

[idea is this normally we'd say our loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[is equal to let's just do our MSE to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m35s)
00:42:35

[keep things kind of simple it's equal to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m38s)
00:42:38

[our predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m40s)
00:42:40

[- our actuals you know squared and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m42s)
00:42:42

[we sum them up take the average take the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m45s)
00:42:45

[square root okay so what if we then want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m48s)
00:42:48

[to say you know what like if I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m53s)
00:42:53

[lots and lots of parameters don't use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m56s)
00:42:56

[them unless they're really helping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h42m59s)
00:42:59

[enough right like if you've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[million parameters and you only really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m03s)
00:43:03

[needed ten parameters to be useful just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m05s)
00:43:05

[use ten all right so how could we like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m07s)
00:43:07

[tell the loss function to do that and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[basically what we want to say is hey if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m13s)
00:43:13

[a parameter is zero that's no problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m16s)
00:43:16

[it's like it doesn't exist at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m19s)
00:43:19

[so let's penalize a parameter for not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m20s)
00:43:20

[being zero right so what would be a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[we could measure that how can we like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m28s)
00:43:28

[calculate how under Oh our parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m33s)
00:43:33

[are I can you pass that to Qin Shi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m37s)
00:43:37

[please Ernest you calculates the average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m42s)
00:43:42

[of positive parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m49s)
00:43:49

[can't quite be the average plus yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m51s)
00:43:51

[Taylor yeah yes you figured it out okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m54s)
00:43:54

[so I think if we like assuming all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h43m57s)
00:43:57

[our data has been normalized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m00s)
00:44:00

[standardized however you want to call it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m02s)
00:44:02

[we want to check that they're like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m03s)
00:44:03

[significantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[different from zero right not the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m06s)
00:44:06

[that the parameter is rather would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m08s)
00:44:08

[significantly and the parameters don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[have to be normalized or anything that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m12s)
00:44:12

[is calculated right yes a significantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[different from zero right I suppose I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m15s)
00:44:15

[just assuming that the data has been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m17s)
00:44:17

[normalized so that we can compare that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m19s)
00:44:19

[money oh yeah I thought of yeah right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m21s)
00:44:21

[and then those that are not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m23s)
00:44:23

[significantly different from zero we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m26s)
00:44:26

[provoke I just draw and I think Chen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m27s)
00:44:27

[she's going to tell us how to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m29s)
00:44:29

[you just figured it out right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m30s)
00:44:30

[the could do that that would be called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m31s)
00:44:31

[l1 which is great so l1 would be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m35s)
00:44:35

[absolute value of the weights average l2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m40s)
00:44:40

[is actually the sum yeah yeah exactly so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m45s)
00:44:45

[we just take this we can just we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m52s)
00:44:52

[even have to square root so we just take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m54s)
00:44:54

[the squares of the weights themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[and then like we want to be able to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m01s)
00:45:01

[how much do we want to penalize not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m04s)
00:45:04

[being zero right because if we actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m07s)
00:45:07

[don't have that many parameters we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m09s)
00:45:09

[want to regularize much at all if we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m11s)
00:45:11

[got heaps we do want to regularize a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m12s)
00:45:12

[right so then we put a parameter yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m14s)
00:45:14

[right except I have a role in my classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m20s)
00:45:20

[which is never to use Greek letters so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m22s)
00:45:22

[normally people use alpha I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m23s)
00:45:23

[use hey okay so so this is some number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m25s)
00:45:25

[which you often see something around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m30s)
00:45:30

[kind of 1e neg 6 to 1 enoch 4 ish right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m33s)
00:45:33

[now we actually don't care about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m41s)
00:45:41

[loss when you think about it we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m45s)
00:45:45

[actually care about the loss other--](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m49s)
00:45:49

[than like maybe to print it out or we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m50s)
00:45:50

[actually care about is the gradient of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m52s)
00:45:52

[the loss okay so the gradient of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h45m54s)
00:45:54

[right is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m01s)
00:46:01

[that right so there are two ways to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m05s)
00:46:05

[this we can actually modify our loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m10s)
00:46:10

[function to add in this square penalty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m11s)
00:46:11

[or we could modify that thing where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m16s)
00:46:16

[said weights equals weights minus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m20s)
00:46:20

[gradient times learning rate to subtract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m23s)
00:46:23

[that as well right actually to add that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m27s)
00:46:27

[as well and these are roughly these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m31s)
00:46:31

[kind of basically equivalent but they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m36s)
00:46:36

[have different names this is called l2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m37s)
00:46:37

[regularization right this is called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m39s)
00:46:39

[weight decay so in the neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m42s)
00:46:42

[literature you know that version kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m46s)
00:46:46

[was the how it was first posed in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[neural network literature where else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m52s)
00:46:52

[this other version is kind of how it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m54s)
00:46:54

[posed in the statistics literature and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m57s)
00:46:57

[yeah you know they're they're equivalent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h46m59s)
00:46:59

[as we talked about in the deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m03s)
00:47:03

[class it turns out they're not exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m05s)
00:47:05

[equivalent because when you have things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m07s)
00:47:07

[like momentum and atom it can behave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m09s)
00:47:09

[differently and two weeks ago a research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m11s)
00:47:11

[figured out a way to actually do proper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m14s)
00:47:14

[weight decay in modern optimizers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m18s)
00:47:18

[one of our first day students just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m20s)
00:47:20

[implemented that in the first day I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m22s)
00:47:22

[library so first a is now the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[library to actually support this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m26s)
00:47:26

[properly so anyways so for now let's do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m28s)
00:47:28

[the the version which applied torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m31s)
00:47:31

[calls weight decay but actually it turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m38s)
00:47:38

[out based on this paper two weeks ago is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m40s)
00:47:40

[actually l2 regularization it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m42s)
00:47:42

[quite correct but it's close enough so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m44s)
00:47:44

[here we can they weight decay as one in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m46s)
00:47:46

[x3 so it's going to set our constant our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m48s)
00:47:48

[penalty multiplier a21 in X 3 and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m51s)
00:47:51

[going to add that to the loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m55s)
00:47:55

[okay and so let's make a copy of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h47m57s)
00:47:57

[cells just so we can compare hope this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m00s)
00:48:00

[actually works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m04s)
00:48:04

[okay and we'll set this running okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m06s)
00:48:06

[because there's now optimizing well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m07s)
00:48:07

[except if you actually so I've made a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m11s)
00:48:11

[mistake here which is I didn't rerun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m15s)
00:48:15

[this cell this is an important thing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m17s)
00:48:17

[kind of remember since I didn't run this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m20s)
00:48:20

[rerun this cell here when it created the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m22s)
00:48:22

[optimizer and said net dot parameters it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m25s)
00:48:25

[started with the parameters that I had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m28s)
00:48:28

[already trained right so I actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m30s)
00:48:30

[hadn't recreated my network okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m31s)
00:48:31

[actually you go back and rerun this cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m34s)
00:48:34

[first to recreate the network then go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m36s)
00:48:36

[through and run this okay there we go so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m40s)
00:48:40

[let's see what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m48s)
00:48:48

[so you might notice them notice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m54s)
00:48:54

[something kind of kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m56s)
00:48:56

[counterintuitive here which is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h48m57s)
00:48:57

[that's our training error right now you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m02s)
00:49:02

[would expect our training error with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m05s)
00:49:05

[regularization to be worse that makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m07s)
00:49:07

[sense right because we're like we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m12s)
00:49:12

[penalizing parameters that specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m13s)
00:49:13

[can make it better and yet actually it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m17s)
00:49:17

[started out better not worse so why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m22s)
00:49:22

[could that be so the reason that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m25s)
00:49:25

[happen is that if you have a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m29s)
00:49:29

[that looks like that right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m32s)
00:49:32

[it takes potentially a really long time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m36s)
00:49:36

[to train where else if you have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m38s)
00:49:38

[function that kind of looks more like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m40s)
00:49:40

[that it's going to train a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m43s)
00:49:43

[quickly and there are certain things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m45s)
00:49:45

[that you can do which sometimes just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m47s)
00:49:47

[like can take a function that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m49s)
00:49:49

[horrible and make it less horrible and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m51s)
00:49:51

[it's sometimes weight decay you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[actually make your functions a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[more nicely behaved and that's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h49m58s)
00:49:58

[happened here so like I just mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m00s)
00:50:00

[that to say like don't let that confuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m02s)
00:50:02

[you right like white decay really does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[penalize the training set and look so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m07s)
00:50:07

[strictly speaking the final number we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m09s)
00:50:09

[get to for the training set shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m12s)
00:50:12

[end up be beat being better but it can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m14s)
00:50:14

[train sometimes more quickly all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m16s)
00:50:16

[yes can you pass it a chance you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[get it okay why making it faster like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m26s)
00:50:26

[Zee Time Matters like the training time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[memories no it's just after one epoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[right so after one epoch now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m35s)
00:50:35

[congratulations for saying I don't get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m45s)
00:50:45

[it that's like the best thing anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m47s)
00:50:47

[can say you know so hopeful this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[was our training without wait okay okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m54s)
00:50:54

[and this here is our training with wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h50m58s)
00:50:58

[okay okay so this is not really just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m01s)
00:51:01

[time this is related to just an epoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m05s)
00:51:05

[right after one Apoc my claim was that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m09s)
00:51:09

[you would expect the training set all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[other things being equal to have a worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m16s)
00:51:16

[loss with weight decay because we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[penalizing it you know this has no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m23s)
00:51:23

[penalty this has a penalty so the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m26s)
00:51:26

[with the penalty should be worse and I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m28s)
00:51:28

[saying oh it's not that's weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m31s)
00:51:31

[right and so the reason it's not is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m34s)
00:51:34

[because in a single epoch it matters a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m37s)
00:51:37

[lot as to whether you're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m41s)
00:51:41

[optimize something that's very bumpy or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m43s)
00:51:43

[whether you're trying to optimize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m45s)
00:51:45

[something that's kind of nice and smooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m46s)
00:51:46

[if you're trying to optimize something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m49s)
00:51:49

[that's really bumpy like imagine in some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m51s)
00:51:51

[high dimensional space right you end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m54s)
00:51:54

[kind of rolling around through all these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m57s)
00:51:57

[different tubes and tunnels and stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h51m59s)
00:51:59

[you know where else if it's just smooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m01s)
00:52:01

[you just go boom item it's like imagine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m03s)
00:52:03

[of marble rolling down a hill where one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m06s)
00:52:06

[of them you've got like it's a called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m09s)
00:52:09

[Lombard Street in San Francisco it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m11s)
00:52:11

[like backwards forwards backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m13s)
00:52:13

[forwards it takes a long time to drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m14s)
00:52:14

[down the road right where else you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m16s)
00:52:16

[if you kind of took a motorbike and just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m18s)
00:52:18

[went straight over the top you just make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m20s)
00:52:20

[sure boom right so so weather so kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m21s)
00:52:21

[the shape of the loss function surface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m26s)
00:52:26

[you know impacts or kind of defines how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m28s)
00:52:28

[easy it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m32s)
00:52:32

[optimized and therefore how far can it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m32s)
00:52:32

[get in a single epoch and based on these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m36s)
00:52:36

[results it would appear that weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m38s)
00:52:38

[decay here has made it this function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m40s)
00:52:40

[easier to optimize so just to make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m43s)
00:52:43

[it's the penalizing is making the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m46s)
00:52:46

[optimizer more than likely to reach the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m50s)
00:52:50

[global minimum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m53s)
00:52:53

[no I wouldn't say that my claim actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m54s)
00:52:54

[is that at the end it's probably going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h52m57s)
00:52:57

[to be less good on the training set and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m00s)
00:53:00

[indeed this does look to be the case at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m01s)
00:53:01

[the end after five epochs our training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m03s)
00:53:03

[set is now worse with weight decay now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m08s)
00:53:08

[that's what I would expect right I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[expect like if you actually find like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m13s)
00:53:13

[never used a term global optimum because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m15s)
00:53:15

[it's just not something we have any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m17s)
00:53:17

[guarantees about we don't really care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m20s)
00:53:20

[about or just care like where do we get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m21s)
00:53:21

[to after a certain number of epochs we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[hope that we found somewhere that's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m26s)
00:53:26

[a good solution and so by the time we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m27s)
00:53:27

[get to like a good solution the training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m29s)
00:53:29

[set with weight decay the loss is worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m32s)
00:53:32

[because it's very right but on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m34s)
00:53:34

[validation set the loss is better right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m39s)
00:53:39

[because we penalized the training set in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m42s)
00:53:42

[order to kind of try and create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m45s)
00:53:45

[something it generalizes better so we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m47s)
00:53:47

[got more parameter you know that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m49s)
00:53:49

[parameters that are kind of pointless in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m50s)
00:53:50

[l0 and it generalizes better right so so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m52s)
00:53:52

[all we're seeing is that it just got to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m55s)
00:53:55

[a good point after one epoch is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h53m59s)
00:53:59

[orbiting obviously no no I but if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m03s)
00:54:03

[buy if you mean just weight decay you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m10s)
00:54:10

[always make the function surface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m12s)
00:54:12

[smoother no it's not always true but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m13s)
00:54:13

[it's like it's worth remembering that if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m17s)
00:54:17

[you're having trouble training of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m22s)
00:54:22

[function adding a little bit of weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m24s)
00:54:24

[decay may may help what so by analyzing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m26s)
00:54:26

[the parameters what it does as its moons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m32s)
00:54:32

[out the loss function I mean it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m35s)
00:54:35

[it's not why we do it you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m38s)
00:54:38

[reason why we do it is because we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m40s)
00:54:40

[to penalize things that aren't zero to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m42s)
00:54:42

[say like don't make this per](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m44s)
00:54:44

[a high number unless it's really helping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m46s)
00:54:46

[the Lasser lodge right set it to 0 if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m48s)
00:54:48

[you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m51s)
00:54:51

[because setting as many parameters to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m51s)
00:54:51

[zero as possible means that it's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m53s)
00:54:53

[to generalize better right it's like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m55s)
00:54:55

[same as having a smaller network okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h54m57s)
00:54:57

[that's that's we do that's why we do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m01s)
00:55:01

[but it can change how it learns as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m03s)
00:55:03

[so let's okay this one moment okay so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m08s)
00:55:08

[just wanted to check how we actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m11s)
00:55:11

[went here so after the second epoch yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m12s)
00:55:12

[so you can see here it's really has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m14s)
00:55:14

[helped right after the second epoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m16s)
00:55:16

[before we got to 97% accuracy now we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m19s)
00:55:19

[nearly up to about 98% accuracy right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m21s)
00:55:21

[and you can see that the loss was 0.08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m24s)
00:55:24

[versus 0.13 right so adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m28s)
00:55:28

[regularization has allowed us to find a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m30s)
00:55:30

[you know three percent versus two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m33s)
00:55:33

[percent so like a fifty percent better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m36s)
00:55:36

[solution yes Erica so there are two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m39s)
00:55:39

[pieces to this right what is l2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m43s)
00:55:43

[regularization and the way to key know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m45s)
00:55:45

[they're the same so my claim was they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m48s)
00:55:48

[the same thing right so white decay is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[the version if you just take the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[derivative of LT regularization you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m54s)
00:55:54

[weight decay so you can implement it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h55m57s)
00:55:57

[either by changing the loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m00s)
00:56:00

[with an with a squared loss penalty or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m01s)
00:56:01

[you can implement it by adding the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m04s)
00:56:04

[weights themselves as part of the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m08s)
00:56:08

[gradient okay yeah it's just gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m10s)
00:56:10

[finish the questions yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m14s)
00:56:14

[okay pass it to division can we use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m15s)
00:56:15

[regularization convolution absolutely so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m20s)
00:56:20

[a compilation layer just is is White's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m24s)
00:56:24

[aim Jeremy can you explain why you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m28s)
00:56:28

[thought you needed weight decay in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m31s)
00:56:31

[particular problem not easily I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m33s)
00:56:33

[other than to say it's something that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m38s)
00:56:38

[would always try speaking well yeah I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m39s)
00:56:39

[mean okay so even if I yeah okay that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m43s)
00:56:43

[a good point unit so if if my training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m50s)
00:56:50

[loss was higher than my validation loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m55s)
00:56:55

[then I'm under fitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h56m58s)
00:56:58

[right so there's definitely no point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m00s)
00:57:00

[recognizing right if like that would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m02s)
00:57:02

[always be a bad thing that would always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m05s)
00:57:05

[mean you need like more parameters in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m07s)
00:57:07

[your model in this case I'm I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m09s)
00:57:09

[overfitting that doesn't necessarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m13s)
00:57:13

[mean regularization will help but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m14s)
00:57:14

[certainly worth trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m17s)
00:57:17

[thank you you know that's a great point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[there's one more question yep Tyler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m20s)
00:57:20

[doing a pass over there so how do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m23s)
00:57:23

[choose the optimal number of epic you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m28s)
00:57:28

[my take learning cause it's a it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m35s)
00:57:35

[that's a long story and a lot to lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m39s)
00:57:39

[users by here on here ollie it's a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m41s)
00:57:41

[of both we just don't as I say we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m47s)
00:57:47

[have time to cover best practices in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[this class we're going to learn the kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[of fundamentals yeah okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m54s)
00:57:54

[so let's take a six minute break and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h57m56s)
00:57:56

[come back at 11:10 alright so something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m00s)
00:58:00

[that we cover in great detail in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m15s)
00:58:15

[deep learning course but it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m17s)
00:58:17

[really important to mention here is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m18s)
00:58:18

[is it the secret in my opinion to kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m20s)
00:58:20

[of modern machine learning techniques is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m23s)
00:58:23

[to massively over parameterize the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m25s)
00:58:25

[solution to your problem right like as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m29s)
00:58:29

[we've done here you know we've got like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m31s)
00:58:31

[a hundred thousand weights when we only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m33s)
00:58:33

[had a small number of 28 by 28 images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m36s)
00:58:36

[and then use regularization okay it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m38s)
00:58:38

[like the direct opposite of how nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m42s)
00:58:42

[all statistics and learning was done for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[decades before and still most kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m52s)
00:58:52

[like senior lecturers at most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m55s)
00:58:55

[universities in most areas of have this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h58m57s)
00:58:57

[background where they've learned the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m00s)
00:59:00

[correct way to build a model is to like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m01s)
00:59:01

[have as few parameters as possible right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m03s)
00:59:03

[and so hopefully we've learnt two things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m06s)
00:59:06

[so far you know one is we can build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[very accurate models even when they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m13s)
00:59:13

[lots and lots of parameters like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m16s)
00:59:16

[random forest has a lot of parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m17s)
00:59:17

[and you know this here deep network has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[a lot of parameters and they can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m23s)
00:59:23

[accurate right and we can do that by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m24s)
00:59:24

[either using bagging or by using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[regularization okay and regularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m32s)
00:59:32

[in neural nets means either weight decay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[also known as kind of filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m39s)
00:59:39

[regularization or drop out which we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m41s)
00:59:41

[won't worry too much about yeah so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m44s)
00:59:44

[it's a it's a very different way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m49s)
00:59:49

[thinking about building useful models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m52s)
00:59:52

[and like I just wanted to kind of warn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m56s)
00:59:56

[you that once you leave this classroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=00h59m59s)
00:59:59

[like even possibly when you go to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m01s)
01:00:01

[next faculty members talk like there'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m04s)
01:00:04

[be people at USF as well who entirely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m06s)
01:00:06

[trained in the world of like models with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m10s)
01:00:10

[small numbers of parameters you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m14s)
01:00:14

[your next boss is very likely to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m15s)
01:00:15

[been trained in the world of models with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m17s)
01:00:17

[small numbers of parameters the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m19s)
01:00:19

[that they are somehow more pure or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m22s)
01:00:22

[easier or better or more interpretable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m25s)
01:00:25

[or whatever I I am convinced that that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m27s)
01:00:27

[is not true probably not ever true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m33s)
01:00:33

[certainly very rarely true and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m36s)
01:00:36

[actually models with lots of parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m41s)
01:00:41

[can be extremely interpretive all as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m46s)
01:00:46

[learn from our whole lesson of random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m48s)
01:00:48

[forest interpretation you can use most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m50s)
01:00:50

[of the same techniques with neural nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m53s)
01:00:53

[but with neural nets are even easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m55s)
01:00:55

[right remember how we did feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m56s)
01:00:56

[importance by randomizing a column to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h00m58s)
01:00:58

[see how it changes in that column would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m02s)
01:01:02

[impact the output well that's just like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m04s)
01:01:04

[a kind of dumb way of calculating its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m06s)
01:01:06

[gradient how much does varying this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m09s)
01:01:09

[import change the output with a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m11s)
01:01:11

[net we can actually calculate its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m13s)
01:01:13

[gradient right so with PI torch you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m15s)
01:01:15

[actually say what's the gradient that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m17s)
01:01:17

[the output with respect to this column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m19s)
01:01:19

[okay you can do the same kind of thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m21s)
01:01:21

[these things for neural nets right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m35s)

[but only in very narrow domains like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m46s)

01:01:56

[a really exciting big area so what we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h01m59s)

[going to do though is we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h02m06s)

[going to look at a situation where a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h02m38s)

[linear model is pretty close to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h02m41s)
01:02:41

[state of the art for solving a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h02m45s)

[particular problem it's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h02m46s)
01:02:46

[something where I actually surpassed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h02m48s)

[show you pretty close to the state of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h02m59s)

[I am DVD data set so this is a data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m06s)

[of movie reviews you can download it by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[following these steps and once you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m12s)
01:03:12

[download it you'll see that you've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m18s)
01:03:18

[train and a test directory and in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[train directory you'll see there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m26s)
01:03:26

[negative and a positive directory and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m28s)
01:03:28

[your positive directory you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m31s)
01:03:31

[there's a bunch of text files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m33s)
01:03:33

[and here's an example of a text file so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m37s)
01:03:37

[somehow we've managed to pick out a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m40s)

[story of a man who has a natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m42s)

[that wasn't intentional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[but it'll be fun so we're going to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[at these movie reviews and for each one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m54s)
01:03:54

[we're going to look to see whether they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m57s)
01:03:57

[were positive or negative so they've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h03m59s)
01:03:59

[been put into one of these folders they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m00s)
01:04:00

[were downloaded from from IMDB the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m02s)
01:04:02

[database and review site the ones that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m05s)
01:04:05

[were strongly positive went positive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m08s)
01:04:08

[strongly negative went negative and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m10s)
01:04:10

[rest they didn't label at all so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m13s)
01:04:13

[only highly polarized reviews so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m14s)
01:04:14

[case you know we have an insane violent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m17s)
01:04:17

[mob which unfortunately it is too absurd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m20s)
01:04:20

[too off-putting those in the area be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m23s)
01:04:23

[turned off so the label for this was a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m26s)
01:04:26

[zero which is negative okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m30s)
01:04:30

[so this is a negative review so in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m34s)
01:04:34

[FASTA guy library there's lots of little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m39s)

[functions and classes to help with most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m41s)
01:04:41

[learning on for NLP one of the simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m47s)
01:04:47

[things we have is texts from folders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m50s)
01:04:50

[there's just going to go ahead and go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m51s)
01:04:51

[through and find all of the folders in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m53s)
01:04:53

[here with these names and create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m55s)
01:04:55

[labeled data set and you know don't let](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h04m59s)
01:04:59

[these things ever stop you from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m03s)
01:05:03

[understanding what's going on behind the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m05s)
01:05:05

[scenes okay we can grab its source code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m07s)
01:05:07

[and as you can see it's tiny you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m10s)
01:05:10

[it's like five lines okay so I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m12s)
01:05:12

[like to write these things out in full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m14s)
01:05:14

[you know but hide them behind at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m16s)
01:05:16

[functions so you can reuse them but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m18s)
01:05:18

[basically it's going to go through each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m20s)
01:05:20

[directory and then within that so I go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m21s)
01:05:21

[through yeah go through each directory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m23s)
01:05:23

[and then go through each file in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m27s)
01:05:27

[directory and then stick that into this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[array of texts and figure out what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m35s)
01:05:35

[folder it's in and stick that into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m38s)
01:05:38

[array of labels okay so that's how we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m39s)
01:05:39

[basically end up with something where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m44s)
01:05:44

[have an array of the reviews and an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m46s)
01:05:46

[array of the labels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m49s)
01:05:49

[okay so that's our data so our job will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[be to take that and to predict that okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h05m53s)
01:05:53

[and the way we're going to do it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m00s)
01:06:00

[we're gonna throw away like all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m03s)
01:06:03

[interesting stuff about language which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m06s)
01:06:06

[is the order in which the words are in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m09s)
01:06:09

[right now this is very often not a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m11s)
01:06:11

[idea but in this particular case it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m14s)
01:06:14

[going to turn out to work like not too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m17s)
01:06:17

[badly so let me show you what I mean by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m18s)
01:06:18

[like throwing away the order of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m20s)
01:06:20

[words like normally the order of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m22s)
01:06:22

[words matters a lot if you've got a not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m23s)
01:06:23

[before something then that not refers to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m26s)
01:06:26

[that thing right so but the thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m29s)
01:06:29

[when in this case we're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m31s)
01:06:31

[predict whether something is positive or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m33s)
01:06:33

[negative if you see the word absurd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[appear a lot right then maybe that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[sign that this isn't very good so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m40s)
01:06:40

[know cryptic maybe there's a sign that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m45s)
01:06:45

[it's not very good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m47s)
01:06:47

[so the idea is that we're going to turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m48s)
01:06:48

[it into something called a term document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m50s)
01:06:50

[matrix where for each document are you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m53s)
01:06:53

[each review we're just going to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m56s)
01:06:56

[list of what words are in it rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h06m57s)
01:06:57

[what order they're in so let me give an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m00s)
01:07:00

[example can you see this okay okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m01s)
01:07:01

[here are four movie reviews that I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m07s)
01:07:07

[up this movie is good the movie is good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m11s)
01:07:11

[they're both positive this movie is bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m15s)
01:07:15

[the movie is bad they're both negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m17s)
01:07:17

[right so I'm going to turn this into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m19s)
01:07:19

[term document matrix so the first thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m22s)
01:07:22

[I need to do is create some in-court of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m24s)
01:07:24

[vocabulary a vocabulary is a list of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m25s)
01:07:25

[the unique words that appear okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m28s)
01:07:28

[here's my vocabulary this movie is good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m31s)
01:07:31

[the bad that's all the words okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m33s)
01:07:33

[now I'm going to take each one of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m37s)
01:07:37

[movie reviews and turn it into a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m38s)
01:07:38

[of which words appear and how often do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[they appear right and in this case none](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m44s)
01:07:44

[of my words appear twice so this movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m46s)
01:07:46

[is good has those four words in it where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[else this movie is bad has those four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m53s)
01:07:53

[words in it okay so this is called a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h07m56s)
01:07:56

[term document matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m02s)
01:08:02

[alright and this representation we call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m04s)
01:08:04

[a bag of words representation right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m06s)
01:08:06

[this here is a bag of words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m10s)
01:08:10

[representation of the view of the review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m11s)
01:08:11

[it doesn't contain the order of the text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m13s)
01:08:13

[anymore it's just a bag of the words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m16s)
01:08:16

[what words are in it it contains bad is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m19s)
01:08:19

[movie this okay so that's the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m22s)
01:08:22

[thing we're going to do is we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m25s)
01:08:25

[to turn it into a bag of words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[representation and the reason that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m27s)
01:08:27

[is convenient for linear models is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m29s)
01:08:29

[this is a nice rectangular matrix that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m33s)
01:08:33

[we can like do math on okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m37s)
01:08:37

[specifically we can do a logistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m40s)
01:08:40

[regression and that's what we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m42s)
01:08:42

[to do is we're going to get to a point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m43s)
01:08:43

[we do a logistic regression before we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m44s)
01:08:44

[get there though we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m47s)
01:08:47

[something else which is called naive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m48s)
01:08:48

[Bayes okay so SK learn has something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m49s)
01:08:49

[which will create a term document matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m55s)
01:08:55

[for us it's called count vectorizer okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h08m57s)
01:08:57

[so what does use it now in NLP you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m00s)
01:09:00

[to turn your text into a list of words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m05s)
01:09:05

[and that's called tokenization okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m08s)
01:09:08

[that's actually non-trivial because like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m12s)
01:09:12

[if this was actually this movie is good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m15s)
01:09:15

[dot right or if it was this movie is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m17s)
01:09:17

[good like how do you deal with like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m23s)
01:09:23

[punctuation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m27s)
01:09:27

[well perhaps more interestingly what if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m29s)
01:09:29

[it was this movie isn't good alright so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m31s)
01:09:31

[how you turn a piece of text into a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m35s)
01:09:35

[of tokens is called tokenization right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m39s)
01:09:39

[and so a good tokenizer would turn this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m41s)
01:09:41

[movie isn't good into this this base](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m44s)
01:09:44

[quote movie space is space and good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[space right so you can see in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m53s)
01:09:53

[version here if I now split this on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m56s)
01:09:56

[spaces every token is either a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h09m58s)
01:09:58

[piece of punctuation or like this suffix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m01s)
01:10:01

[and is considered like a word right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m04s)
01:10:04

[that's kind of like how we would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m06s)
01:10:06

[probably want to tokenize that piece of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m08s)
01:10:08

[text because you wouldn't want good . to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m10s)
01:10:10

[be like an object right because there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m14s)
01:10:14

[no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m17s)
01:10:17

[concept of good . right or double-quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m17s)
01:10:17

[movie is not like an object right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[tokenization is something we hand off to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m24s)
01:10:24

[a tokenizer first AI has a tokenizer in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m27s)
01:10:27

[it that we can use so this is how we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m30s)
01:10:30

[create our term document matrix with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m34s)
01:10:34

[tokenizer s Kaitlyn has a pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m36s)
01:10:36

[standard API which is nice I'm sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m44s)
01:10:44

[you've seen it a few times now before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m46s)
01:10:46

[so once we've built some kind of model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m49s)
01:10:49

[think we can kind of think of this as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m52s)
01:10:52

[model just ish this is just defining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m53s)
01:10:53

[what it's going to do but you can call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m57s)
01:10:57

[fit transform - to do that right so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h10m59s)
01:10:59

[this case fit transform is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m03s)
01:11:03

[create the vocabulary okay and create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m05s)
01:11:05

[the term document matrix based on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m08s)
01:11:08

[training set transform is a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m10s)
01:11:10

[different that says use the previously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[fitted model which in this case means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m17s)
01:11:17

[use the previously created vocabulary we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[wouldn't want the validation set in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m22s)
01:11:22

[training set to have you know the words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m23s)
01:11:23

[in different orders in the matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m25s)
01:11:25

[right because then they'd like to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m27s)
01:11:27

[different meanings so this is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m28s)
01:11:28

[saying use the same vocabulary to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m30s)
01:11:30

[a bag of words for the validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m33s)
01:11:33

[could you pass that back in please what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m36s)
01:11:36

[if the violation set has different set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m41s)
01:11:41

[of words other than training yeah that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m43s)
01:11:43

[a great question so generally most of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m45s)
01:11:45

[these kind of vocab creating approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m48s)
01:11:48

[will have a special token for unknown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m50s)
01:11:50

[sometimes you can you'll also say like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m54s)
01:11:54

[hey if a word appears less than three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m57s)
01:11:57

[times call it unknown but otherwise it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h11m59s)
01:11:59

[like if you see something you haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m01s)
01:12:01

[seen before call it unknown so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m03s)
01:12:03

[would just become a column in the bag of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[words is good question all right so when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m07s)
01:12:07

[we create this term document matrix the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m14s)
01:12:14

[training set we have 25,000 rows because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m17s)
01:12:17

[there are 25,000 movie reviews and there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m19s)
01:12:19

[are 70 5132 columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m23s)
01:12:23

[what does that represent what does that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m25s)
01:12:25

[mean there are seven hundred and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m27s)
01:12:27

[seventy-five thousand hundred thirty-two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m28s)
01:12:28

[what can you pass that to device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[just a moment okay power sector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m31s)
01:12:31

[diversion locality yeah come on what do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m33s)
01:12:33

[you mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m38s)
01:12:38

[so like the number of words Union or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m39s)
01:12:39

[number of words that the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m42s)
01:12:42

[unique words yeah exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m44s)
01:12:44

[good okay now most documents don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m45s)
01:12:45

[most of these 75,000 words right so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m52s)
01:12:52

[don't want to actually store that as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m57s)
01:12:57

[normal array in memory because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h12m59s)
01:12:59

[going to be very wasteful so instead we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m02s)
01:13:02

[store it as a sparse matrix okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m05s)
01:13:05

[what a sparse matrix does is it just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m09s)
01:13:09

[stores it as something that says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m11s)
01:13:11

[whereabouts of the non-zeros right so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m16s)
01:13:16

[says like okay term number so document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m19s)
01:13:19

[number one word number four appears and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m22s)
01:13:22

[it has four of them you know document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m26s)
01:13:26

[one term number 123 has that that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m30s)
01:13:30

[appears and it's a one right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m36s)
01:13:36

[forth that's basically how it's done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m38s)
01:13:38

[there's actually a number of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m40s)
01:13:40

[ways of storing and if you do Rachel's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m42s)
01:13:42

[computational linear algebra course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m45s)
01:13:45

[you'll learn about the different types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[and why you choose them and how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m48s)
01:13:48

[convert and so forth but they're all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m50s)
01:13:50

[kind of something like this right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m52s)
01:13:52

[you don't really on the whole have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m54s)
01:13:54

[worry about the details the important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m56s)
01:13:56

[thing to know is it's it's efficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h13m59s)
01:13:59

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m01s)
01:14:01

[and so we could grab the first review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[all right and that gives us 75,000 long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m05s)
01:14:05

[sparse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m09s)
01:14:09

[one long one row long matrix okay with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m10s)
01:14:10

[93 stored elements so in other words 93](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m14s)
01:14:14

[of those words are actually used in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m18s)
01:14:18

[first document okay we can have a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m21s)
01:14:21

[at the vocabulary by saying vectorizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m24s)
01:14:24

[docket fetcher feature names that gives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m26s)
01:14:26

[us the vocab and so here's an example of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m28s)
01:14:28

[a few of the elements of feature names I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m31s)
01:14:31

[didn't intentionally pick the one that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m36s)
01:14:36

[had Ozzie but you know that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m38s)
01:14:38

[important words obviously I haven't you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m40s)
01:14:40

[the tokenizer here I'm just bidding on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m44s)
01:14:44

[space so this isn't quite the same as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m46s)
01:14:46

[what the vectorizer did but to simplify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m48s)
01:14:48

[things let's grab a set of all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m51s)
01:14:51

[lowercased words by making it a set we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m54s)
01:14:54

[make them unique so this is roughly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h14m57s)
01:14:57

[list of words that would appear right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m01s)
01:15:01

[and that length is 91 which is pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m03s)
01:15:03

[similar to 93 and just the difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m06s)
01:15:06

[will be that I didn't use a real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m07s)
01:15:07

[tokenizer yeah right so that's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m09s)
01:15:09

[all that's been done there it's probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m15s)
01:15:15

[created this unique list of words and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m16s)
01:15:16

[mapped them we could check by calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m19s)
01:15:19

[vectorizer cavalry underscore to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m23s)
01:15:23

[the ID of a particular word so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m25s)
01:15:25

[like the reverse map of this one right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m27s)
01:15:27

[this is like integer two word here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m30s)
01:15:30

[word two integer and so we saw absurd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m33s)
01:15:33

[appeared twice in the first document so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m36s)
01:15:36

[let's check train term dark zero comma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m38s)
01:15:38

[one two nine seven there it is is two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m40s)
01:15:40

[right or else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m42s)
01:15:42

[unfortunately Ozzie didn't appear in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m44s)
01:15:44

[unnatural relationship with a pig movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m47s)
01:15:47

[so zero comma five thousand is zero okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m50s)
01:15:50

[so that's that's our term document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[matrix yes so does it care about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h15m58s)
01:15:58

[relative relationship between the words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m04s)
01:16:04

[as in the ordering of the words no we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[thrown away the orderings that's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m10s)
01:16:10

[it's a bag of words and I'm not claiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m11s)
01:16:11

[that this is like necessarily a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m15s)
01:16:15

[idea what I will say is that like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m18s)
01:16:18

[vast majority of NLP work that's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m22s)
01:16:22

[done over the last few decades generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m24s)
01:16:24

[uses this representation because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m26s)
01:16:26

[didn't really know much better nowadays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[increasingly we're using recurrent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m31s)
01:16:31

[neural networks instead which we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m33s)
01:16:33

[learn about in our last deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m34s)
01:16:34

[lesson of part one but sometimes this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m38s)
01:16:38

[representation works pretty well and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m42s)
01:16:42

[it's actually going to work pretty well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m44s)
01:16:44

[in this case okay so in fact you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m45s)
01:16:45

[most like back when I was at first me or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m51s)
01:16:51

[my email company a lot of the spam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m54s)
01:16:54

[filtering we did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[used this next technique naivebayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h16m58s)
01:16:58

[which is as a bag of words approach just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m00s)
01:17:00

[kind of like you know if you're getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m03s)
01:17:03

[a lot of email containing the word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m04s)
01:17:04

[viagra and it's always been a spam and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m07s)
01:17:07

[you never get email from your friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m10s)
01:17:10

[talking about viagra then it's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m12s)
01:17:12

[likely something that says by Agra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m14s)
01:17:14

[regardless of the detail of the language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m16s)
01:17:16

[is probably from a spammer all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m18s)
01:17:18

[that's the basic theory about like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[classification using a term document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m22s)
01:17:22

[matrix okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m24s)
01:17:24

[so let's talk about naive Bayes and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m26s)
01:17:26

[here's the basic idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m30s)
01:17:30

[we're going to start with our term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m31s)
01:17:31

[document matrix right and these first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m33s)
01:17:33

[two is our corpus of positive reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[these next two is our corpus of negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m41s)
01:17:41

[reviews and so here's our whole corpus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m44s)
01:17:44

[of all reviews so what I could do is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m47s)
01:17:47

[to create a probability I've got to call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m51s)
01:17:51

[the as we tend to call these more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[generically features rather than words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h17m58s)
01:17:58

[right this is a feature movie as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m00s)
01:18:00

[feature is as a feature right so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m02s)
01:18:02

[kind of more now like machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m05s)
01:18:05

[language a column is a feature look all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m06s)
01:18:06

[those we call those earth in naive Bayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m09s)
01:18:09

[so we can basically say the probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m12s)
01:18:12

[that you would see the word this given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m15s)
01:18:15

[that the class is 1 given that it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m19s)
01:18:19

[positive review is just the average of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m22s)
01:18:22

[how often do you see this in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m25s)
01:18:25

[positive reviews right now we've got to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m28s)
01:18:28

[be a bit careful though because if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m32s)
01:18:32

[never ever see a particular word in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m37s)
01:18:37

[particular class right so if I've never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m41s)
01:18:41

[received an email from a friend that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m43s)
01:18:43

[said viagra right that doesn't actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m45s)
01:18:45

[mean the probability of a friend send me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m48s)
01:18:48

[sending me an email about viagra is zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m51s)
01:18:51

[it's not really zero right I I hope I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m53s)
01:18:53

[don't get an email you know from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m58s)
01:18:58

[Terrence tomorrow saying like Jeremy you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h18m59s)
01:18:59

[probably could use this you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m02s)
01:19:02

[effortless meant for viagra but you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m04s)
01:19:04

[it could happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m06s)
01:19:06

[you know I'm sure it'd be in my best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m08s)
01:19:08

[interest yeah so so what we do is we say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m11s)
01:19:11

[actually what we've seen so far is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m15s)
01:19:15

[the full sample of everything that could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m18s)
01:19:18

[happen it's like a sample of what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m19s)
01:19:19

[happened so far so let's assume that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m21s)
01:19:21

[next email you get actually does mention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m24s)
01:19:24

[viagra and every other possible word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m27s)
01:19:27

[right so basically we're going to add a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m29s)
01:19:29

[row of ones okay so that's like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m32s)
01:19:32

[email that contains every possible word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m37s)
01:19:37

[so that way nothing's ever infinitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m38s)
01:19:38

[and unlikely yeah so I take the average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m41s)
01:19:41

[of all of the times that this appears in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m44s)
01:19:44

[my positive corpus plus the ones okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m49s)
01:19:49

[so that's like the the probability that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h19m54s)
01:19:54

[feature equals this appears in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[document given that class equals one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m04s)
01:20:04

[so not surprisingly here's the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m08s)
01:20:08

[thing for probability that this feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m10s)
01:20:10

[this appears given class equals zero all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m12s)
01:20:12

[right same calculation except for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[zero rows and obviously these are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m17s)
01:20:17

[same because this appears twice in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[positives sorry once in the positives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m25s)
01:20:25

[and once in the negatives okay let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m27s)
01:20:27

[just put this back to what it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m31s)
01:20:31

[all right so we can do that for every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m39s)
01:20:39

[feature for every class right so our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m44s)
01:20:44

[trick now is to basically use Bayes rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m50s)
01:20:50

[to kind of fill this in so what we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h20m55s)
01:20:55

[is the probability that given that I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m02s)
01:21:02

[got this particular document so somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m08s)
01:21:08

[sent me this particular email or I have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m10s)
01:21:10

[this particular IMDB review what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m12s)
01:21:12

[probability that its class is equal to I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m15s)
01:21:15

[don't know positive right so for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m20s)
01:21:20

[particular movie review what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m23s)
01:21:23

[probability that it's plus is positive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m24s)
01:21:24

[right and so we can say well that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m27s)
01:21:27

[equal to the probability that we got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m29s)
01:21:29

[this particular movie review given that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m34s)
01:21:34

[its class is positive multiplied by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m39s)
01:21:39

[probability that any movie reviews plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m43s)
01:21:43

[is positive divided by the probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m46s)
01:21:46

[of getting this particular movie review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m49s)
01:21:49

[all right that's just basis rule okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m52s)
01:21:52

[and so we can calculate all of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m55s)
01:21:55

[things but actually what we really want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h21m59s)
01:21:59

[to know is is it more likely that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m02s)
01:22:02

[is plus 0 or plus 1 right so what if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m05s)
01:22:05

[actually took probability that's plus 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m09s)
01:22:09

[and divided by probability that's plus 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[what if we did that right and so then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m16s)
01:22:16

[could say like okay if this number is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m20s)
01:22:20

[bigger than 1 that it's more likely to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m22s)
01:22:22

[be class 1 if it's smaller than 1 it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m24s)
01:22:24

[more likely to be class 0 right so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m27s)
01:22:27

[that case we could just divide this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m29s)
01:22:29

[whole thing right by the same version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m33s)
01:22:33

[for class 0 right which is the same as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m37s)
01:22:37

[multiplying it by the reciprocal and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m40s)
01:22:40

[the nice thing is now that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m42s)
01:22:42

[put a probability D on top here which we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m43s)
01:22:43

[can get rid of right and a probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m46s)
01:22:46

[of getting the data given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m49s)
01:22:49

[zero down here and the probability of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m52s)
01:22:52

[getting class zero here right and so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m54s)
01:22:54

[we basically what that means is we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h22m59s)
01:22:59

[to calculate the probability that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m02s)
01:23:02

[would get this particular document given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m04s)
01:23:04

[that the class is 1 times the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m07s)
01:23:07

[probability that the class is 1 divided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[by the probability of getting this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m12s)
01:23:12

[particular document given the classes to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m13s)
01:23:13

[0 times the probability that the class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m15s)
01:23:15

[is 0 so the probability that the class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m18s)
01:23:18

[is 1 is just equal to the average of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m21s)
01:23:21

[labels write probability the class is 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m26s)
01:23:26

[is just 1 minus that right so so there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m30s)
01:23:30

[are those two numbers right I've got an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m37s)
01:23:37

[equal amount of both so it's both 0.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m39s)
01:23:39

[what is the probability of getting this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m43s)
01:23:43

[document given that the class is 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m45s)
01:23:45

[can anybody tell me how I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m49s)
01:23:49

[calculate that can somebody pass that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h23m51s)
01:23:51

[remember so it's going to be for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m09s)
01:24:09

[particular document so for example would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m11s)
01:24:11

[be saying like what's the probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m13s)
01:24:13

[that this review is positive all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m14s)
01:24:14

[so what so you're on the right track but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m18s)
01:24:18

[what we have to gonna have to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m20s)
01:24:20

[going to have to say let's just look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[the words it has and then multiply the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m23s)
01:24:23

[probabilities together for class equals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m28s)
01:24:28

[1 right so the probability that a class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m32s)
01:24:32

[1 review has this is 2/3 the probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m37s)
01:24:37

[it has movie is one is is 1 and good is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m43s)
01:24:43

[1 so the probability it has all of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m47s)
01:24:47

[is all of those multiplied together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m50s)
01:24:50

[kinda and the kinder phyla why is it not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m52s)
01:24:52

[really can you press it in Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h24m56s)
01:24:56

[so glad you look horrified and skeptical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m02s)
01:25:02

[where choices not independence thank you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m05s)
01:25:05

[so nobody can call Tyler naive because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m09s)
01:25:09

[the reason this is naive Bayes is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m13s)
01:25:13

[because this is what happens if you take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m16s)
01:25:16

[bayes's theorem Xander naive why and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m18s)
01:25:18

[Tyler is not naive anything better right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m20s)
01:25:20

[so naive Bayes says let's assume that if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m23s)
01:25:23

[you have this movie is bloody stupid I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m26s)
01:25:26

[hate it but the probability of hate is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m29s)
01:25:29

[independent of the probability of bloody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m32s)
01:25:32

[is an independent of the probability of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m34s)
01:25:34

[stupid right which is definitely not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m36s)
01:25:36

[true right and so naive Bayes ain't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m38s)
01:25:38

[actually very good but I'm kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m40s)
01:25:40

[teaching it to you because it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m42s)
01:25:42

[turn out to be a convenient piece for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m44s)
01:25:44

[something we're about to learn later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m48s)
01:25:48

[it's okay right I mean it's it's it's I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m50s)
01:25:50

[would never I would never choose it like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m53s)
01:25:53

[I don't think it's better than any other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m56s)
01:25:56

[technique that's equally fast and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m57s)
01:25:57

[equally easy but you know it's the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h25m59s)
01:25:59

[you can do and it's certainly going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m02s)
01:26:02

[be a useful foundation so so here is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m04s)
01:26:04

[calculation right of the probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m09s)
01:26:09

[that this document is that we get this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m12s)
01:26:12

[particular document assuming it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m16s)
01:26:16

[positive review here's the probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m18s)
01:26:18

[given us a negative and here's the ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m20s)
01:26:20

[and this ratio is above one so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m23s)
01:26:23

[going to say I think that this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m26s)
01:26:26

[probably a positive review okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m27s)
01:26:27

[that's the Excel version and so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m30s)
01:26:30

[tell that I let your net touch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m35s)
01:26:35

[because it's got latex in it we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m37s)
01:26:37

[actual math so so here is the here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[the same thing the log count ratio of H](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m42s)
01:26:42

[feature FH would if and so here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m46s)
01:26:46

[written out as Python okay so our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m52s)
01:26:52

[independent variable is our term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m56s)
01:26:56

[document matrix a dependent variable is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h26m57s)
01:26:57

[just the labels of the way so using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m00s)
01:27:00

[numpy this is going to grab the rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m03s)
01:27:03

[where the dependent variable is one okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m06s)
01:27:06

[and so then we can sum them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m10s)
01:27:10

[over the rows to get the total word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m13s)
01:27:13

[count for that feature across all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m16s)
01:27:16

[documents right plus one all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m19s)
01:27:19

[because that's the email Terrance is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m22s)
01:27:22

[totally going to send me something about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m24s)
01:27:24

[Viagra today I can tell that's that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m25s)
01:27:25

[that yeah okay so do the same thing for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m27s)
01:27:27

[the negative reviews right and then of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m30s)
01:27:30

[course it's nicer to take the log right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m34s)
01:27:34

[because if we take the log then we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m37s)
01:27:37

[add things together rather than multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m39s)
01:27:39

[them together and once you like multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m41s)
01:27:41

[enough of these things together it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m43s)
01:27:43

[going to get kind of so close to zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m44s)
01:27:44

[that you'll probably run out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m46s)
01:27:46

[floating-point right so we take the log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m47s)
01:27:47

[of the ratios and then we come as I say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m49s)
01:27:49

[we then multiply that or a log we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m56s)
01:27:56

[subtract that from the so you add that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h27m58s)
01:27:58

[to the ratio of the class the whole plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m01s)
01:28:01

[probabilities all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m05s)
01:28:05

[so in order to say for each document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m08s)
01:28:08

[multiply the phase probabilities by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m12s)
01:28:12

[accounts we can just use matrix model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m16s)
01:28:16

[plane okay and then to add on the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m18s)
01:28:18

[log of the class ratios we can just use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m23s)
01:28:23

[plus B and so we end up with something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m27s)
01:28:27

[that looks a lot like our logistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m29s)
01:28:29

[regression right but we're not learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m32s)
01:28:32

[anything right not in kind of assess GED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m34s)
01:28:34

[point of view we're just we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m37s)
01:28:37

[calculating it using this theoretical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m39s)
01:28:39

[model okay and so as I said we can then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m41s)
01:28:41

[compare that as to whether it's bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m43s)
01:28:43

[or smaller than zero not one anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m45s)
01:28:45

[because we're now in log space right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m47s)
01:28:47

[then we can compare that to the mean and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m50s)
01:28:50

[we say okay that's 80% accurate 81 was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m52s)
01:28:52

[inaccurate right so naive Bayes you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m55s)
01:28:55

[is not it's not nothing it gave us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h28m58s)
01:28:58

[something okay it turns out that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m01s)
01:29:01

[version where we're actually looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m06s)
01:29:06

[how often a word appears like absurd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m09s)
01:29:09

[appeared twice it turns out at least for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m11s)
01:29:11

[this problem and quite often it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m14s)
01:29:14

[matter whether absurd appeared twice or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m16s)
01:29:16

[once all that matters is that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m18s)
01:29:18

[appeared so what what people tend to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m20s)
01:29:20

[doing is to say take the two other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m23s)
01:29:23

[term document matrix and go dot sine dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m26s)
01:29:26

[sign replaces anything positive as one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m30s)
01:29:30

[and anything negative with negative one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m33s)
01:29:33

[we don't have any negative counts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m35s)
01:29:35

[obviously so this buying arises it so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m37s)
01:29:37

[says it's I don't care that you saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m39s)
01:29:39

[absurd twice and it's care that you saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m41s)
01:29:41

[it right so if we do exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m44s)
01:29:44

[thing with the binarized version then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m47s)
01:29:47

[you get a better result okay okay now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h29m52s)
01:29:52

[this is the difference between theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m02s)
01:30:02

[and practice right in theory naive Bayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m04s)
01:30:04

[sounds okay but it's it's naive unlike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m09s)
01:30:09

[Tyla it's naive right so what Tyler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m11s)
01:30:11

[would probably do would instead say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m13s)
01:30:13

[rather than assuming that I should use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m15s)
01:30:15

[these coefficients ah why don't we learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m19s)
01:30:19

[them so it sound reasonable Tyler yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m22s)
01:30:22

[okay so let's learn them so we can you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m25s)
01:30:25

[know we can totally learn them so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m28s)
01:30:28

[create a logistic regression right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m29s)
01:30:29

[let's fit some coefficients and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m32s)
01:30:32

[going to literally give us something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m36s)
01:30:36

[with exactly the same functional form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m37s)
01:30:37

[that we had before but now rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[using a theoretical R and a theoretical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m41s)
01:30:41

[B we're going to calculate the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m44s)
01:30:44

[things based on logistic regression and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m46s)
01:30:46

[that's better okay so so it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m48s)
01:30:48

[like yeah why why do something based on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h30m56s)
01:30:56

[some theoretical model because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m00s)
01:31:00

[theoretical models are never gonna be as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m01s)
01:31:01

[accurate pretty much as a data-driven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m04s)
01:31:04

[model right because theoretical models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m06s)
01:31:06

[unless you're dealing with some I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m08s)
01:31:08

[know like physics thing or something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m11s)
01:31:11

[where you're like okay this is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m13s)
01:31:13

[how the world works there really is no I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m14s)
01:31:14

[don't know we're working in a vacuum and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m16s)
01:31:16

[this is the exact gravity and blah blah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m19s)
01:31:19

[blah right but most of the real world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m20s)
01:31:20

[this is how things are like it's better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m23s)
01:31:23

[to lie on your coefficients and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m25s)
01:31:25

[calculate them yes you know generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m27s)
01:31:27

[what's this do liquid through I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m31s)
01:31:31

[hoping you'd ignore not notice but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m35s)
01:31:35

[or basically in this case our term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m37s)
01:31:37

[document matrix is much wider than it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m42s)
01:31:42

[tall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m44s)
01:31:44

[there is a reformulation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m45s)
01:31:45

[mathematically basically almost a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m48s)
01:31:48

[mathematically equivalent reformulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m50s)
01:31:50

[of logistic regression that happens to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m51s)
01:31:51

[be a lot faster when it's wider than it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m53s)
01:31:53

[is tall so the short answer is if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m55s)
01:31:55

[don't put that here anytime it's wider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m57s)
01:31:57

[than it is tall what really comes true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h31m59s)
01:31:59

[it'll run this runs in like two seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m01s)
01:32:01

[if you don't have it here it'll take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m03s)
01:32:03

[few minutes so like in math this is kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m05s)
01:32:05

[of concept of dual versions of problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m08s)
01:32:08

[which are kind of like equivalent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m11s)
01:32:11

[versions that sometimes work better for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m14s)
01:32:14

[certain situations okay here is so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m16s)
01:32:16

[is the binarized version okay and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m22s)
01:32:22

[it's about the same right so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m27s)
01:32:27

[I've fitted it with the the sine of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m29s)
01:32:29

[dock of the dr. Murdock matrix and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m32s)
01:32:32

[predicted it with this right now the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m35s)
01:32:35

[thing is that this is going to be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m39s)
01:32:39

[coefficient for every term where I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m42s)
01:32:42

[about 75,000 terms in their vocabulary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m46s)
01:32:46

[and that seems like a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m49s)
01:32:49

[coefficients given that we've only got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m51s)
01:32:51

[twenty five thousand reviews so maybe we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m53s)
01:32:53

[should try regularizing this so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m56s)
01:32:56

[use regularization built into SK learns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h32m59s)
01:32:59

[logistic regression class which is C is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m02s)
01:33:02

[the parameter that they use a small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m05s)
01:33:05

[process is slightly weird as smaller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m07s)
01:33:07

[parameter is more regularization right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m09s)
01:33:09

[so that's why I used wanting eight to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m12s)
01:33:12

[basically turn off regularization yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m13s)
01:33:13

[so if I turn on regularization set it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m15s)
01:33:15

[0.1 then now it's 88% okay which makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m18s)
01:33:18

[sense you know you wouldn't you would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m22s)
01:33:22

[think like 75,000 parameters for 25,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m23s)
01:33:23

[documents you know it's likely to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m27s)
01:33:27

[overfit indeed it did overfit so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m29s)
01:33:29

[adding l2 regularization to avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m32s)
01:33:32

[overfitting I mentioned earlier that as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m34s)
01:33:34

[well as l2 which is looking at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m39s)
01:33:39

[weight squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m41s)
01:33:41

[there's also l1 which is looking at just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m42s)
01:33:42

[the absolute value of the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m48s)
01:33:48

[right I I was kind of pretty sloppy in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m51s)
01:33:51

[my wording before I said that l/2 who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m57s)
01:33:57

[tries to make things zero that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h33m59s)
01:33:59

[true but if you've got two things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m02s)
01:34:02

[are highly correlated then l2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m04s)
01:34:04

[regularization will make move them both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m06s)
01:34:06

[down together it won't make one of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m09s)
01:34:09

[zero and one of them nonzero right so l1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m11s)
01:34:11

[regularization actually has the property](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m14s)
01:34:14

[that it'll try to make as many things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m16s)
01:34:16

[zero as possible where else l2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m19s)
01:34:19

[regularization has a property that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m21s)
01:34:21

[tends to try to make kind of everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m23s)
01:34:23

[smaller we actually don't care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m25s)
01:34:25

[that difference in really any modern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[machine learning because we very rarely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m30s)
01:34:30

[try to directly interpret the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m32s)
01:34:32

[coefficients we try to understand our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m34s)
01:34:34

[models through interrogation using the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m36s)
01:34:36

[kind of techniques that we've learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m39s)
01:34:39

[the reason that we would care about l1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m40s)
01:34:40

[versus l2 is simply like which one ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m43s)
01:34:43

[up with a better error on the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m45s)
01:34:45

[set okay and you can try both with SK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m47s)
01:34:47

[learns logistic regression l2 actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m51s)
01:34:51

[turns out to be a lot faster because you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m53s)
01:34:53

[can't use your equals true unless you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m56s)
01:34:56

[have L 2 so you know and l2 is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h34m58s)
01:34:58

[default so I didn't really worry too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m00s)
01:35:00

[much about that difference yet so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m02s)
01:35:02

[can see here if we use regularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m05s)
01:35:05

[and binarized we actually do pretty well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m08s)
01:35:08

[okay so yes can you pass that back to W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m12s)
01:35:12

[please before we learned about elastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m20s)
01:35:20

[net right like combining l1 and l2 yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m25s)
01:35:25

[yeah yeah you can do that but I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m27s)
01:35:27

[it's like you know with with deeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m30s)
01:35:30

[models and yeah I've never seen anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m33s)
01:35:33

[find that useful okay so the last thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m36s)
01:35:36

[I'll mention is that you can when you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m42s)
01:35:42

[your count vectorizer order that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m46s)
01:35:46

[when you do your account vectorizer you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m49s)
01:35:49

[can also ask for n grams right by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m51s)
01:35:51

[default we get uni grams that is single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m54s)
01:35:54

[words but if we if we say Engram range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h35m56s)
01:35:56

[equals 1 comma 3 that's also going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m01s)
01:36:01

[give us by grams and trigrams by which I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m04s)
01:36:04

[mean if I now say okay let's go ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m08s)
01:36:08

[and do the count vectorizer cat feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m10s)
01:36:10

[names now my vocabulary includes a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m14s)

[. 5 euro miles right so this is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m22s)
01:36:22

[doing the same thing but after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m26s)
01:36:26

[tokenizing it's not describing each word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m28s)
01:36:28

[and saying that's part of our vocabulary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m31s)
01:36:31

[two words next to each other and each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m32s)
01:36:32

[three words next to each other and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m35s)
01:36:35

[10 this turns out to be like super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m36s)
01:36:36

[helpful in like taking advantage of bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m40s)
01:36:40

[of word approaches because we now can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m42s)
01:36:42

[see like the difference between like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m46s)
01:36:46

[know not good versus not bad this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m49s)
01:36:49

[terrible right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m53s)
01:36:53

[or even like double quote good double](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m56s)
01:36:56

[quote which is probably going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h36m59s)
01:36:59

[sarcastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m00s)
01:37:00

[right so using trigram features actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m01s)
01:37:01

[is going to turn out to make both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m06s)
01:37:06

[naivebayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m07s)
01:37:07

[and logistic regression quite a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m08s)
01:37:08

[better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m11s)
01:37:11

[it really takes us quite a lot further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m12s)
01:37:12

[and makes them quite useful I have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m14s)
01:37:14

[question about the token icers so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m17s)
01:37:17

[are saying some marks features so how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m23s)
01:37:23

[are these diagrams and trigrams selected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m25s)
01:37:25

[right so since I'm using a linear model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m29s)
01:37:29

[I didn't want to create too many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m34s)
01:37:34

[features I mean it actually worked fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m38s)
01:37:38

[even without max features I think I had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m39s)
01:37:39

[something like I can't remember 70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m41s)
01:37:41

[million coefficients it still worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m43s)
01:37:43

[right but just there's no need to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m45s)
01:37:45

[70 million coefficients so if you say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m47s)
01:37:47

[max features equals 800,000 the count](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m50s)
01:37:50

[vectorizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m53s)
01:37:53

[will sort the vocabulary by how often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m54s)
01:37:54

[everything appears whether it be uni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m56s)
01:37:56

[ground by graham diagram and it will cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h37m59s)
01:37:59

[it off after the first 800,000 most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m01s)
01:38:01

[common engrams Engram is just a generic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m05s)
01:38:05

[word for uni gram by Graham and trigram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m08s)
01:38:08

[so that's why the train term doctype is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m12s)
01:38:12

[now 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m17s)
01:38:17

[thousand by 800,000 and like if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m17s)
01:38:17

[not sure what number this should be I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m20s)
01:38:20

[just picked something that was really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m22s)
01:38:22

[big and you know didn't didn't worry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m24s)
01:38:24

[about it too much and it seemed to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m27s)
01:38:27

[fine like it's not terribly sensitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m28s)
01:38:28

[all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m33s)
01:38:33

[okay well that's we're out of time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m35s)
01:38:35

[what we're going to see next week and by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m37s)
01:38:37

[the way you know we could have replaced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m40s)
01:38:40

[this logistic regression with our PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m43s)
01:38:43

[torch version and next week we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m45s)
01:38:45

[actually see something in the fast a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m48s)
01:38:48

[library that does exactly that but also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m50s)
01:38:50

[what we'll see next week starting next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m53s)
01:38:53

[week tomorrow is how to combine logistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m54s)
01:38:54

[regression and naive Bayes together you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h38m59s)
01:38:59

[get something that's better than either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h39m01s)
01:39:01

[and then we'll learn how to move from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h39m03s)
01:39:03

[there to create a deeper neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h39m05s)
01:39:05

[to get a pretty much state-of-the-art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h39m09s)
01:39:09

[result for structured learning all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h39m12s)
01:39:12

[so we'll see you then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sFIak42Sc#t=01h39m14s)
