[so yeah this week obviously quite a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m01s)
00:00:01

[quite a bit just to get get set up to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m09s)
00:00:09

[get results from this week in terms of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m12s)
00:00:12

[meeting and all of imagenet and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m15s)
00:00:15

[kind of thing getting all that working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m17s)
00:00:17

[though I know that a lot of you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m19s)
00:00:19

[working through that I didn't want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m21s)
00:00:21

[mention a couple of reminders just that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m25s)
00:00:25

[I've noticed and one is that in general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m29s)
00:00:29

[we have that a thing on the wiki about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m32s)
00:00:32

[like how to use the log books and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m35s)
00:00:35

[really strongly advise that you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m37s)
00:00:37

[open up the notebook we give you and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m39s)
00:00:39

[like click shift enter through it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m42s)
00:00:42

[and again you're not really going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m44s)
00:00:44

[learn much from that but go back to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m45s)
00:00:45

[wiki page is that the first thing as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m49s)
00:00:49

[mentioned in the first paragraph of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m51s)
00:00:51

[home page for wiki is like how to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m52s)
00:00:52

[the notebook basically the idea is try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m54s)
00:00:54

[to start with a fresh notebook think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m58s)
00:00:58

[about to think you need to do first try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h00m59s)
00:00:59

[and do that thing if you have no idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m01s)
00:01:01

[then you can go to the existing notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m03s)
00:01:03

[take a peek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m05s)
00:01:05

[close it again primary implement what to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m06s)
00:01:06

[the store as much as possible we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m09s)
00:01:09

[really don't just shift enter through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m12s)
00:01:12

[the notebooks and I know you've covered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m14s)
00:01:14

[you're doing it because there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m16s)
00:01:16

[threads on the forum saying oh is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m18s)
00:01:18

[shift entry for the notebook and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m19s)
00:01:19

[thing didn't work and somebody's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m21s)
00:01:21

[well could that things about to find it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m23s)
00:01:23

[so consider yourself busted all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m25s)
00:01:25

[and the other thing to remind you about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m31s)
00:01:31

[is that the goal of part two is to kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m33s)
00:01:33

[of get you to a point where you can read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m37s)
00:01:37

[papers and the reason for that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m40s)
00:01:40

[because you kind of know the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m42s)
00:01:42

[practices now so anytime you want to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m44s)
00:01:44

[something beyond what we've learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[you're going to be kind of implementing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m48s)
00:01:48

[things in papers so probably going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m51s)
00:01:51

[beyond that and implementing new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m53s)
00:01:53

[um reading a new paper and in areas that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m54s)
00:01:54

[you haven't looked at before is a needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h01m58s)
00:01:58

[to me somewhat terrifying on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m01s)
00:02:01

[hand reading a paper for the thing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m04s)
00:02:04

[we already studied last week hopefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m07s)
00:02:07

[isn't terrifying at all because you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m10s)
00:02:10

[already know what the paper says so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m12s)
00:02:12

[always have that many assignments each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m15s)
00:02:15

[week is like read the paper for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m17s)
00:02:17

[thing you just learned about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m19s)
00:02:19

[and like go back over it and please not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m20s)
00:02:20

[from a forums if there's a bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m22s)
00:02:22

[notation or anything that you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m23s)
00:02:23

[understand or if there's something we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m27s)
00:02:27

[heard in class that you can't see in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m28s)
00:02:28

[paper or literally interesting you see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m30s)
00:02:30

[something in the paper that you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m33s)
00:02:33

[think we're interested in class so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m34s)
00:02:34

[that's the reason that I really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m37s)
00:02:37

[encourage you to read the papers that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m38s)
00:02:38

[we've studied in you know the work for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m42s)
00:02:42

[the topics we studied in class I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m44s)
00:02:44

[it's for those of you like me who don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m47s)
00:02:47

[have a technical academic background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m49s)
00:02:49

[it's really great way to familiarize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m51s)
00:02:51

[familiarize yourself with notation and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m56s)
00:02:56

[I'm really really looking forward but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h02m58s)
00:02:58

[some of you asking about location on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m00s)
00:03:00

[forum so I can explain a number to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m02s)
00:03:02

[like there's a few key things that and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m04s)
00:03:04

[keep coming up in notation like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m07s)
00:03:07

[probability distributions and stuff like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m09s)
00:03:09

[that so please feel free and if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m12s)
00:03:12

[watching this later in the book again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[feel free to ask them inform anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[that's not clear um I was kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m20s)
00:03:20

[interested in following up on some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m23s)
00:03:23

[last week's experiments myself and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[thing that kind of I think we all were a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m28s)
00:03:28

[bit shocked about was was putting this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m31s)
00:03:31

[guy into the device model and getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m33s)
00:03:33

[out more pictures of similar-looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m36s)
00:03:36

[fish in in there and I was kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m38s)
00:03:38

[curious about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m41s)
00:03:41

[you know how that is working and how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m43s)
00:03:43

[well that was working and I then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m45s)
00:03:45

[completely broke things by training it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[for a few more eight bucks and after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m50s)
00:03:50

[doing that I then did an image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m52s)
00:03:52

[similarity search again and I got these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m53s)
00:03:53

[three guys who are longer in men's so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h03m55s)
00:03:55

[I'm not quite sure what's going on here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m00s)
00:04:00

[and the other thing I mentioned is when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m02s)
00:04:02

[I trained it where my starting point was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m07s)
00:04:07

[what we looked at in class which was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[just before the final bottleneck layer I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m11s)
00:04:11

[didn't get very good results from this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m14s)
00:04:14

[thing but when I trained it from that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m16s)
00:04:16

[low starting point of just after the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m19s)
00:04:19

[bottleneck layer I got the good results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m21s)
00:04:21

[that that you saw and again I don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m24s)
00:04:24

[why that is and I don't think this has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m28s)
00:04:28

[been studied as far as I'm aware so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m29s)
00:04:29

[there's lots of open questions here but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m32s)
00:04:32

[I'll show you something I did then do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m33s)
00:04:33

[with it well that's interesting I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m35s)
00:04:35

[what's happened here is that it's focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m38s)
00:04:38

[it when you train it for longer it knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m41s)
00:04:41

[that the important thing is the fish not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m43s)
00:04:43

[the net and it seems to be now focusing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m44s)
00:04:44

[on giving us the same kind of fish like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m47s)
00:04:47

[these are clearly the exact same at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m48s)
00:04:48

[fish I guess so anyway so I started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m52s)
00:04:52

[wondering how could we force it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m55s)
00:04:55

[combine but I tried the most obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h04m57s)
00:04:57

[possible thing I want to get more fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m00s)
00:05:00

[in there and I typed words of ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m02s)
00:05:02

[pinch the kind of fish plus words of X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m06s)
00:05:06

[dicks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m08s)
00:05:08

[net / to get the average of the two work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m09s)
00:05:09

[vectors and give me the nearest neighbor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m12s)
00:05:12

[and that's what I got and then just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m15s)
00:05:15

[prove it wasn't the flukes I tried the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m18s)
00:05:18

[same on tench + rod and there's my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m20s)
00:05:20

[nearest neighbor now after you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m23s)
00:05:23

[what's really freaky about this if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m25s)
00:05:25

[google for image net categories you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m27s)
00:05:27

[get a list - 4000 image net categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m30s)
00:05:30

[if you search through them movin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m32s)
00:05:32

[national right appear at all like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[can't begin to imagine why this works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m37s)
00:05:37

[but it does so this device model is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m40s)
00:05:40

[clearly doing some pretty deep magic in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m45s)
00:05:45

[terms of the understanding of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m48s)
00:05:48

[objects in the relationships that not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m50s)
00:05:50

[only are we able to combine things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m52s)
00:05:52

[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m54s)
00:05:54

[but we're able to combine it with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[categories that is literally ever seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m56s)

[before it's never seen a rod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h05m59s)

[we've never taught at what a rod looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m01s)
00:06:01

[like and get over a net and I tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m03s)
00:06:03

[quite a few of these combinations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m06s)
00:06:06

[they just kept working like another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m07s)
00:06:07

[I tried was now I understand why this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m09s)
00:06:09

[works which is I tried searching for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m12s)

[boat now both doesn't have here an image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m14s)
00:06:14

[- but there's lots of kinds of bugs that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m17s)
00:06:17

[appear in the Internet so not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m19s)
00:06:19

[surprisingly they figured out generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m20s)
00:06:20

[thinking had at my boat so I didn't I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m22s)
00:06:22

[didn't expect that and then I tried boat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m24s)
00:06:24

[plus engine and I got better pictures of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m27s)
00:06:27

[our boats and then I tried both plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m30s)
00:06:30

[paddle and I'd like that pictures of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m32s)
00:06:32

[rowing boats so this whole lot going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m34s)
00:06:34

[here and I think there's lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m38s)
00:06:38

[opportunities for you to explore and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m39s)
00:06:39

[experiment based on the inspirations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m41s)
00:06:41

[experiments that I've done and what a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m43s)
00:06:43

[point you have to create some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m46s)
00:06:46

[interesting and valuable tools you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m47s)
00:06:47

[like I would have thought at all to do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m51s)
00:06:51

[kind of an image search to say show me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m55s)
00:06:55

[all the images that contain these kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m57s)
00:06:57

[of objects or better still maybe you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h06m59s)
00:06:59

[start training with things that I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m01s)
00:07:01

[now but also adjectives that like search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m04s)
00:07:04

[for you know pictures of crying babies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m07s)
00:07:07

[or flaming houses or whatever I mean did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m12s)
00:07:12

[I think there's all kind of stuff you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m18s)
00:07:18

[could do with is it really interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m19s)
00:07:19

[whether it be in your in a narrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m20s)
00:07:20

[organizational setting or to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m24s)
00:07:24

[something you start up for the open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m26s)
00:07:26

[source project or whatever so anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m28s)
00:07:28

[lots of things to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m30s)
00:07:30

[I lost stuff this week actually miss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m33s)
00:07:33

[difficulty this week I was thrilled to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m39s)
00:07:39

[see that um one of our students has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m41s)
00:07:41

[written this fantastic median plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m43s)
00:07:43

[linear algebra cheat sheet I think I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m45s)
00:07:45

[missed it because it was posted not to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m47s)
00:07:47

[the plat two or maybe to the main form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[this is really cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m54s)
00:07:54

[brendan has gone through and really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m57s)
00:07:57

[explained I think all the stuff that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[would have wanted to learn about linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m01s)
00:08:01

[algebra before I got started and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m03s)
00:08:03

[particularly I really appreciate that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m05s)
00:08:05

[and of taking a code first approach so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[like how do you actually do this in non](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m10s)
00:08:10

[hi and talking about broadcasting so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m12s)
00:08:12

[guys will all be very familiar this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m15s)
00:08:15

[already but your friends who are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m16s)
00:08:16

[wondering how to get started in deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m18s)
00:08:18

[learning you know what's the minimal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m21s)
00:08:21

[things you so it's probably the chain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m23s)
00:08:23

[rule ones and winning in algebra I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m25s)
00:08:25

[this covers a lot of any linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[pretty effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[so thank you Brendan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m30s)
00:08:30

[so other things from last week Andrea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m34s)
00:08:34

[from who who wrote that devised paper I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m39s)
00:08:39

[actually emailed her and asked her what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m42s)
00:08:42

[she thought I what else I should look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m44s)
00:08:44

[and she suggested this paper zero shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m46s)
00:08:46

[learning by a convex combination of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m49s)
00:08:49

[semantic and Eddings which is only a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m51s)
00:08:51

[later author on but she says it's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m54s)
00:08:54

[of in some ways a you know a more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h08m56s)
00:08:56

[powerful version of dividing day it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m00s)
00:09:00

[actually quite different and I haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m02s)
00:09:02

[implemented it myself but it opens is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m05s)
00:09:05

[that it solves some similar problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m07s)
00:09:07

[anybody who's interested in exploring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m09s)
00:09:09

[this multimodal images and text space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[might be interested in this and we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m14s)
00:09:14

[put this some on the lesson wiki of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m16s)
00:09:16

[course and then one more involving the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m18s)
00:09:18

[same author in a similar area a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m23s)
00:09:23

[bit later we're looking at some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m25s)
00:09:25

[attention for fine-grained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m28s)
00:09:28

[categorization so a lot of these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m30s)
00:09:30

[but it's the way I think Andrea Framm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m32s)
00:09:32

[was casting it was about fine grained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m34s)
00:09:34

[categorization which is you know how do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[we build something that can find like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m40s)
00:09:40

[very specific kinds of birds or very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m42s)
00:09:42

[specific kinds of dogs I think these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[kinds of models have very very wider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m47s)
00:09:47

[crucial their applicability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m54s)
00:09:54

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m56s)
00:09:56

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h09m57s)
00:09:57

[so um I mentioned would kind of wrap up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[some final topics around kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m03s)
00:10:03

[computer vision he stuff this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m04s)
00:10:04

[before we started looking at some more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m06s)
00:10:06

[NLP related stuff one of the things I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m09s)
00:10:09

[wanted to dip through with the paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m12s)
00:10:12

[which I think some of you might enjoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m14s)
00:10:14

[systematic evaluation of CN n advances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m15s)
00:10:15

[on the image then data set and I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m18s)
00:10:18

[pulled out what I thought was some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m22s)
00:10:22

[some of the key insights for some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m23s)
00:10:23

[these the things we haven't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m25s)
00:10:25

[looked at before one key insight which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m26s)
00:10:26

[is very much the kind of thing I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m30s)
00:10:30

[appreciate is that they compared what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m31s)
00:10:31

[the difference between the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m36s)
00:10:36

[original cafe necklace Alex net versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m37s)
00:10:37

[Google map versus EG g net on two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m40s)
00:10:40

[different sized images training on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m43s)
00:10:43

[original 227 or 128 and what this chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m45s)
00:10:45

[shows is that the relative difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[between these different architectures is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m52s)
00:10:52

[almost exactly the same regardless of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m55s)
00:10:55

[what size image you're looking at and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h10m57s)
00:10:57

[this really reminds me of like in part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m00s)
00:11:00

[one when we look at data augmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m01s)
00:11:01

[and we said hey you can understand which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m03s)
00:11:03

[types of data augmentation to use and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m06s)
00:11:06

[how much on a small sample of the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m08s)
00:11:08

[right and on the whole dataset and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m10s)
00:11:10

[this paper saying is something similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m13s)
00:11:13

[which is you can look at different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m14s)
00:11:14

[architectures on small sized images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m16s)
00:11:16

[rather than full size images and so they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m19s)
00:11:19

[then use this insight to do all of their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m22s)
00:11:22

[experiments from then on using a smaller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m25s)
00:11:25

[128 by 128 image net model which says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m27s)
00:11:27

[that was ten times faster so that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m30s)
00:11:30

[the kind of thing which not have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m33s)
00:11:33

[academic edges do like what are the what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m35s)
00:11:35

[are the hacky shortcuts we can get away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m38s)
00:11:38

[with so they tried lots of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m39s)
00:11:39

[activation functions it does look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m44s)
00:11:44

[max pooling is way better so this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m48s)
00:11:48

[gain compared to earlier but this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m52s)
00:11:52

[actually has twice the complexity so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m56s)
00:11:56

[doesn't quite say that what it really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h11m59s)
00:11:59

[says is that something we haven't looked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m02s)
00:12:02

[at which is Leu which is as you can did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m04s)
00:12:04

[very simple if X is greater than or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m07s)
00:12:07

[equal zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m10s)
00:12:10

[swipers X otherwise it's e to the X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m11s)
00:12:11

[minus one so Lu basically is just like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m14s)
00:12:14

[rail you except it's smooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m20s)
00:12:20

[earlier looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m25s)
00:12:25

[man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m30s)
00:12:30

[um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[yeah your looks exactly the same here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m34s)
00:12:34

[then here it goes like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m38s)
00:12:38

[kind of a nice smooth version but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m43s)
00:12:43

[there's one thing you might want to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m45s)
00:12:45

[using another thing they tried which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m46s)
00:12:46

[interesting with using elu for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m49s)
00:12:49

[convolutional layers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m52s)
00:12:52

[now so I'm trying to say max out for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h12m58s)
00:12:58

[fully connected letters I guess nowadays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m02s)
00:13:02

[which I've use fully connected layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m04s)
00:13:04

[very much so you know maybe that's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m05s)
00:13:05

[it interesting so main in training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m07s)
00:13:07

[testing thing here I think is the Euro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m10s)
00:13:10

[elu activation function to patatas point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m11s)
00:13:11

[that's quite a big difference there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[looks a different loading rate annealing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m19s)
00:13:19

[approaches and you can use care us to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[automatically do learning rather dealing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m24s)
00:13:24

[and what they showed is that linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[annealing seems to work best they try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m27s)
00:13:27

[something else which was like what about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m33s)
00:13:33

[different colour transformations you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m35s)
00:13:35

[know and they found that amongst some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m37s)
00:13:37

[normal approaches to think about color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m39s)
00:13:39

[RGB actually seems to work the best but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m41s)
00:13:41

[then they trade something I haven't seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m44s)
00:13:44

[before which is they added to one by one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m45s)
00:13:45

[convolutions at the very start of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m48s)
00:13:48

[network so each of those one by one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m50s)
00:13:50

[convolutions basically doing a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m52s)
00:13:52

[that's the kind of linear combination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m57s)
00:13:57

[with the channels and were they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h13m59s)
00:13:59

[non-linearity then in between and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m02s)
00:14:02

[found that there actually have gotten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m04s)
00:14:04

[quite a big improvement and that should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m06s)
00:14:06

[be pretty much zero cost so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m10s)
00:14:10

[another thing which I haven't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m12s)
00:14:12

[seen written about elsewhere but it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m14s)
00:14:14

[good trick they looked at the impact of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m15s)
00:14:15

[batch norm so here is a the impact of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m21s)
00:14:21

[batch norm positive or negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m24s)
00:14:24

[actually adding Bastion onto Google net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[didn't help that you made it worse for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m31s)
00:14:31

[thin seeds like really complex carefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m33s)
00:14:33

[tuned architectures you're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m35s)
00:14:35

[pretty careful we're all sort of simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m37s)
00:14:37

[Network it helps a lot and the amount of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[Health sort though depends on someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m43s)
00:14:43

[which activation function use so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m45s)
00:14:45

[norm I think we kind of know that now be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[careful when you use it sometimes it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m52s)
00:14:52

[fantastically helpful sometimes it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m54s)
00:14:54

[like the onion form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[question is there any advantage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m02s)
00:15:02

[musically connected layers turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m04s)
00:15:04

[yeah I mean I think there is like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[terribly out of fashion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m10s)
00:15:10

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m12s)
00:15:12

[but I think for transfer learning they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m15s)
00:15:15

[still seem to be the best in terms of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m19s)
00:15:19

[the kind of you know the fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[layers the superfast train and you seem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m25s)
00:15:25

[to get a lot of flexibility there so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m29s)
00:15:29

[don't think we know one way or another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m32s)
00:15:32

[yet but I do think that PGG still has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m33s)
00:15:33

[lot to give us in terms of you know but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m37s)
00:15:37

[the last carefully tuned thing with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m41s)
00:15:41

[political players and that really since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m44s)
00:15:44

[they'd be great for a transfer learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[and then there was that a comment saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m48s)
00:15:48

[that Elias advantage is not just smooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m50s)
00:15:50

[but it's that it goes a little below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m52s)
00:15:52

[zero dimensions that is actually being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m54s)
00:15:54

[money yeah yeah that's a great point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h15m59s)
00:15:59

[thank you for adding that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[yeah and anytime you hear me say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m04s)
00:16:04

[something slightly stupid please feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m05s)
00:16:05

[free to jump in because otherwise on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m07s)
00:16:07

[video forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m10s)
00:16:10

[so on the other hand it does give you an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m14s)
00:16:14

[improvement in accuracy if you remove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m18s)
00:16:18

[the final mass cooling layer replace all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m21s)
00:16:21

[of the convolutional layers sorry fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m24s)
00:16:24

[connected layers with convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m26s)
00:16:26

[layers and stick a Everage pulling at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[the end and so basically what this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m30s)
00:16:30

[doing so as I've seen there's definitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m32s)
00:16:32

[an upside to political emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m35s)
00:16:35

[networks in terms of accuracy but there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m37s)
00:16:37

[may be a downside in terms of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m39s)
00:16:39

[flexibility around down transfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m41s)
00:16:41

[learning a slit lamp layers tool I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m44s)
00:16:44

[thought this was an interesting picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m49s)
00:16:49

[I hadn't quite seen before let me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m50s)
00:16:50

[explain the picture what this shows is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m52s)
00:16:52

[these are different batch sizes along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m54s)
00:16:54

[the bottom and then we've got accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h16m56s)
00:16:56

[and what it's showing is with a learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m00s)
00:17:00

[rate of 0.01 this is what happens to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[accuracy so as you go above 256 batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m06s)
00:17:06

[size it plummets on the other hand if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m09s)
00:17:09

[you use a learning rate 0.01 times batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m13s)
00:17:13

[size over 256 it's pretty flat so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m16s)
00:17:16

[this suggests to me is that anytime you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m20s)
00:17:20

[change the batch size it's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m22s)
00:17:22

[telling you to change the learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m24s)
00:17:24

[by a proportional amount which I think a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m26s)
00:17:26

[lot of us have realized through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m29s)
00:17:29

[experiment but I don't think I've seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m30s)
00:17:30

[it explicitly mentioned before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m31s)
00:17:31

[I think this is very helpful to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m36s)
00:17:36

[understand as well as the removing data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m38s)
00:17:38

[just has a kind of a nonlinear effect on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m41s)
00:17:41

[accuracy so here's the screen line here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m45s)
00:17:45

[is what happens when you remove images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m47s)
00:17:47

[okay so with image net down to about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m48s)
00:17:48

[half the size of image net there isn't a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m52s)
00:17:52

[huge impact on accuracy so maybe if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m55s)
00:17:55

[want to really speed things up you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m58s)
00:17:58

[128 by one from the a size images and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h17m59s)
00:17:59

[use just 600,000 of them or even maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m02s)
00:18:02

[400,000 but then beneath that it started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m05s)
00:18:05

[to plummet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m08s)
00:18:08

[so I think that's the interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m09s)
00:18:09

[insight another interesting insight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m11s)
00:18:11

[although I'm going to add something to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m14s)
00:18:14

[this in a moment is that rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m16s)
00:18:16

[removing images if you instead it flip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m18s)
00:18:18

[the labels to make them incorrect that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m22s)
00:18:22

[has a worse effect than not having the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m25s)
00:18:25

[data at all but there are things we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m27s)
00:18:27

[do to try and improve things there and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[specifically I want to bring your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m34s)
00:18:34

[attention to this paper training fifth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m36s)

[gear all networks on loyalty levels with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m40s)
00:18:40

[bootstrapping and what this show is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m43s)
00:18:43

[very simple approach a very simple tweak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m45s)
00:18:45

[you can add to any training method which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m48s)
00:18:48

[dramatically improves their ability to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m53s)
00:18:53

[handle handle noisy levels so this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m55s)
00:18:55

[here is showing the if you add noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h18m58s)
00:18:58

[varying from 0.3 0.5 to endless so half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m00s)
00:19:00

[of it the bass lines are doing nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m05s)
00:19:05

[at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m10s)
00:19:10

[it really collapses the accuracy but if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m11s)
00:19:11

[you use their approach to bootstrapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m16s)
00:19:16

[you can actually go up to nearly ah the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m18s)

[well I think this is really important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m28s)
00:19:28

[paper to mention in this like stuff that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m31s)
00:19:31

[most of you will find important and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m33s)
00:19:33

[useful area because most real-world data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[sets have noise in them so maybe this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[something you should consider adding to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m40s)
00:19:40

[everything that you've trained whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m42s)
00:19:42

[it be Apple data sets or your own data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m45s)
00:19:45

[sets or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[particularly because you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m49s)
00:19:49

[necessarily know and have no idea the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m51s)
00:19:51

[labels are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m53s)
00:19:53

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m54s)
00:19:54

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h19m59s)
00:19:59

[so noise labels moods incorrect yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m01s)
00:20:01

[noisy just maintain correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[okay so what's threatened yeah this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m05s)
00:20:05

[this particular paper describes a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m08s)
00:20:08

[particular technique which you can read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m09s)
00:20:09

[during the waitress register](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m12s)
00:20:12

[so interestingly they find that if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m17s)
00:20:17

[take of heg and then add all of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[things together a loser all at once you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[can actually get a pretty big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[performance like it looks in fact like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m27s)
00:20:27

[vgg becomes more accurate in google map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m30s)
00:20:30

[you make all these changes so that's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m34s)
00:20:34

[interesting point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m37s)
00:20:37

[although vgg is very very slow and big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m39s)
00:20:39

[there's lots of stuff that a lot if they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m45s)
00:20:45

[didn't look at they didn't look at data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m47s)
00:20:47

[augmentation different approaches to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[zooming and cropping adding skip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m50s)
00:20:50

[connections like in res mesh or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m53s)
00:20:53

[engineers or our networks different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m56s)
00:20:56

[initialization methods different amount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h20m59s)
00:20:59

[of debt and me the most important is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m01s)
00:21:01

[effect on transfer learning for these to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m06s)
00:21:06

[me or you know are all open questions as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m09s)
00:21:09

[far as I know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m12s)
00:21:12

[and so maybe one of you would like to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m12s)
00:21:12

[create the successor to this you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m14s)
00:21:14

[the more observations on training cnn's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m17s)
00:21:17

[there's another interesting paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m23s)
00:21:23

[although the main interesting thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m26s)
00:21:26

[about this paper is this particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m27s)
00:21:27

[picture so feel free to check it out is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m28s)
00:21:28

[pretty short and simple but this paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m31s)
00:21:31

[is looking at the accuracy versus the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m34s)
00:21:34

[size and the speed of different networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m41s)
00:21:41

[so the size of a bubble is how big is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m44s)
00:21:44

[the network's how many parameters to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m49s)
00:21:49

[that so you can see vgg 16 and vgg 19 as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m50s)
00:21:50

[I far the biggest of any of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m54s)
00:21:54

[networks interestingly the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m56s)
00:21:56

[biggest are the very old basic Alex near](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h21m59s)
00:21:59

[so interestingly newer networks tend to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m02s)
00:22:02

[have a lot less parameters which is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m05s)
00:22:05

[concern then on this axis we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m06s)
00:22:06

[basically how long does it take to Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m09s)
00:22:09

[so again vgg is big and slow and without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m14s)
00:22:14

[at least some tweaks not to every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m19s)
00:22:19

[accurate so again you know there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m22s)
00:22:22

[definitely reasons not to use vgg even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m25s)
00:22:25

[if they'll easier so transfer learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m27s)
00:22:27

[or we don't necessarily know how to do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m30s)
00:22:30

[great job of transfer learning on ResNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m33s)
00:22:33

[or inception but as you can see the more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m36s)
00:22:36

[recent resident and inception based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m39s)
00:22:39

[approaches are basically more accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m41s)
00:22:41

[and faster and smaller so this is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m44s)
00:22:44

[think why you know I was looking last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m49s)
00:22:49

[week trying to do transfer learning on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m51s)
00:22:51

[top of ResNet is this really good reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m53s)
00:22:53

[to want to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m56s)
00:22:56

[I think this is a great feature and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h22m58s)
00:22:58

[know these two papers really show us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m02s)
00:23:02

[that that academic papers are not always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m04s)
00:23:04

[just his some highly theoretical wacky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m06s)
00:23:06

[results he told from time to time people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m11s)
00:23:11

[write these great Sarah you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m12s)
00:23:12

[analyses of like best practices and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m15s)
00:23:15

[everything that's going on so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m18s)
00:23:18

[some really great stuff out there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m19s)
00:23:19

[one other paper to mention in this kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m25s)
00:23:25

[of broad ideas about things that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m28s)
00:23:28

[might find helpful as a paper by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m31s)
00:23:31

[somebody named Leslie Smith's who I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m34s)
00:23:34

[think is going to be just about the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m36s)
00:23:36

[unlock to researcher lytic Smith there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m41s)
00:23:41

[a lot of really great papers which I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m44s)
00:23:44

[really like this particular paper came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m46s)
00:23:46

[up with a list of 14 design patents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m50s)
00:23:50

[which seem to be generally associated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m53s)
00:23:53

[with with better CNS and this is a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h23m57s)
00:23:57

[paper to read is so it's a really easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m00s)
00:24:00

[read you guys won't have any trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m02s)
00:24:02

[with it at all I don't think that's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m04s)
00:24:04

[short and but I really looked through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m06s)
00:24:06

[all these I just kind of thought yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m08s)
00:24:08

[these all make a lot of sense and so as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m09s)
00:24:09

[you if you're doing something a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m12s)
00:24:12

[different in a bit new and you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m13s)
00:24:13

[design a new architecture this would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m15s)
00:24:15

[a great list of patterns who look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m17s)
00:24:17

[through one more Leslie Smith paper to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m19s)
00:24:19

[mention and there's crazy that this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m23s)
00:24:23

[not more well-known something incredibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m25s)
00:24:25

[simple which is a different approach to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m28s)
00:24:28

[learning rates rather than just having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m32s)
00:24:32

[your learning rate gradually decrease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m34s)
00:24:34

[I'm sure a lot of you have noticed that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m35s)
00:24:35

[sometimes if you have suddenly increase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m38s)
00:24:38

[the learning rate for a bit and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m41s)
00:24:41

[suddenly decrease it again forget it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m42s)
00:24:42

[kind of goes into a better little area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m43s)
00:24:43

[so what this paper suggests doing is try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m47s)
00:24:47

[actually continually increasing your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m49s)
00:24:49

[learning rate and then decreasing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m52s)
00:24:52

[increasing and decreasing it increasing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m53s)
00:24:53

[and decreasing it something that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m55s)
00:24:55

[call lexical learning rooms and check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h24m58s)
00:24:58

[out the implant compared to non flexible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[approaches it is way way faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m07s)
00:25:07

[and much and it gets at it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m11s)
00:25:11

[fire at every point it's much better and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m14s)
00:25:14

[this is something which you could easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m17s)
00:25:17

[add and I haven't seen this added to any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m19s)
00:25:19

[library so like if you created the psych](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m23s)
00:25:23

[circle learning rate annealing class for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m27s)

[well actually many people would have no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m33s)
00:25:33

[idea what you're talking about to throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m34s)
00:25:34

[out the blog post explain why would and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m36s)

[show them this picture and they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m38s)
00:25:38

[exempt you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m40s)

[children quickly as it clears with lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m44s)
00:25:44

[of callbacks that they issue do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m47s)
00:25:47

[something yeah exactly great look was a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[bunch of called branch and a dog and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m51s)
00:25:51

[I was doing this and care us what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m53s)
00:25:53

[would do would be I would start with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h25m55s)

[changes until it starts working this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m04s)
00:26:04

[already sir it was already code but does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m06s)

[pretty much everything you want and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m08s)

[other cool thing about this paper is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m12s)

[learning rate B is something which we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m25s)
00:26:25

[tend to use a lot of trial and error for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m26s)
00:26:26

[but check out this paper for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m28s)

[suggestion about how to do it somewhat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m30s)
00:26:30

[automatically okay so there's a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m33s)
00:26:33

[bunch of things that I've zipped over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m38s)
00:26:38

[normally I would have dug into each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m39s)
00:26:39

[those explained darshan shown examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m41s)
00:26:41

[and notebooks and stuff but this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m43s)
00:26:43

[a you know you guys hopefully now have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m45s)
00:26:45

[enough knowledge to take this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m49s)
00:26:49

[information and play with it and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m51s)
00:26:51

[I'm hoping is that different people will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m54s)
00:26:54

[play with different parts and come back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m55s)
00:26:55

[and tell us what you find and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h26m57s)
00:26:57

[hopefully we'll get some good new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m00s)
00:27:00

[contributions to care us or high-torque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m01s)
00:27:01

[shorts and blog posts or sand papers or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m04s)
00:27:04

[so forth so maybe that divides our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m06s)
00:27:06

[seasons and new applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m09s)
00:27:09

[so the next thing high water to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m13s)
00:27:13

[and again somewhat briefly is the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m15s)

[Science Bowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m22s)

[and the reason I particularly wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m25s)
00:27:25

[think into the data Science Bowl is with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m27s)
00:27:27

[a couple reasons one one there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m29s)
00:27:29

[million reasons it's a million dollar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m33s)
00:27:33

[prize and there are 23 days to go the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[second is it's it's an extension for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m40s)
00:27:40

[everything that you guys have learned so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m43s)
00:27:43

[far about computer vision it uses all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m44s)
00:27:44

[the techniques you've learned but then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m47s)
00:27:47

[time so rather than 2d images they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m49s)
00:27:49

[going to be 3d volumes rather than being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m52s)
00:27:52

[kind of 300 by 300 or 500 by 500 they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h27m57s)
00:27:57

[going to be 512 by 512 by 200 so like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m01s)
00:28:01

[couple of hundred times but bigger than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m05s)
00:28:05

[ joke was before the stuff we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m06s)
00:28:06

[learnt in lesson seven about like where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m10s)
00:28:10

[are the fish you're going to be needing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[to use a lot of that so I think it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m14s)
00:28:14

[really interesting problem to solve and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[then I personally care a lot about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[because my previous startup Kemetic was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[the first organization to use tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m25s)
00:28:25

[learning to example this exact problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m27s)
00:28:27

[which is trying to find one cancer in CT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m29s)
00:28:29

[scans the reason I made that and look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m34s)
00:28:34

[the first problem with mainly because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m37s)
00:28:37

[learned that if you can find one cancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m41s)
00:28:41

[earlier the probability of survival is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m43s)
00:28:43

[10 times higher so here is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m45s)
00:28:45

[where you can have a real impact in are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m48s)
00:28:48

[both buggering as well which is not to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m52s)
00:28:52

[say that a million dollars in the big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m55s)
00:28:55

[impact as well so let me tell you a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h28m57s)
00:28:57

[little bit about about this problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m01s)
00:29:01

[here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m07s)
00:29:07

[here is a lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m12s)
00:29:12

[and it is in a dykon viewer back on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m15s)
00:29:15

[I see om is the standard that is used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m20s)
00:29:20

[for sharing most kinds of medical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m23s)
00:29:23

[imaging certainly think again it is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[format which contains two main things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m30s)
00:29:30

[one is a second images and another is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m34s)
00:29:34

[some metadata so that metadata will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m38s)
00:29:38

[things like how much of radiation were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m40s)
00:29:40

[those at by and how far away from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[chest with machine and what brand of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[machine wasn't so simple so you can the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m48s)
00:29:48

[most died computers to choose your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m53s)
00:29:53

[scroll wheel to lit through them and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m54s)
00:29:54

[all this is doing is like going from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m57s)
00:29:57

[from top to bottom or from bottom to top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h29m59s)
00:29:59

[and so kind of see what's going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m02s)
00:30:02

[yes I'm rich I'm okay if you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m07s)
00:30:07

[order or en sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m09s)
00:30:09

[yeah so you can you can well actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m12s)
00:30:12

[what I might do I think is more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[interesting is to say well let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m16s)
00:30:16

[actually focus on a bit that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m22s)
00:30:22

[matter to you which is the inside of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[lung is that area here and these little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m25s)
00:30:25

[white dots what's called the vasculature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m30s)
00:30:30

[so all the little vessels and start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m32s)
00:30:32

[going through the lines and as I scroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m34s)
00:30:34

[through please have a look at this sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m36s)
00:30:36

[of dot you'll see that it seems to move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m38s)
00:30:38

[okay see how it's moving and the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m40s)
00:30:40

[it's moving is because it's not a dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

[it's actually a vessel going through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m45s)
00:30:45

[space so it actually looks like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m49s)
00:30:49

[okay and so if you take a slice through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m54s)
00:30:54

[that it looks like lots of dots and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h30m58s)
00:30:58

[as you go through those slices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m01s)
00:31:01

[it looks like they're okay and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m05s)
00:31:05

[eventually we get to the top of the line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m08s)
00:31:08

[and that's why you see eventually it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m09s)
00:31:09

[kind of all goes to white right so I put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m12s)
00:31:12

[the edge basically is the organ and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m15s)
00:31:15

[you can see there are edges on each side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m19s)
00:31:19

[and then it's also bone so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m20s)
00:31:20

[some of you have been looking at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m25s)
00:31:25

[already over the last few weeks and have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m26s)
00:31:26

[often asked Peter how to deal with like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m29s)
00:31:29

[multiple images and what I said each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m32s)
00:31:32

[time is don't think of it as multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m34s)
00:31:34

[images think of it in the way your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m37s)
00:31:37

[daikon viewer can if you have a 3d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m40s)
00:31:40

[button like this one does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m41s)
00:31:41

[that's actually what we're looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m47s)
00:31:47

[and so it's not a bunch of flat images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m48s)
00:31:48

[it's a 3d volume but it just so happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m53s)
00:31:53

[at the default way that most icon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m57s)
00:31:57

[viewers show thing is by a bunch of flat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h31m59s)
00:31:59

[images but it's really important that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m02s)
00:32:02

[you think of it as a 3d volume because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m06s)
00:32:06

[you're looking in this space okay now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m08s)
00:32:08

[what are you looking for in this space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m12s)
00:32:12

[but what you're looking for in order is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m13s)
00:32:13

[you're looking for somebody who has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m16s)
00:32:16

[munching and what something has lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m18s)
00:32:18

[cancer looks like is that somewhere in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m20s)
00:32:20

[this space there is a blob act like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m22s)
00:32:22

[could be roughly spherical blob it could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m26s)
00:32:26

[be pretty small around five mil five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[millimeters is where people start to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[particularly concerned about a block and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m34s)
00:32:34

[so what that means is that for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m37s)
00:32:37

[radiologist as they flick through a scan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m39s)
00:32:39

[like this is that they're looking for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m42s)
00:32:42

[dot which doesn't move but which appears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m44s)
00:32:44

[gets bigger and then disappears that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m48s)
00:32:48

[what a blog looks like okay so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m51s)
00:32:51

[see why radiologists very very very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m55s)
00:32:55

[often miss nodules loss in lines because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h32m58s)
00:32:58

[in all of this area you know you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m03s)
00:33:03

[to have extraordinary vision to be able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m06s)
00:33:06

[to see every little blob of here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m08s)
00:33:08

[then disappear again and remember the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m10s)

[improved chance of survival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m16s)
00:33:16

[and generally speaking when a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m19s)

[they're not looking for nodules they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m24s)
00:33:24

[looking for something else because lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m27s)
00:33:27

[cancer at least in the earlier stages is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m29s)
00:33:29

[a symptomatic doesn't cause you to feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m32s)
00:33:32

[different right so it's like something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m35s)
00:33:35

[that every radiologist has to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m37s)
00:33:37

[thinking about and it looking for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m38s)
00:33:38

[pneumonia or or whatever else so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[the basic idea is that we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m44s)
00:33:44

[try and come up with in the next hour or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m45s)
00:33:45

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m49s)
00:33:49

[so some idea about how would you find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m49s)
00:33:49

[these blocks how do you find these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m52s)
00:33:52

[nodules so each of these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m54s)
00:33:54

[generally is about 512 by 512 by capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h33m57s)
00:33:57

[100 and and each of those and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m02s)
00:34:02

[affirmative a pixel in 3d space is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m08s)
00:34:08

[called a bottle and so Vauxhall simply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m10s)
00:34:10

[means a pixel in 3d space so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[here is rendering a bunch of bottle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m18s)
00:34:18

[each voxel in a CT scan is a 12-bit it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m24s)
00:34:24

[chip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m31s)
00:34:31

[memory serves me correctly and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m33s)
00:34:33

[computer screen can only show age bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m35s)
00:34:35

[of greyscale and furthermore your eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m39s)
00:34:39

[can't necessarily distinguish between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m41s)
00:34:41

[all those grades fell perfectly anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m43s)
00:34:43

[so what every dykes on view provides is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m46s)
00:34:46

[something called a windowing adjustment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m50s)
00:34:50

[so a windowing adjustment come here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m52s)
00:34:52

[the default window which is designed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h34m56s)
00:34:56

[basically map some subset of that 12 bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m00s)
00:35:00

[space through to the screen so that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m03s)
00:35:03

[highlighted 17 and so the units CT scans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m07s)
00:35:07

[you use according some field units and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m11s)
00:35:11

[different certain ranges of Hounsfield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m14s)
00:35:14

[units tell you that something in some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m18s)
00:35:18

[particular part of the body and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m20s)
00:35:20

[can see here that the bone is being with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m23s)
00:35:23

[us so we've selected an image window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m26s)
00:35:26

[which is designed to allow us to see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m28s)
00:35:28

[bone chilling so what I did when I open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m31s)
00:35:31

[this without switched it to CTS chest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m35s)
00:35:35

[which is some kind person has already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m38s)
00:35:38

[figured out what the best window is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m41s)
00:35:41

[a message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m46s)
00:35:46

[ah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m49s)
00:35:49

[and there's also a city lunch to figured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m52s)
00:35:52

[out what's the best window to see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m58s)
00:35:58

[modules and best butchering well now are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[you working in with deep learning you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m03s)
00:36:03

[don't have to care about that because of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m06s)
00:36:06

[course to take learning algorithm can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m07s)
00:36:07

[see 12 is perfectly well so nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m09s)
00:36:09

[really to worry about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m13s)
00:36:13

[so one of the challenges dealing with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m16s)
00:36:16

[this zone data science called data is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m20s)
00:36:20

[that there's a lot of people assessing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m24s)
00:36:24

[to do but the good news is that there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m25s)
00:36:25

[a couple of fantastic tutorials so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[hopefully you found out by now that I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m34s)

[show you some of these pieces so DICOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h36m57s)
00:36:57

[you will load with with some library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m02s)
00:37:02

[probably with pie diagram and so pie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m07s)
00:37:07

[diagram is a library that's kind of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m09s)
00:37:09

[bit like killer pillow or Gopa or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m11s)
00:37:11

[know an image to open like a Ticonderoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m14s)
00:37:14

[and end up with a 3d file and of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m16s)
00:37:16

[the metadata you can see here using the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m21s)

[metadata image position lights location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[okay so the metadata comes through with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m30s)
00:37:30

[just attributes of the Python object and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m32s)
00:37:32

[this person is very kindly provided to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m37s)

[you a list of the Hounsfield unit arts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m39s)
00:37:39

[is coming from wikipedia Hounsfield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m44s)
00:37:44

[units for each of the different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m46s)
00:37:46

[substances okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m48s)
00:37:48

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[shows how to translate stuff into that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m55s)
00:37:55

[range and so it's great to draw lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h37m57s)
00:37:57

[pictures so here is a histogram for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m01s)
00:38:01

[particular picture alright so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m05s)
00:38:05

[see that most of it is air and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[can some bone in someone at position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m10s)
00:38:10

[flex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m14s)
00:38:14

[so then the next thing to think about is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[the the books really boxful spacing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m22s)
00:38:22

[which is as you move across one bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m27s)

[things about edible imaging is two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m40s)

00:38:42

[distances between those licensed places](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m44s)
00:38:44

[or the slice thickness and different the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m47s)
00:38:47

[different meanings of the x and y-axes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m50s)
00:38:50

[luckily that stuff's all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m53s)
00:38:53

[blacktron metadata so the resampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m55s)
00:38:55

[process means taking that those lists of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h38m57s)
00:38:57

[slices and turning it into something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m02s)
00:39:02

[where every step in the x direction or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m04s)
00:39:04

[the Y direction or the Z direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m06s)
00:39:06

[equals one millimeter in the real world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m08s)
00:39:08

[and so it'd be very annoying for your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m11s)
00:39:11

[deep learning network if your different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m14s)
00:39:14

[line images was squished by different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m16s)
00:39:16

[amounts especially if you can look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m19s)
00:39:19

[the metadata about how much was being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m21s)
00:39:21

[squished so that's what reads sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m23s)
00:39:23

[does as you can see it's using the slice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m26s)
00:39:26

[thickness and the pixel spacing and to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m28s)
00:39:28

[make it really nice and even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m31s)
00:39:31

[so there are various ways to do 3d pots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m35s)
00:39:35

[and it's always a good idea to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m39s)
00:39:39

[and then something else that people tend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m45s)
00:39:45

[to do is segmentation and depending on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m46s)
00:39:46

[time we may or may not get around to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m51s)
00:39:51

[looking more at segmentation in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m53s)
00:39:53

[part of the course but effectively a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m55s)
00:39:55

[segmentation is just another generative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m56s)
00:39:56

[model at the generative model where you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h39m58s)
00:39:58

[know hopefully somebody's given you some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h40m01s)
00:40:01

[things saying this is London's air and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h40m03s)
00:40:03

[then you build a model that does predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h40m06s)
00:40:06

[for something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h40m08s)
00:40:08

[whole lot of heuristics approaches so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h40m28s)

[segmentation approach now it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h41m12s)
00:41:12

[interesting that they pick unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h41m16s)
00:41:16

[segmentation this is definitely the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h41m17s)

00:41:45

[would be the new winner the new external](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h41m47s)

[competitions when they happen but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h41m49s)
00:41:49

[basic idea here of things like you net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[and dense net is that we have a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h41m56s)
00:41:56

[where maybe a controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m00s)
00:42:00

[you know when we do generative models we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m08s)
00:42:08

[I think about doing a style transfers we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m12s)
00:42:12

[generally start with this kind of large](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m15s)
00:42:15

[image and then we do some down sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m17s)
00:42:17

[operations because a small image and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m19s)
00:42:19

[then we do some computation and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m21s)
00:42:21

[make a bigger again as these up sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m25s)
00:42:25

[operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[what happens in you net is that there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m32s)
00:42:32

[are additional neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m37s)

00:42:42

[get it here and get it here and both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m46s)
00:42:46

[connections basically allow it to almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m52s)
00:42:52

[through like a kind of a residual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m57s)
00:42:57

[learning approach like it can figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h42m59s)
00:42:59

[the key pieces you know kind of semantic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m01s)
00:43:01

[pieces at the very low resolution but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m04s)
00:43:04

[then is it up scaled it it can learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m06s)
00:43:06

[well what was special about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m08s)
00:43:08

[difference between the down sampled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m10s)

[image and the original image here they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m12s)
00:43:12

[can kind of learn to add that additional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m13s)
00:43:13

[detail at each point so unit and depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m17s)

00:43:24

[or segmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m26s)
00:43:26

[really interesting and I hope we find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m31s)
00:43:31

[some time to get back to them in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m33s)
00:43:33

[part of the course but if we don't you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m36s)
00:43:36

[can get started by looking at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m40s)

[tutorial in which these folks basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m41s)
00:43:41

[show you from scratch and what they try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[to do in this tutorial is something very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m47s)
00:43:47

[specific which is the detection part so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m49s)
00:43:49

[what happens in this kind of like think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m55s)
00:43:55

[about the fisheries competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h43m59s)
00:43:59

[we've pretty much decided that in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m01s)
00:44:01

[fisheries competition if you wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m03s)
00:44:03

[do really well you would first of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m04s)
00:44:04

[find the fish and then you would zoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m06s)
00:44:06

[into the fish and then you would figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m08s)
00:44:08

[out what kind of fish it is certainly in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[the right way or competition earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[that would tell that was fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m14s)
00:44:14

[but this competition is even more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m17s)
00:44:17

[clearly going to be the approach because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m18s)
00:44:18

[these images are just far too big to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m20s)
00:44:20

[normal convolutional neural network when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m23s)
00:44:23

[is one set is going to find the module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m25s)
00:44:25

[and then the second step that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m27s)
00:44:27

[zoom in to a possible module and figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m29s)
00:44:29

[out is this a malignant tumor or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m32s)
00:44:32

[something else the false positives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m36s)
00:44:36

[the bad news is that the data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m42s)

[Bowl data set does not give you any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m44s)

[nodules which actually wrote a post in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m54s)
00:44:54

[the cable forums about this I just think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[this is a terrible terrible idea because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h44m58s)
00:44:58

[you know they're not like set that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m01s)
00:45:01

[information actually exists that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m03s)
00:45:03

[data set they got the trauma is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m05s)
00:45:05

[something called the National lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m06s)

[screening trial which actually has that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m08s)
00:45:08

[information but something pretty close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m10s)
00:45:10

[to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m11s)
00:45:11

[so the fact they didn't provide it is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m12s)
00:45:12

[just think it's horrible you know for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m15s)
00:45:15

[competition which which can save lives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m17s)
00:45:17

[and a comic information the good news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m19s)
00:45:19

[though is that there is a data set which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m23s)
00:45:23

[does have this information the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m26s)
00:45:26

[data set was called libc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m29s)
00:45:29

[entry ID III interestingly that data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m32s)
00:45:32

[was recently used for another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m36s)

[competition on cable competition called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m38s)
00:45:38

[Luna Oh DNA that competition is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m41s)
00:45:41

[finished and one of the tracks in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m44s)
00:45:44

[competition was actually a specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m47s)
00:45:47

[a false positive detection track so and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m49s)
00:45:49

[then the other track was a find a nodule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m53s)
00:45:53

[track basically so you can actually go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m55s)
00:45:55

[back and look at the papers written by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h45m58s)
00:45:58

[the winners and they're generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m01s)
00:46:01

[ridiculously short many of them are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m02s)
00:46:02

[single sentence saying commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m04s)

[confidentiality agreement we can't do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m07s)
00:46:07

[anything but some of them including the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m09s)
00:46:09

[winner of the false positive track is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m11s)
00:46:11

[film they actually provided not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m14s)
00:46:14

[surprisingly though you're using wording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[and so what you could do is that I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m19s)
00:46:19

[what you have to do to do well in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m22s)
00:46:22

[competition is download the lunar data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m24s)
00:46:24

[set use that to build a nodule detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m26s)
00:46:26

[algorithm so the lunar data set includes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m29s)
00:46:29

[you know files saying this lung has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m32s)
00:46:32

[nodules here here here and here and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m35s)
00:46:35

[do not your protection based on that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m37s)
00:46:37

[then run that nodule detection algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m39s)
00:46:39

[on the cattle data set find the nodules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m42s)
00:46:42

[and then use that do some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m46s)
00:46:46

[location you there are some tricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[things with that the biggest tricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m53s)
00:46:53

[thing is that most of the CT scans in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h46m55s)
00:46:55

[the lunar data set are what's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m01s)
00:47:01

[contrast studies a contrast scan means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m04s)
00:47:04

[that the patient had a radioactive dye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m09s)
00:47:09

[injected into them so that the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m12s)
00:47:12

[that they're looking for idea dizzy the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m15s)
00:47:15

[filter for the National lung screening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m20s)
00:47:20

[trial which is what these mechanical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m22s)
00:47:22

[data set none of them is contrast and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m24s)
00:47:24

[the reason why is that what we really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m27s)
00:47:27

[want to be able to do is to take anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m29s)

[years and give them all a CT scan and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m35s)
00:47:35

[find out which ones of cancer but in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m37s)

[process we don't want to be shooting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m40s)

[them up with radioactive dye and giving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m41s)

[them cancer so that's why we try to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h47m43s)

[so this is a interesting idea of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h49m45s)
00:49:45

[how can you find nodules using more of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h49m51s)

00:49:57

[going to dig into this in some detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m04s)
00:50:04

[because I think this is a great idea for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m06s)

00:50:11

[learning work in in different areas the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m13s)
00:50:13

[basic idea here is to as you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m16s)
00:50:16

[they call it a five dimensional mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m20s)
00:50:20

[they're going to try and find groups of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m22s)
00:50:22

[boxes which are similar and they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m25s)
00:50:25

[going to cluster them together and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m27s)
00:50:27

[hopefully we're going to particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m28s)
00:50:28

[cluster together thing to look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[nodules so the idea is at the end of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[this segmentation then there will be one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m35s)
00:50:35

[cluster for the whole lung boundary one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m37s)
00:50:37

[cluster for the whole vasculature and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m41s)
00:50:41

[then one cluster therapy nodule so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m43s)
00:50:43

[five dimensions are x y&amp;z the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m46s)
00:50:46

[straightforward intensity so is number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m49s)
00:50:49

[of counts field units and then the fifth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[one is volumetric shape index and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m54s)
00:50:54

[is the one tricky one the basic idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h50m58s)
00:50:58

[here is going to be a combination of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m02s)
00:51:02

[different curvatures of a voxel based on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m04s)
00:51:04

[the Gaussian and main curvatures now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[what the paper goes on to explain is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m11s)
00:51:11

[that you can use for these the first and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[second derivatives of the image now all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m18s)
00:51:18

[that basically means is you subtract one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[voxel from it's never right and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m23s)
00:51:23

[take that whole thing and subtract one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m26s)
00:51:26

[box full version of that we get Slater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m28s)
00:51:28

[you get the first and second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m30s)
00:51:30

[derivatives I kind of just help you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m32s)
00:51:32

[direction of the change is image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m35s)
00:51:35

[intensity at that point so by getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m40s)
00:51:40

[these first and second derivatives of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m44s)
00:51:44

[the image and then you put it into this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m46s)
00:51:46

[formula it comes out with something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m47s)
00:51:47

[which basically tells you how fear like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m50s)
00:51:50

[this voxels seems to be part of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m54s)
00:51:54

[sort of house to fear like a construct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h51m58s)
00:51:58

[and so so that's great right if we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h52m00s)
00:52:00

[basically take for the voxels and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h52m03s)
00:52:03

[combine the one for the nearby at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h52m05s)

[similar number of pounds for your units](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h52m08s)
00:52:08

[and seem to be a similar kind of shapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h52m10s)
00:52:10

[we're going to get what we want so I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h52m12s)

[unsupervised learning algorithms which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m10s)

[always tend to be kind of looking for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m13s)

[problem to solve but I realized recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m14s)

[there are some specific problems that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m17s)
00:53:17

[can be solved well with them and I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m18s)

[going to be showing you a couple one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m21s)
00:53:21

[today and when I'm less important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[clustering algorithms are perhaps the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m27s)
00:53:27

[best it is to describe by what they do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m29s)
00:53:29

[by generating some data to show them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m31s)
00:53:31

[against and generated data but I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m34s)
00:53:34

[to create two clusters and for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m36s)
00:53:36

[cluster of 250 samples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m39s)
00:53:39

[so I'm going to basically say okay let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m42s)
00:53:42

[create a bunch of centroids by creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m45s)
00:53:45

[two random numbers so six pairs of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m47s)
00:53:47

[random numbers and centroids and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m50s)
00:53:50

[I'll grab a bunch of random numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m56s)
00:53:56

[around each of those centroids and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h53m59s)
00:53:59

[combine them all together and then plot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m01s)
00:54:01

[them and so here you can see each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m04s)
00:54:04

[these X is representative centroid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m07s)
00:54:07

[okay so attempt Reuters just like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m10s)
00:54:10

[average point for a cluster of data and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m12s)
00:54:12

[each color represents one cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m16s)
00:54:16

[so imagine if this was showing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m20s)
00:54:20

[clusterings of different kinds of lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m26s)
00:54:26

[tissue you know ideally you had some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m30s)
00:54:30

[voxels that were colored one thing for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m33s)
00:54:33

[nodule and a bunch of that thing look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m36s)
00:54:36

[color a different color for vasculature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m38s)
00:54:38

[and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m39s)
00:54:39

[we can only show this easily in two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m43s)
00:54:43

[dimensions but there's no reason to not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m45s)
00:54:45

[be able to imagine doing this in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m48s)
00:54:48

[certainly five dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m49s)
00:54:49

[so the goal of clustering will be to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m52s)
00:54:52

[undo this right given the data but not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m54s)
00:54:54

[the answers how can you figure out where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h54m58s)
00:54:58

[the exes were right so basically and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m01s)
00:55:01

[then it's pretty straightforward once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m04s)
00:55:04

[you know where the exes are to then find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m06s)
00:55:06

[the closest points to that to assign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m08s)
00:55:08

[every data point to a cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m09s)
00:55:09

[the most popular approach to clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m15s)
00:55:15

[is called a means hang mean is an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m18s)
00:55:18

[approach where you have to decide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m25s)
00:55:25

[upfront how many clusters are there and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m27s)
00:55:27

[what it basically does is there's two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m31s)
00:55:31

[steps the first one is to guess as to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m35s)
00:55:35

[where those clusters might be a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m39s)
00:55:39

[simple way to do that is just to some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m42s)
00:55:42

[wonderful pictures and on the simple way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m44s)
00:55:44

[to do that is basically to randomly pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[a point and then start randomly picking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[points which are as far away as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m54s)
00:55:54

[from all the previous ones okay so if a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h55m58s)
00:55:58

[literal where the first one so if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m02s)
00:56:02

[started here right then probably the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m04s)
00:56:04

[farthest away point would be down here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m06s)
00:56:06

[but this would be like our starting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m08s)
00:56:08

[point for cluster one I would say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m10s)
00:56:10

[what point is furthest away from that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m12s)
00:56:12

[that's probably this one here at the VLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m14s)
00:56:14

[in 2022 okay what's the furthest point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m16s)
00:56:16

[away from both of these probably what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m19s)
00:56:19

[this one over here and so forth so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m21s)
00:56:21

[keep doing that to get your initial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m23s)
00:56:23

[point and then you just iteratively move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m25s)
00:56:25

[every point so basically then say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m30s)
00:56:30

[which these are the clusters that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m33s)
00:56:33

[two massive clusters which cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m34s)
00:56:34

[delivery point belong to and they need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m38s)
00:56:38

[to iteratively move the points to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m40s)
00:56:40

[different classes and a bunch of times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m42s)
00:56:42

[now k-means it's a shame it's so popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m45s)
00:56:45

[because it kind of sucks right so sucky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m50s)
00:56:50

[thing number one is that we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m54s)
00:56:54

[decide how many classes there are and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m57s)
00:56:57

[like the whole points they don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h56m59s)
00:56:59

[how many modules there are right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m00s)
00:57:00

[then thing number two is without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m03s)
00:57:03

[some changes to do thing called kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m05s)
00:57:05

[k-means it only works if the things are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m07s)
00:57:07

[the same shape you know they're all kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m10s)
00:57:10

[of nicely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m12s)
00:57:12

[gasping so we're going to talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m13s)
00:57:13

[about something way cooler which only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m16s)
00:57:16

[we're kind of came across someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m19s)
00:57:19

[recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m20s)
00:57:20

[much Westphal known which is called mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m21s)
00:57:21

[shift classroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m23s)
00:57:23

[now Lynch if clustering is one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m25s)
00:57:25

[things which seems to spend some all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m30s)
00:57:30

[its time in them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m35s)
00:57:35

[and a serious mathematician land like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m39s)
00:57:39

[whatever I try to kind of look up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m43s)
00:57:43

[something about me and ship clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m44s)
00:57:44

[excited that seeing this kind of thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m46s)
00:57:46

[and this is like the first tutorial or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[not in the PDF that I could find so okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[so this is one way to think about engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m56s)
00:57:56

[clustering and other way is a code first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h57m58s)
00:57:58

[approach which is that this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m01s)
00:58:01

[entire algorithm so let's talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m04s)
00:58:04

[what's going on here what are we doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m09s)
00:58:09

[at a high level we're going to do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m12s)
00:58:12

[bunch of loops all right so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m14s)
00:58:14

[to be five steps it would be better if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m17s)
00:58:17

[didn't do five steps that I kept doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m20s)
00:58:20

[this until it was stable but for now I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m22s)
00:58:22

[going to do both this and each step I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m24s)
00:58:24

[going to go through so our data is X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m27s)
00:58:27

[right I'm going to go through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m29s)
00:58:29

[numerator to our data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m32s)
00:58:32

[and what I'm going to do is I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m34s)
00:58:34

[find okay so a small X is the current](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m37s)
00:58:37

[data point I'm looking at okay now what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m39s)
00:58:39

[I'm going to do is find out how far away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m42s)
00:58:42

[is this data point from every other data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m43s)
00:58:43

[plant but I'm going to create a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m46s)
00:58:46

[of distances and I'm going to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[with the magic of broadcasting okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m51s)
00:58:51

[small X is a vector of size two just is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m55s)
00:58:55

[two coordinates and big X is a blank of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h58m59s)
00:58:59

[site as a matrix of size n by 2 where n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m03s)
00:59:03

[is the request and thanks to what we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m07s)
00:59:07

[now learned about broadcasting we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[that we could subtract a matrix from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m11s)
00:59:11

[vector and that vector will be broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m13s)
00:59:13

[across the axis of the matrix and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m16s)
00:59:16

[this is going to subtract every element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[of big apps from little air and so if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m21s)
00:59:21

[then go ahead and square that and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m25s)
00:59:25

[sum it up and then take the square root](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[this is going to return a vector of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m32s)
00:59:32

[distances of small X to every element of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[B X ok and with the thought the sum here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m40s)
00:59:40

[is just summing up for two coordinates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m45s)
00:59:45

[okay so that's step one so we now know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m50s)
00:59:50

[for this particular data point how far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m52s)
00:59:52

[away is it from all of the other data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m54s)
00:59:54

[points now the next thing we want to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m56s)
00:59:56

[is to the fight walk let's go to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=00h59m59s)
00:59:59

[final step the final step will be to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m03s)
01:00:03

[take a weighted average right so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[basically can add in the final step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m07s)
01:00:07

[we're going to say what cluster do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m09s)
01:00:09

[belong to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m12s)
01:00:12

[let's draw this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m13s)
01:00:13

[okay so got a whole bunch of data points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m21s)
01:00:21

[and we're currently looking at this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m31s)
01:00:31

[and what we've done is we've now got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m33s)
01:00:33

[list of how far is away from or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m35s)
01:00:35

[other data points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m38s)
01:00:38

[and the basic idea is now what we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m43s)
01:00:43

[to do is take the weighted average of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m45s)
01:00:45

[all of those data points weighted by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m49s)
01:00:49

[inverse of that distance so the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m51s)
01:00:51

[that are a long way away we want to wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m54s)
01:00:54

[very small and the things that are very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m57s)
01:00:57

[close we want to work very big right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h00m59s)
01:00:59

[I think this is probably the closest and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m02s)
01:01:02

[this is about the second closest and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m06s)
01:01:06

[this is about the third closest so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m09s)
01:01:09

[achieving this but most of the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m12s)
01:01:12

[the average is going to be somewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m13s)
01:01:13

[about here okay and so by doing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m15s)
01:01:15

[every point we're going to move every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m20s)
01:01:20

[point both fit aware its friends up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m23s)
01:01:23

[folks it aware the nearby thing but and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m26s)
01:01:26

[so if we keep doing it again and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m28s)
01:01:28

[everything's going to move and show us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m30s)
01:01:30

[right next to it friends so how do we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m33s)
01:01:33

[take something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m37s)
01:01:37

[initially is a distance and make it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m39s)
01:01:39

[that the larger distances have smaller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m42s)
01:01:42

[ways and the answer is we probably want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m45s)
01:01:45

[to shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m48s)
01:01:48

[like that in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m52s)
01:01:52

[calcium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m56s)
01:01:56

[this is by no means the only shape you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h01m59s)
01:01:59

[could choose right it would be equally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m01s)
01:02:01

[valid to choose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m04s)
01:02:04

[this shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m08s)
01:02:08

[it's just triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m12s)
01:02:12

[problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m14s)
01:02:14

[in general though look that if we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m17s)
01:02:17

[going to multiply every point by one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m19s)
01:02:19

[these things and add them all together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m23s)
01:02:23

[it'd be nice if all of our weights added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m26s)
01:02:26

[to one right because then we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m29s)
01:02:29

[end up with something that's of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m32s)
01:02:32

[scale that we start with so when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m33s)
01:02:33

[create one of these curves where it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m36s)
01:02:36

[adds up to one generally speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m41s)
01:02:41

[we call that a kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m44s)
01:02:44

[and I mention this because you will see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m49s)
01:02:49

[kernels everywhere if you haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m51s)
01:02:51

[already now that you see that you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m54s)
01:02:54

[them everywhere in fact kernel methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[it's a whole area of machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m01s)
01:03:01

[that in the late 90s basically took over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[because it was so theoretically pure and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m05s)
01:03:05

[if you want to get published in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m08s)
01:03:08

[conference proceedings it's much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m10s)
01:03:10

[important to be theoretically pure than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m11s)
01:03:11

[actually accurate so for a long time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m13s)
01:03:13

[kernel methods one out and neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m17s)
01:03:17

[networks in particular disappeared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[eventually people realize that accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m22s)
01:03:22

[was important as well and more recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m24s)
01:03:24

[times kernel methods are largely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m28s)
01:03:28

[disappearing but you still see the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m30s)
01:03:30

[of a kernel coming up very often because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m33s)
01:03:33

[they're super useful tools to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m36s)
01:03:36

[they're basically something that lets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m38s)
01:03:38

[you take a number or in this case a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m40s)
01:03:40

[distance and turn it into some other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m42s)
01:03:42

[number where you can weight everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m44s)
01:03:44

[by the other number and add them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[together to get a nice little weighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m49s)
01:03:49

[average so in our case we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m50s)
01:03:50

[use a Gaussian kernel the particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m54s)
01:03:54

[formula for a Gaussian doesn't matter I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h03m57s)
01:03:57

[remember learning this formula in grade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m00s)
01:04:00

[10 and it was by far the most terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m03s)
01:04:03

[mathematical formula ever seen but it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m05s)
01:04:05

[doesn't really matter right that's for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m08s)
01:04:08

[those of you that remember or seen the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m10s)
01:04:10

[Gaussian formula you'll recognize it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m12s)
01:04:12

[those of you that haven't it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m14s)
01:04:14

[matter but this is the function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m16s)
01:04:16

[draws that curve ok so if we take every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m19s)
01:04:19

[one of our distances and put it through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m25s)
01:04:25

[the calcium we will then get back a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[bunch of weights that add to 1 ok so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[then in the final step we can multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m35s)
01:04:35

[every one of our data points by that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m38s)
01:04:38

[weight ok add them up and divide by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m41s)
01:04:41

[sum of the weights in other words like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m45s)
01:04:45

[weighted average you'll notice that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m48s)
01:04:48

[had to be a bit careful about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m50s)
01:04:50

[broadcasting here because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m51s)
01:04:51

[needed to add a beautiful accent at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h04m56s)
01:04:56

[end of my dimensions not at the start so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m00s)
01:05:00

[by default it adds to unit axes the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m04s)
01:05:04

[beginning and you do broadcasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m07s)
01:05:07

[that's where has to expand in if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m09s)
01:05:09

[not clear on why this is then that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m13s)
01:05:13

[sign you definitely need to do some more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m16s)
01:05:16

[playing around with broadcasting so have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m18s)
01:05:18

[a fiddle with that during the week feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m21s)
01:05:21

[free to ask if you're not clear after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m24s)
01:05:24

[you the experimenters but it is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m25s)
01:05:25

[way to done and so this is just doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m27s)
01:05:27

[some of weights times eggs but base on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[of quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m36s)
01:05:36

[importantly the nice little thing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m41s)
01:05:41

[we can pass to a gaussian which is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m45s)
01:05:45

[thing that decides does it look like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m48s)
01:05:48

[thing I just drew or does it look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m50s)
01:05:50

[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m53s)
01:05:53

[look like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m56s)
01:05:56

[and all of those things add up to one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h05m59s)
01:05:59

[they all have the same area underneath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m00s)
01:06:00

[but they're very different shapes if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m02s)
01:06:02

[make it look like this then what that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m05s)
01:06:05

[going to do is it's going to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m07s)
01:06:07

[lot more clusters but because things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m08s)
01:06:08

[that are really close to it they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m11s)
01:06:11

[going to have really high weights and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m12s)
01:06:12

[everything else is going to have a tiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m14s)
01:06:14

[web and be meaningless or else if we use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m16s)
01:06:16

[something like this we're going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m18s)
01:06:18

[much fewer classes because even stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m21s)
01:06:21

[it's further away going to have a higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m23s)
01:06:23

[weight and when fun so the choice that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m25s)
01:06:25

[you use for the it's called the kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m32s)
01:06:32

[rips as a logical names you can use we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m35s)
01:06:35

[actually prepare up these BW being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m39s)
01:06:39

[banned reads that number there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m41s)
01:06:41

[actually some cool ways to choose it one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m44s)
01:06:44

[simple way to choose it is to find out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[which size of bandwidth covers say one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m50s)
01:06:50

[third of the data in your database I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m55s)
01:06:55

[think that's the approach that on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m57s)
01:06:57

[scikit-learn users so anyway there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h06m59s)
01:06:59

[some ways that you can automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m02s)
01:07:02

[figure out a band ribs I just want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m04s)
01:07:04

[look pretty nice things that I mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[okay so we just go through a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m11s)
01:07:11

[time five times in each time we replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m13s)
01:07:13

[every point with its weighted average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m15s)
01:07:15

[weighted by the this Gaussian kernel and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m22s)
01:07:22

[so when we run this five times it takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m24s)
01:07:24

[the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m28s)
01:07:28

[and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m30s)
01:07:30

[as a result I've upset everything by one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[just so that we can see it right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m34s)
01:07:34

[otherwise it'd be right on property X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m36s)
01:07:36

[you can see that for nearly all of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m37s)
01:07:37

[is it exactly the right spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m40s)
01:07:40

[where else for this cluster let's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[remind ourselves a metatarsal on there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m44s)
01:07:44

[but if these two clusters this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m45s)
01:07:45

[particular band fits is decided to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[create one cluster for them rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m51s)
01:07:51

[two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m54s)
01:07:54

[okay so this is kind of an example where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m54s)
01:07:54

[else if we decreased our band width it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h07m57s)
01:07:57

[would create two classes and I just know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m00s)
01:08:00

[one right answer is there should be one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m02s)
01:08:02

[or two so one challenge for this is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m05s)
01:08:05

[it's kind of slow right so I thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m10s)
01:08:10

[let's try and accelerate it to the GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m15s)
01:08:15

[okay and because then shifts not very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m18s)
01:08:18

[cool nobody seems to implement the TPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m22s)
01:08:22

[yet or maybe this a little bit here so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m25s)
01:08:25

[thought oh geez PI torch and the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m28s)
01:08:28

[why you'd play torch is because it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m31s)
01:08:31

[really feels like writing PI talks just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m32s)
01:08:32

[feels like writing 9 pi everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m34s)
01:08:34

[happens straight away so I really hoped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m36s)
01:08:36

[that I could take my original code and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m38s)
01:08:38

[make it almost the same and indeed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m43s)
01:08:43

[is the entirety of main shift in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m46s)
01:08:46

[Patchogue so that's pretty cool you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m51s)
01:08:51

[see rather than you know anywhere they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m55s)
01:08:55

[used to have NP and numbers torch NP dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h08m57s)
01:08:57

[array is now forged off flow tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m01s)
01:09:01

[and video square root is torture square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m05s)
01:09:05

[root](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m07s)
01:09:07

[everything else is almost the same and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m08s)
01:09:08

[one issue is that torch doesn't support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m10s)
01:09:10

[broadcasting so we'll talk more about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m14s)
01:09:14

[this shortly in a couple of weeks but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[basically I decided that smell okay so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m21s)

[wrote my own broadcasting library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m23s)
01:09:23

[package so this rather than saying X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m25s)
01:09:25

[little X minus big X I use subs for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m28s)
01:09:28

[tract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m30s)
01:09:30

[that's the subtract from my broadcasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m31s)
01:09:31

[library if you're curious and check out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m33s)
01:09:33

[for two tools as you can see my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m36s)
01:09:36

[broadcasting operations there but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m37s)
01:09:37

[basically if you use those you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m40s)
01:09:40

[saves the multiplication it'll do all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m42s)
01:09:42

[the broadcasting point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m45s)
01:09:45

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m47s)
01:09:47

[okay so as you can see this box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[basically identical to the previous code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m54s)
01:09:54

[fire takes longer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h09m58s)
01:09:58

[so that's not ideal one problem here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m01s)
01:10:01

[that I'm not using Kudo okay so I could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m05s)
01:10:05

[easily fix that by adding CUDA my ex but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m08s)
01:10:08

[that made it slower still and the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[why is that other works being done in is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m16s)
01:10:16

[for loop and height which doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m18s)
01:10:18

[accelerate for loops by each run through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m22s)
01:10:22

[a for loop in pi torch is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m25s)
01:10:25

[doing is basically calling a new CUDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m28s)
01:10:28

[kernel each time you're going through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m32s)
01:10:32

[and it takes a certain amount of time to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m33s)
01:10:33

[even launched a CUDA kernel this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m35s)
01:10:35

[rather annoying sorry when I was in CUDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m40s)
01:10:40

[kernel this is a different history of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m42s)
01:10:42

[work kernel in CUDA kernel refers to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m43s)
01:10:43

[little piece of code that runs on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m47s)
01:10:47

[GPU so it's launching a little GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m49s)
01:10:49

[process every time through the for loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m52s)
01:10:52

[is takes quite a time and it's also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m54s)
01:10:54

[having to copy they don't all over the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m57s)
01:10:57

[place so but I guess the right result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h10m58s)
01:10:58

[sounds good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m03s)
01:11:03

[so what I then tried to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m04s)
01:11:04

[was to make it faster the trick is to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m09s)
01:11:09

[it by mini-batch okay so each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m15s)
01:11:15

[through the loop we want to don't want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[to do just one big data but a mini batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m20s)
01:11:20

[of data so here's the changes I mean the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m26s)
01:11:26

[main one was that my fly now jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m31s)
01:11:31

[through one batch size at a time okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m35s)
01:11:35

[I'm going to go not not 1 2 3 but not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m39s)
01:11:39

[1632 ok so I now need to create a slice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[which is from i to i plus batch size and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m48s)
01:11:48

[let me contrast the end of the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m57s)
01:11:57

[which case is justified then ok so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h11m59s)
01:11:59

[is going to refer to the slice of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m02s)
01:12:02

[that we're interested in so what we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[now do is say X with that slaves to crap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m08s)
01:12:08

[back all of the data in this mini bash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m11s)
01:12:11

[and so then I had to create a special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m15s)
01:12:15

[version of I can't say subtract anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m17s)
01:12:17

[I need to think carefully about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m21s)
01:12:21

[broadcasting operations here having a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m23s)
01:12:23

[return of matrix that lets say batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m25s)
01:12:25

[size of 32 are going to have 32 rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m27s)
01:12:27

[okay and then let's say n is a thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[will be a thousand columns that shows me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m33s)
01:12:33

[how far away each thing in my batch is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m35s)
01:12:35

[from every piece of data so when we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m37s)
01:12:37

[things a batch of the time you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m41s)
01:12:41

[basically adding another access to all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m43s)
01:12:43

[of your senses certainly now you have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m46s)
01:12:46

[batch asses all the sounds and we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m48s)
01:12:48

[been doing deep learning that's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m51s)
01:12:51

[like something I think we've got pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m53s)
01:12:53

[used to write the first access and all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m54s)
01:12:54

[of our tenses or has been a batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m57s)
01:12:57

[shatters but now we're writing our own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h12m59s)
01:12:59

[gpu-accelerated algorithm now can you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m01s)
01:13:01

[believe how crazy this is like two years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m04s)
01:13:04

[ago writing a GT like if you google for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[like k-means food or payment GPU you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m10s)
01:13:10

[back like research done but if iraq keen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m14s)
01:13:14

[turns about how to put these algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m17s)
01:13:17

[you can use because like it was hard and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m19s)
01:13:19

[here's a page of code the dozen so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m23s)
01:13:23

[this is crazy this is possible where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m27s)
01:13:27

[are we have built a a batch by batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m29s)
01:13:29

[gpu-accelerated been shipped algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m34s)
01:13:34

[so the basic distance formula is exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m36s)
01:13:36

[the same i just have to be careful about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m40s)
01:13:40

[where I added unsquare as the same as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m42s)
01:13:42

[expand in in vampire so let's be careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m45s)
01:13:45

[about where I add my univac these add up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m49s)
01:13:49

[to the first axis of one bit and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m51s)
01:13:51

[second axis of the other dish that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m54s)
01:13:54

[going to do like a subtract every one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m55s)
01:13:55

[the each and every one of them's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[paternal matrix again this is like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h13m59s)
01:13:59

[really good time to look at this and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[think why does this Broadcasting work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m07s)
01:14:07

[because this is getting more and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m10s)
01:14:10

[complex broadcasting and hopefully you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m12s)
01:14:12

[can now see the value of broadcasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m16s)
01:14:16

[right not only did I get to avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m17s)
01:14:17

[writing a pair of nested for-loops here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m21s)
01:14:21

[but I also got to do this all on the GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m25s)
01:14:25

[in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m28s)
01:14:28

[operation so I've made this south of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m28s)
01:14:28

[time about that some so here is a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m32s)
01:14:32

[operation which does that entire matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m36s)
01:14:36

[in subjection this ritual is just going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m38s)
01:14:38

[to suggest that we take a break to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m42s)
01:14:42

[depend too late](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m43s)
01:14:43

[so so that's our batch wise distance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m48s)
01:14:48

[function we then check that into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m53s)
01:14:53

[Gaussian and because this is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m55s)
01:14:55

[element wise the Gaussian function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h14m57s)
01:14:57

[hasn't changed at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m00s)
01:15:00

[that's nice and then I've got my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m01s)
01:15:01

[weighted sum and then divide that by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m05s)
01:15:05

[sum of weights so that's basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[algorithm so previously for my numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m14s)
01:15:14

[version it took a second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m17s)
01:15:17

[now it's 48 milliseconds so we've just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[set it up at 28 yes very John there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m24s)
01:15:24

[question I get how batching helps with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m29s)
01:15:29

[locality in cash but I do not quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m32s)
01:15:32

[follow how it helps otherwise especially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m33s)
01:15:33

[with respect to accelerating the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m36s)
01:15:36

[for-loop yes so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m37s)
01:15:37

[in pi torch the for loop is not run on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m41s)
01:15:41

[the GPU the for loop is run on your CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m45s)
01:15:45

[and your CPU goes through each step of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m49s)
01:15:49

[the for loop and calls the GPU as they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m51s)
01:15:51

[do this thing do this thing do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[thing but so this is not to say you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h15m56s)
01:15:56

[can't accelerate this intensive flow you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m00s)
01:16:00

[know in a similar way like intensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m04s)
01:16:04

[flow there's a TS dot wile and stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m06s)
01:16:06

[like that we've next to do GPU based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[loops even still if you do it entirely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m10s)
01:16:10

[in a liquid paper it's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m15s)
01:16:15

[pretty difficult to get his performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m17s)
01:16:17

[but particularly in PI torch important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m18s)
01:16:18

[remember in PI torch your loops are not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m21s)
01:16:21

[optimized it's what you do inside each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m23s)
01:16:23

[which is optimized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m25s)
01:16:25

[another question some of the math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m29s)
01:16:29

[functions are coming from torch and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m30s)

[others are coming from the mask Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m32s)

[what is the difference when you use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m35s)
01:16:35

[Python mask library does that mean the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m37s)
01:16:37

[GPU is not being used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m39s)
01:16:39

[yeah so you'll see that I use that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m42s)
01:16:42

[master pi is a constant and then math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m46s)
01:16:46

[dot square root of two times pi is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m49s)
01:16:49

[constant so I don't need to use the GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m51s)
01:16:51

[to have a better constant obviously so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m52s)
01:16:52

[yeah we only use a torch for things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[are running on a vector or a matrix or a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m00s)
01:17:00

[tensor if they don't okay so let's have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m05s)
01:17:05

[a break we'll come back in 10 minutes Oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m10s)
01:17:10

[that'd be too fast H and we'll talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m13s)
01:17:13

[about some ideas I have for improving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m15s)
01:17:15

[mean shift which maybe you guys will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[want to try out during the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[so basically the idea here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m23s)
01:17:23

[we we figure that there are two two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m29s)
01:17:29

[steps we need to figure out whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m31s)
01:17:31

[nodules are good rare whether nodules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[are in something like this if any step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m37s)
01:17:37

[number one is to find the things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m41s)
01:17:41

[maybe kind of nodule ish zoom into them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m43s)
01:17:43

[and create a little cropped version and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m46s)
01:17:46

[then step two would be where your deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m49s)
01:17:49

[learning particularly comes in which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m52s)
01:17:52

[to figure out is that cancerous or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[the once you've found a nodule ish thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h17m57s)
01:17:57

[the the cancerous ones actually buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m02s)
01:18:02

[farther but far the biggest driver of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m05s)
01:18:05

[whether or not something is a moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m08s)
01:18:08

[cancer is how big it is okay so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m11s)
01:18:11

[it's that it's actually pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m14s)
01:18:14

[straightforward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m15s)
01:18:15

[the other thing particularly important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m16s)
01:18:16

[is like how kind of spider II it looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m19s)
01:18:19

[if it looks like it's kind of evilly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m24s)
01:18:24

[going out to capture more territory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m26s)
01:18:26

[that's probably a bad client as well so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m28s)
01:18:28

[the kind of size in the shape for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m32s)
01:18:32

[two things that you got to be wanting to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m34s)
01:18:34

[try and find obviously that's a pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m35s)
01:18:35

[good theme for a neural net to be able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m37s)
01:18:37

[to do you probably don't need that an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m41s)
01:18:41

[example diversion when you get to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m42s)
01:18:42

[point those obviously question about you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m47s)
01:18:47

[know how to deal with the 3d aspect here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m49s)
01:18:49

[and we can just create a 3d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m51s)
01:18:51

[convolutional neural net so if you had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m53s)
01:18:53

[like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h18m58s)
01:18:58

[ten by ten by ten space that's opposite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m01s)
01:19:01

[em and I'm gonna be too big and 20 by 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m03s)
01:19:03

[by 20 you might be okay and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m06s)
01:19:06

[kind of think about how big a volume can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m08s)
01:19:08

[you create and there's plenty of papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m09s)
01:19:09

[around on 3d convolutions although I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m11s)
01:19:11

[not sure if you even need one because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m14s)
01:19:14

[it's just a convolution in 3d the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m16s)
01:19:16

[approach that you might find interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m22s)
01:19:22

[to think about is something called try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m24s)
01:19:24

[planar what try planar means is that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m26s)
01:19:26

[take a slice through the X and the y and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m29s)
01:19:29

[they're a seed and so you basically end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m33s)
01:19:33

[up with three images one is this box XY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m36s)
01:19:36

[is that and then you can go treat those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m40s)
01:19:40

[as different channels if you like even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m42s)
01:19:42

[and probably use pretty standard here on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m45s)
01:19:45

[that library that expect your channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m50s)
01:19:50

[so there's a couple of ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m52s)
01:19:52

[how you can do on the 3d there's others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h19m57s)
01:19:57

[the I think using this Luna that have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[said as much as possible is going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m06s)
01:20:06

[good idea because you really want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m08s)
01:20:08

[something that's pretty good at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m09s)
01:20:09

[detecting modules before you start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m10s)
01:20:10

[putting it on to the capital data second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m13s)
01:20:13

[the other problem with the Cobra dataset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m14s)
01:20:14

[is it's ridiculously small and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m16s)
01:20:16

[there's no reason for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m19s)
01:20:19

[okay run far more cases in NL s cheese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[and they provide us a cattle so I can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m24s)
01:20:24

[begin to imagine why they went to all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m26s)
01:20:26

[this trouble and a million dollars of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m28s)
01:20:28

[money for something which is not being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m30s)
01:20:30

[set up to succeed anyway that's not our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m33s)
01:20:33

[problem it makes it all the more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m36s)
01:20:36

[interesting thing to play with but you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m38s)
01:20:38

[know after the competition's finished if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m43s)
01:20:43

[you get interested in it you'll probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m45s)
01:20:45

[want to go and download the hole in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m47s)

[Illinois C data set or as much as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m48s)
01:20:48

[possible and do it properly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m51s)
01:20:51

[initially there are two questions that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m55s)
01:20:55

[oat that I wanted to read one is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h20m57s)

[one-inch system for the audio stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h21m01s)
01:21:01

[there are occasional max volume pops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h21m03s)
01:21:03

[that are really hard on the ears for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h21m05s)
01:21:05

[remote listeners this might not be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h21m07s)
01:21:07

[solvable right now but something to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h21m10s)
01:21:10

[into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h21m11s)
01:21:11

[okay and and then someone asked last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h21m14s)
01:21:14

[class you mentioned that you would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h21m18s)

[let us know that help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h21m39s)

[them so the question is how do we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h24m03s)
01:24:03

[quickly find the ones to assure a long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h24m09s)

[way away and we know the answer to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h24m12s)
01:24:12

[remember its approximate nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h24m17s)
01:24:17

[neighbors so what if we added an extra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h24m20s)
01:24:20

[step here which rather than using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h24m24s)

[ones that actually are going to matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h24m42s)
01:24:42

[so that would basically turn this linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h24m45s)

[which would be pretty fantastic so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h24m58s)
01:24:58

[learnt very briefly about a particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[approach which is locality-sensitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h25m04s)

[hashing I think I mentioned also there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h25m06s)

[of of bill trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h25m11s)

01:25:39

[really big deal so if anybody is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h25m40s)
01:25:40

[interested in doing that I believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h25m44s)

[in base and once you've done that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h25m51s)
01:25:51

[should be totally trivial to add the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h25m56s)
01:25:56

[steps that then uses that here so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h25m58s)
01:25:58

[do that then you know if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m01s)
01:26:01

[interested I would invite you to team up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m03s)

[with me and that we would then release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m06s)

[this piece of software together and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m08s)
01:26:08

[author a paper or a postage together so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m10s)
01:26:10

[that's my hope is that one of you or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m14s)

[group of you will make that happen that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m17s)
01:26:17

[would be super exciting because I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m19s)
01:26:19

[this would be great you know like it if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m21s)

[know it used to be so much work this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m43s)
01:26:43

[without even including any kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m47s)

[approximate nearest neighbor speeds or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m48s)
01:26:48

[whatever so I think it's be great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m50s)
01:26:50

[so hopefully that will happen okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m54s)
01:26:54

[and look at get the right answer about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m57s)
01:26:57

[that I get to do it properly we should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h26m59s)
01:26:59

[also be replacing the Gaussian kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h27m01s)

[and Ritz with something that we figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h27m05s)

[we'll take this with a grain of salt as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h29m17s)

[though these introduced to Bobby tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h29m20s)

[a query to which there is an answer so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h29m48s)
01:29:48

[the sentences are ordered in time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h29m52s)

[okay - Daniel is in the bathroom so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m03s)
01:30:03

[is what the very task lovely there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m06s)
01:30:06

[number of kind of different structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m08s)
01:30:08

[this is called a one supporting set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m11s)
01:30:11

[structure which is to say you only have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m14s)
01:30:14

[to go back and find one sentence in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m17s)

[stories which is one where you're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m23s)
01:30:23

[to have to look twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m25s)
01:30:25

[so the breeding ends of the datasets is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m30s)
01:30:30

[not remotely interesting this is a text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m35s)

[file we can pass them out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[so it's various different text files for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m42s)
01:30:42

[the various different tasks and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m45s)
01:30:45

[you're interested in the various](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m47s)

[paper we're going to be looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m49s)
01:30:49

[single supporting fact and true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m52s)
01:30:52

[supporting facts they have some with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m53s)
01:30:53

[10,000 examples and some with 1,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m55s)
01:30:55

[examples and the goal is to be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h30m58s)
01:30:58

[solve every one of their challenges with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h31m03s)
01:31:03

[just a bad example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h31m05s)
01:31:05

[and this paper is not successful that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h31m08s)
01:31:08

[goal but it yes some movement towards it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h31m10s)
01:31:10

[so basically we're going to put that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h31m16s)
01:31:16

[into a bunch of different lists of lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h31m21s)

[of stories along with their queries and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h31m25s)
01:31:25

[we can start off by having a look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h31m29s)

[look at the gift but it says read story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h31m45s)

[showed us that they took a story and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h32m27s)

[summarize a lot of the range of major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h32m30s)

[plot points and ask various questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h32m32s)
01:32:32

[and clearly that's not entirely true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h32m37s)
01:32:37

[like what they did like if you look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h32m39s)

01:33:00

01:33:20

[we need to turn it into a tensor in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m22s)
01:33:22

[which everything is the same size so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m25s)
01:33:25

[use Patsey concerns for that like we did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m28s)
01:33:28

[in the last part of the course which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m31s)
01:33:31

[will add zeros to make sure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m35s)
01:33:35

[everything is the same size so the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m37s)
01:33:37

[thing we'll do is we will create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m40s)
01:33:40

[dictionary from words to integers to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m43s)
01:33:43

[turn every word into an index so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m46s)
01:33:46

[going to turn every word into an index](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m49s)
01:33:49

[and then Pat them so that they're all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m50s)
01:33:50

[the same length and then that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m53s)
01:33:53

[give us input strain 10,000 stories each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h33m57s)
01:33:57

[one of ten sentences each one of eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m03s)
01:34:03

[words and anything that's not ten tenten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m07s)
01:34:07

[Islam is going to get sentences such as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m10s)
01:34:10

[zeros any tensions is not eight words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m12s)
01:34:12

[long we get some zeros appended to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m15s)
01:34:15

[and you'd over the text we're just going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m17s)
01:34:17

[to thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m20s)
01:34:20

[okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[how do we do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m25s)
01:34:25

[not surprisingly we're going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m28s)
01:34:28

[embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m29s)
01:34:29

[now we have to we've ever done this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m33s)
01:34:33

[before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m36s)
01:34:36

[we have to turn a sentence into anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m37s)
01:34:37

[it's not just a word infinite bearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m40s)
01:34:40

[so there's lots of interesting ways of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m44s)
01:34:44

[turning attention gentlemen betting but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m46s)
01:34:46

[when you're just doing towards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m50s)
01:34:50

[intelligent AI you don't do any of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m51s)
01:34:51

[you insert just at the embeddings up and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m53s)
01:34:53

[that's what happened in this paper okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m56s)
01:34:56

[and if you look at like the way it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h34m58s)
01:34:58

[set up you can see why you can just add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m00s)
01:35:00

[the embeddings up marry John and Sandra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m02s)
01:35:02

[like they only ever appear in one place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m06s)
01:35:06

[they're always the object of this you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m08s)
01:35:08

[know the verb is always the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m10s)
01:35:10

[that prepositions are always meaningless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m12s)
01:35:12

[and the last word is always placed right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m14s)
01:35:14

[so you know to figure out what a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m15s)
01:35:15

[sentence says you can just add up the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m19s)
01:35:19

[work concepts the order of them doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m21s)
01:35:21

[make any difference there's no not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m23s)
01:35:23

[there's nothing that makes language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m24s)
01:35:24

[there might be complicated or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m26s)
01:35:26

[interesting so what we're going to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m27s)
01:35:27

[we're going to create an input for our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m30s)
01:35:30

[stories with number of sentences and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m32s)
01:35:32

[length of each one we're going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m35s)
01:35:35

[each word and put it through an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m38s)
01:35:38

[embedding so that's what time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m40s)
01:35:40

[distributed is doing here okay it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m41s)
01:35:41

[putting each word through a separate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m43s)
01:35:43

[embedding and then we do a lambda layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m45s)
01:35:45

[through ESMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m48s)
01:35:48

[okay so here is a very sophisticated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m51s)
01:35:51

[approach to creating sentence and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m53s)
01:35:53

[visions so we do that for our story so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h35m55s)
01:35:55

[we end up with something which rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m00s)
01:36:00

[than being 10 by H ie 10 sentences like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m03s)
01:36:03

[Edwards is now 10 by 20 that is 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m06s)
01:36:06

[sentences by length 20 and B each one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m10s)
01:36:10

[our 10 sentences has been turned into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m15s)
01:36:15

[length 20 inventing and we're just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m17s)
01:36:17

[starting with a random and then we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m18s)
01:36:18

[not going to use word to that for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m20s)
01:36:20

[anything because there's nothing we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m21s)
01:36:21

[don't need the complexity of that but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m23s)
01:36:23

[every model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m26s)
01:36:26

[we're going to do exactly the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m29s)
01:36:29

[for the query okay we don't do to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m30s)
01:36:30

[time distributed this time so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m32s)
01:36:32

[just take the query because this time we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m37s)
01:36:37

[have just one query so we can do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m41s)
01:36:41

[embedding of it up and then we use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m45s)
01:36:45

[reshape to add a unit access to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m48s)
01:36:48

[front so that it's now the same basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m51s)
01:36:51

[rank right we now have one question of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m55s)
01:36:55

[better to link 20 okay so we have 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h36m59s)
01:36:59

[sentences of the story and one theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m03s)
01:37:03

[okay so what is the memory network or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m08s)
01:37:08

[will specifically the more advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m11s)
01:37:11

[end-to-end memory network and the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m12s)
01:37:12

[is it is this okay as per usual when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m15s)
01:37:15

[get down to it it's less than a page of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m20s)
01:37:20

[code these are these things let's draw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m22s)
01:37:22

[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m26s)
01:37:26

[before we look at the code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m28s)
01:37:28

[okay so we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m34s)
01:37:34

[sentences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m38s)
01:37:38

[Institute's fall sentences for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m41s)
01:37:41

[so each sentence contains a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m45s)
01:37:45

[words and we took each word and returned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m48s)
01:37:48

[them into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m52s)
01:37:52

[and in bedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m54s)
01:37:54

[okay and then we thumbed all of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m57s)
01:37:57

[embeddings up to get an embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h37m59s)
01:37:59

[for that sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m04s)
01:38:04

[but for each sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m06s)
01:38:06

[when embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m10s)
01:38:10

[and they were length 20 foot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m12s)
01:38:12

[um okay and then we took the theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m17s)
01:38:17

[there's none of that here but this is my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m26s)
01:38:26

[story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m30s)
01:38:30

[is my query](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m33s)
01:38:33

[and the idea bunch of words you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m37s)
01:38:37

[embeddings for and we added them up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m40s)
01:38:40

[again inventing for our question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m46s)
01:38:46

[okay so to do a memory Network what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m48s)
01:38:48

[we're going to do is we're going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m53s)
01:38:53

[each of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h38m58s)
01:38:58

[barring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m01s)
01:39:01

[- h1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m04s)
01:39:04

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m06s)
01:39:06

[with the question or query and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m10s)
01:39:10

[just going to take a dot product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m13s)
01:39:13

[and so and draw this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m17s)
01:39:17

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m27s)
01:39:27

[product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m29s)
01:39:29

[but product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m33s)
01:39:33

[okay so we're going to end up with four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m39s)
01:39:39

[products from each sentence of the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m42s)
01:39:42

[science the query alright so like what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m45s)
01:39:45

[are the dot product do it basically says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m48s)
01:39:48

[health similar to things are when one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m50s)
01:39:50

[thing big is the other things big things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m52s)
01:39:52

[small things small things both make the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m54s)
01:39:54

[dot product again okay so these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h39m58s)
01:39:58

[basically are going to be four vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m00s)
01:40:00

[describing out similar each of our four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m02s)
01:40:02

[sentences for the query okay so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m06s)
01:40:06

[check one step two is to stick them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m11s)
01:40:11

[through the softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m15s)
01:40:15

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m23s)
01:40:23

[before come again right so remember dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m26s)
01:40:26

[product is which of the scaler all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m30s)
01:40:30

[so we now have four scales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m32s)
01:40:32

[and they add up to one and they each are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m35s)
01:40:35

[basically related to how similar is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m43s)
01:40:43

[query to each of the four sentences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m45s)
01:40:45

[okay we're now going to create a totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m48s)
01:40:48

[separate embedding our vectors or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m53s)
01:40:53

[sentences that are in our story by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m56s)
01:40:56

[creating a totally separate embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h40m59s)
01:40:59

[for each word so we're basically just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m02s)
01:41:02

[going to create a new random embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m04s)
01:41:04

[matrix for each word to start with some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m07s)
01:41:07

[them all together and that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m11s)
01:41:11

[give us a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m13s)
01:41:13

[betting this one Nicole see I believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m17s)
01:41:17

[and all we're going to do is we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m22s)
01:41:22

[to multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m25s)
01:41:25

[each one of days Pamela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m28s)
01:41:28

[each one of these embeddings we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m36s)
01:41:36

[to multiply by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m38s)
01:41:38

[um equivalent softmax at the wedding and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m40s)
01:41:40

[then just add them all together okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m44s)
01:41:44

[we're just going to have physical s 1 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m47s)
01:41:47

[3 4 going to be C 1 times s 1 plus B 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m52s)
01:41:52

[and s 2 and then divided by you mean yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h41m58s)
01:41:58

[actually don't need to divide by K as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m06s)
01:42:06

[one okay and so that's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m08s)
01:42:08

[our final result which is going to be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m14s)
01:42:14

[blink 20 back so this thing is a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m18s)
01:42:18

[of length 20 and then we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m22s)
01:42:22

[take that letter put put it through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m25s)
01:42:25

[single day slap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m27s)
01:42:27

[get back the anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m31s)
01:42:31

[and that whole thing is the memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m38s)
01:42:38

[it's incredibly simple you know there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m42s)
01:42:42

[no there's nothing deep in terms of deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m46s)
01:42:46

[learning there's almost no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m50s)
01:42:50

[nonlinearities so you know it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m53s)
01:42:53

[seem like it's likely together do very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m58s)
01:42:58

[much but I guess we haven't given it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h42m59s)
01:42:59

[very much to do so let's take a look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m01s)
01:43:01

[the the code version yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m04s)
01:43:04

[so Joan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m08s)
01:43:08

[so in the last step you said the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m12s)
01:43:12

[was that really like the embedding of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m13s)
01:43:13

[the answer and then it has to get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m15s)
01:43:15

[reverse lookup it's yeah it's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m17s)
01:43:17

[softmax at the end stuff and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m19s)
01:43:19

[have to an automatic okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m21s)
01:43:21

[um so here it is right we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m26s)
01:43:26

[we've got the story times the theory of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m30s)
01:43:30

[the embedding of the story times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m35s)
01:43:35

[embedding the query the dot product we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m36s)
01:43:36

[do a softmax softmax works from the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m41s)
01:43:41

[dimension so I just have to reshape to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m44s)
01:43:44

[get rid of the unit axis and then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m46s)
01:43:46

[reach it again weather unit access back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m47s)
01:43:47

[on again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m49s)
01:43:49

[but you know the reshapes aren't doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m50s)
01:43:50

[anything interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m52s)
01:43:52

[let's just stop product followed by soft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m53s)
01:43:53

[necks okay and that gives us the weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h43m55s)
01:43:55

[each weight and multiply it by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m02s)
01:44:02

[second set of embeddings is our second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m06s)
01:44:06

[setting the villain can get antsy and or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m09s)
01:44:09

[do this I just use the dot product again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m12s)
01:44:12

[but because of the fact that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m16s)
01:44:16

[forgiving access there this is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m19s)
01:44:19

[just doing a very simple web damage and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m21s)
01:44:21

[again reshape together to the unit axis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m26s)
01:44:26

[so that we can stick it through a dense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m29s)
01:44:29

[layer with a soft mass and that gives us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m31s)
01:44:31

[our final result so what this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m34s)
01:44:34

[effectively doing is it's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m38s)
01:44:38

[saying okay how similar is the query](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m40s)
01:44:40

[through each one of the sentences in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m44s)
01:44:44

[story use that to create a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m46s)
01:44:46

[weights and then these things here are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m49s)
01:44:49

[basically the answers right it's like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m51s)
01:44:51

[story number 1 was where the answer was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m54s)
01:44:54

[then we're going to use this one story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m57s)
01:44:57

[for two three and four right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h44m59s)
01:44:59

[there's a single you know single linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m01s)
01:45:01

[layer at the very end so it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m04s)
01:45:04

[really gets too much computation so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m06s)
01:45:06

[these it versa care to learn what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m08s)
01:45:08

[answers represent like each story is and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m11s)
01:45:11

[again this is lucky because the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m13s)
01:45:13

[original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m20s)
01:45:20

[from the original data set the answer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m26s)
01:45:26

[every question is the last word of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m30s)
01:45:30

[sentence I where is Frodo's ring order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m35s)
01:45:35

[right so that's why we just can't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m39s)
01:45:39

[this incredibly simple file piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m42s)
01:45:42

[so we you know this is an interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m46s)
01:45:46

[use of cars right with we've created a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m49s)
01:45:49

[model which is in no possible way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m52s)
01:45:52

[declining right but it's you know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m56s)
01:45:56

[bunch of tensors and layers that have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h45m59s)
01:45:59

[stuck together and so it has some inputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m01s)
01:46:01

[it has an output so we can call it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m04s)
01:46:04

[model we can compile it with an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m06s)
01:46:06

[optimizer and the life okay and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m08s)
01:46:08

[can fit it so it's kind of interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m12s)
01:46:12

[how you can use character things which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m14s)
01:46:14

[you know don't really use any other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m17s)
01:46:17

[normal players and in a normal way and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m19s)
01:46:19

[as you can see it works and for what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m22s)
01:46:22

[it's worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m25s)
01:46:25

[okay we've solved this problem and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m25s)
01:46:25

[particular problem we've solved here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m27s)
01:46:27

[the one supporting that problem and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m29s)
01:46:29

[fact it works in less than one o'clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m33s)
01:46:33

[more interesting is to supporting that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m38s)
01:46:38

[actually before I do that I was point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m41s)
01:46:41

[out something interesting which is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m42s)
01:46:42

[could create another model now this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m45s)
01:46:45

[already trained which is to return not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m47s)
01:46:47

[the final answer but the value of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m49s)
01:46:49

[the weight okay and so we can now go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m52s)
01:46:52

[back and say okay for a particular story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m55s)
01:46:55

[what are the weights so let's do s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h46m59s)
01:46:59

[so for this story where is Sandra Daniel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m06s)
01:47:06

[Mary Sandra Sandra went to the bathroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m10s)
01:47:10

[whereas Sandra bathroom right so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m13s)
01:47:13

[this particular story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m16s)
01:47:16

[the waves are here right and you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m18s)
01:47:18

[the wait for Simpsons number two is 0.98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m22s)
01:47:22

[so we can actually look inside the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m27s)
01:47:27

[femoral and find out you know what what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m30s)
01:47:30

[sentence isn't using to enter this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m34s)
01:47:34

[question we have a question would it not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m35s)
01:47:35

[make more sense to contact the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m40s)
01:47:40

[embeddings rather than some of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m41s)
01:47:41

[um not the best particular problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m45s)
01:47:45

[because because of the way the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m47s)
01:47:47

[vocabulary is structured on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m49s)
01:47:49

[sentences and strategies you would also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m51s)
01:47:51

[have to deal with the variable length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m54s)
01:47:54

[yeah well as the briefly he's patting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h47m56s)
01:47:56

[tomato in the same way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m00s)
01:48:00

[yeah but if you wanted to use this in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m04s)
01:48:04

[real life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m06s)
01:48:06

[you would need to come up with a better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m07s)
01:48:07

[sentence abating it's presumably might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m09s)
01:48:09

[be an RN or something like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m12s)
01:48:12

[as you need to deal with things learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m16s)
01:48:16

[not and the location of subject object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m18s)
01:48:18

[and so forth one thing to point out is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m22s)
01:48:22

[that the order of the sentences matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m24s)
01:48:24

[and so what I actually did was when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m27s)
01:48:27

[pre-processed took what they added a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m29s)
01:48:29

[zero call in one call and whatever to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m31s)
01:48:31

[start of each sentence right so that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m34s)
01:48:34

[would actually be able to learn the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m37s)
01:48:37

[order of sentences so this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m39s)
01:48:39

[another token that I add because you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m41s)
01:48:41

[wondering what that was so something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m45s)
01:48:45

[that I had in the pre presidency okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m46s)
01:48:46

[one nice thing is every networks we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m49s)
01:48:49

[kind of look and see if they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m51s)
01:48:51

[working in six or why they don't work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m53s)
01:48:53

[okay so multi hot so let's now look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h48m57s)
01:48:57

[an example of a to support fast story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m01s)
01:49:01

[it's mildly more interesting we still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m05s)
01:49:05

[only have one type of verb with very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m08s)
01:49:08

[synonyms and a small number of subjects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m10s)
01:49:10

[and smaller objects but basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m12s)
01:49:12

[same but now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m15s)
01:49:15

[to answer your question we have to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m19s)
01:49:19

[down through hops so where is the milk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m21s)
01:49:21

[okay let's fly in the milk then you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m23s)
01:49:23

[lift the milk there okay where is Daniel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m27s)
01:49:27

[then you'll travel to the whole way okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m30s)
01:49:30

[where is the milk all where all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m32s)
01:49:32

[that's what we have to going to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m35s)
01:49:35

[time and so what kind of two is exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m37s)
01:49:37

[the same thing as we did before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m41s)
01:49:41

[but we're going to take it our home at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m46s)
01:49:46

[all a whole little model alright so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m48s)
01:49:48

[you're the embedding reshape dot reshape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m52s)
01:49:52

[softmax reshape dot reshape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h49m55s)
01:49:55

[but it's a dense layer thumb and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m01s)
01:50:01

[going to call this one hot so this whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m10s)
01:50:10

[picture is going to become one hot and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m12s)
01:50:12

[what we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m17s)
01:50:17

[is we're going to take this and go back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m21s)
01:50:21

[and replace the query](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m25s)
01:50:25

[with our new output that's what it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m30s)
01:50:30

[step h-hot we're going to replace the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m33s)
01:50:33

[query without with the result of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m36s)
01:50:36

[memory Network and so that way the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m39s)
01:50:39

[memory Network and learn to recognize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m42s)
01:50:42

[that okay the first thing I need is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m47s)
01:50:47

[milk search back find milk okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m50s)
01:50:50

[I now have the milk now you need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m54s)
01:50:54

[update the query to where is Daniel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h50m57s)
01:50:57

[okay now go back I'm Daniel right so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m00s)
01:51:00

[memory networks in multi hot mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m04s)
01:51:04

[basically does his whole thing again and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m07s)
01:51:07

[again and again replacing the query H](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m11s)
01:51:11

[son right so that's why this took the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m13s)
01:51:13

[whole set of steps and checked it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m19s)
01:51:19

[single function and so then I just go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m20s)
01:51:20

[okay response comma story is one hop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m23s)
01:51:23

[response summer story is one hop on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m27s)
01:51:27

[and you can keep repeating that again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m30s)
01:51:30

[and again and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m31s)
01:51:31

[and then at the end get an output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m34s)
01:51:34

[but the model pyro it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m39s)
01:51:39

[I had real trouble getting this to pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m44s)
01:51:44

[nicely I had to play around a lot with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m48s)
01:51:48

[learning rates and batch sizes and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m52s)
01:51:52

[whatever else that I did eventually get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m54s)
01:51:54

[a two point nine nine nine equity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h51m56s)
01:51:56

[ah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m02s)
01:52:02

[so this is kind of an unusual part for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m04s)
01:52:04

[me to be teaching because I particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m09s)
01:52:09

[compared to part one whereas like best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m11s)
01:52:11

[practices know clearly this is anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m13s)
01:52:13

[but I'm kind of showing you something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m15s)
01:52:15

[which was like maybe the most popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m18s)
01:52:18

[request with like teachers about chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m22s)
01:52:22

[box and they let's be honest to who has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m23s)
01:52:23

[ever used a chat pod that's not terrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m27s)
01:52:27

[and the reason that ones do this Chapel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m29s)
01:52:29

[is not terrible is that the current](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m31s)
01:52:31

[state of the art is terrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m32s)
01:52:32

[so chat pods have their place and indeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m35s)
01:52:35

[from one of the students class has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m41s)
01:52:41

[written really interesting kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m42s)
01:52:42

[analysis of this particularly she'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m44s)
01:52:44

[share on the forum but that place is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m47s)
01:52:47

[really kind of lots of sure is big and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m50s)
01:52:50

[you know carefully set up vocabularies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m55s)
01:52:55

[and selecting from small sets of answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h52m57s)
01:52:57

[and so forth it's not kind of general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m01s)
01:53:01

[purpose here's a story ask anything you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m04s)
01:53:04

[like about it here are some answers it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m08s)
01:53:08

[not to say we won't get there I sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m12s)
01:53:12

[hope we will but they're kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m14s)
01:53:14

[incredible hike we had around your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m18s)
01:53:18

[curing machines and memory network and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m20s)
01:53:20

[into it and we network is clinic as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m22s)
01:53:22

[can see when you actually even we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m25s)
01:53:25

[look at the data set what their work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m27s)
01:53:27

[plan is kind of crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m28s)
01:53:28

[so that is not quite the final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m31s)
01:53:31

[conclusion of this though because um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m37s)
01:53:37

[yesterday a paper came out which showed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m39s)
01:53:39

[how to identify buffer overruns in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m45s)
01:53:45

[computer source code using memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m49s)
01:53:49

[networks and so it kind of brought my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m53s)
01:53:53

[whole narrative that somebody seems to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h53m57s)
01:53:57

[have actually used this technology for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m00s)
01:54:00

[something effectively and I guess when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m03s)
01:54:03

[you think about it it makes some sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m06s)
01:54:06

[right so because you don't know what a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m08s)
01:54:08

[buffer overrun is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m09s)
01:54:09

[like if you're writing in an unsafe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m10s)
01:54:10

[language properly see you allocate some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m13s)
01:54:13

[memory is going to store some results or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m16s)
01:54:16

[some input and you try to put into that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m19s)
01:54:19

[memory something bigger than the analogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m21s)
01:54:21

[allocated to basically build Elliott and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m24s)
01:54:24

[in the best case it crashes in the worst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m27s)
01:54:27

[case somebody figured out how to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m32s)
01:54:32

[exactly the right closest sellout and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m34s)
01:54:34

[protected right place and then by taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m36s)
01:54:36

[over your own machine the buffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m38s)

[idea of being able to find them if I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m45s)
01:54:45

[actually see it does look like a memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m47s)

[Network you kind of have to see like oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m49s)
01:54:49

[where was that variable kind of set and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m51s)
01:54:51

[then whether things are set from search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m54s)
01:54:54

[and those original being allocated it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m56s)
01:54:56

[kind of like just going back through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h54m59s)
01:54:59

[source code and the vocabulary is pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m01s)
01:55:01

[straightforward you notice the variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m04s)
01:55:04

[to be defined so you know that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m06s)
01:55:06

[interesting I haven't had a chance to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m10s)

[really study the paper yet but yeah it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m12s)
01:55:12

[no chatbot but maybe there is a room for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m16s)
01:55:16

[memory networks already after all if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m19s)
01:55:19

[they're way to visualize what the neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m22s)

[is no dural Network okay if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m27s)
01:55:27

[mainly embedding I mean yeah I mean you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m30s)
01:55:30

[can look at the embeddings easily enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m34s)
01:55:34

[I mean the whole thing is so simple very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m35s)
01:55:35

[easy to look at every embedding and as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m37s)

[mentioned we looked at visualizing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m40s)

[weights that will care how the softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m42s)
01:55:42

[but I mean we don't even need to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m46s)
01:55:46

[it in order to figure out what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m49s)
01:55:49

[learned right like based on the fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m51s)
01:55:51

[that this is just another small number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m52s)
01:55:52

[of simple linear steps we know that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m54s)
01:55:54

[basically has to learn what the what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h55m58s)
01:55:58

[conveyance of the weights are going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h56m22s)
01:56:22

[have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h56m24s)
01:56:24

[basically learned how to come up with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h56m24s)
01:56:24

[that's going to be probably a similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h56m26s)
01:56:26

01:56:33

[that gives you similarity scores so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h56m35s)
01:56:35

[is really a very simple largely linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h56m38s)

[to say that memory networks are useless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h56m51s)

[think we can play the press I think we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h57m11s)

[have the brain Facebook for creating a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h57m12s)

[idea which I find very surprising from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h57m19s)

[somebody I liked who I asked him what he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h57m52s)
01:57:52

[thought was kind of the most exciting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h57m55s)
01:57:55

[research in this direction at the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h57m57s)

[and he mentioned something that I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h57m59s)

[is the first to solve all of the all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m10s)

[the body parts with a hundred percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m15s)

[accuracy now you know take it out what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m17s)
01:58:17

[you will I don't know how much that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m21s)
01:58:21

[means it synthetic tasks one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m24s)
01:58:24

[things that they merrily actually point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m27s)
01:58:27

[out in a blog post is that they are you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m29s)
01:58:29

[know even the basic kind of coding of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m32s)
01:58:32

[how their friend is pretty bad they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m33s)
01:58:33

[lots of replicas and just like the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m35s)
01:58:35

[thing's going to mess but anyway um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m37s)
01:58:37

[nonetheless this is a interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m40s)
01:58:40

[approach so if you're interested in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m43s)
01:58:43

[memory networks there is certainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m45s)
01:58:45

[something you can look at and I do think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m47s)
01:58:47

[this is yeah you know it's likely been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m49s)
01:58:49

[important direction having said all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m52s)
01:58:52

[one of the key reasons I wanted to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m54s)
01:58:54

[at these memory networks is not only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m56s)
01:58:56

[because it was the largest request I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h58m59s)
01:58:59

[think from the forums that is part of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m01s)
01:59:01

[the course but also because it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m02s)
01:59:02

[introduces something can be critical the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m04s)
01:59:04

[next couple of lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m09s)
01:59:09

[which is the concept of attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m12s)
01:59:12

[attention or attentional models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m17s)
01:59:17

[models where we have to do exactly what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m25s)
01:59:25

[we just looked at which is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m30s)
01:59:30

[find out at each time you know which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m31s)
01:59:31

[part you know of a story to look at in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m37s)
01:59:37

[or which part of an image from a better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m40s)
01:59:40

[part of the sentence volcanoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m44s)
01:59:44

[and so the task that we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m47s)
01:59:47

[trying to get get out over the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m49s)
01:59:49

[lesson or two is going to be to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m52s)
01:59:52

[translate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m54s)
01:59:54

[French into English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=01h59m56s)
01:59:56

[okay so this is clearly not a toy task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m01s)
02:00:01

[right this is a very challenging task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m03s)
02:00:03

[and one of the challenges is that in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m06s)
02:00:06

[particular French tension sentence which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m09s)
02:00:09

[is got some bunch of words it's likely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m11s)
02:00:11

[to turn into an English sentence with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m14s)
02:00:14

[some different bunch of words and maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m16s)
02:00:16

[these particular words here might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m18s)
02:00:18

[this translation here and this one might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m20s)
02:00:20

[be this one and this one might be this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m23s)
02:00:23

[one and so as you go through you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m24s)
02:00:24

[some way of saying like Oh which words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m27s)
02:00:27

[weather pattern next all right so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m29s)
02:00:29

[going to be the attentional model and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m32s)
02:00:32

[what we're going to do is we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m36s)
02:00:36

[be trying to come up with a proper irony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m39s)
02:00:39

[in on proper irony like an LS TM or a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m43s)
02:00:43

[guru or whatever where we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m46s)
02:00:46

[change it so that inside the RNN it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m48s)
02:00:48

[going to actually have some way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m54s)
02:00:54

[figuring out which part of the input to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h00m56s)
02:00:56

[look at next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m00s)
02:01:00

[so that's the basic idea of attentional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m02s)
02:01:02

[model and so interestingly during this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m05s)
02:01:05

[time that memory networks and your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m09s)
02:01:09

[recurring machines and stuff we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m12s)
02:01:12

[getting all this huge amount of press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m14s)
02:01:14

[attention very quietly in the background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m17s)
02:01:17

[of exactly the same same attentional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m20s)
02:01:20

[models were appearing as well and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m23s)
02:01:23

[the attentional model for language that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m27s)
02:01:27

[have really turned out to be critical so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m31s)
02:01:31

[you're probably seeing all of the press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m34s)

[about Google's new your translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m39s)

[system and that really is everything but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m42s)
02:01:42

[it's planned to be like it really is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m43s)
02:01:43

[basically one giant neural network that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m47s)
02:01:47

[can translate any pair of languages the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m51s)
02:01:51

[accuracy of those translations is far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m54s)
02:01:54

[beyond anything that's happened before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m57s)
02:01:57

[and the basic structure of that neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h01m58s)
02:01:58

[net is as we going to learn is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m04s)
02:02:04

[you know not that different what we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m07s)
02:02:07

[already learned I'm just going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m10s)
02:02:10

[this one extra step which is some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m12s)
02:02:12

[attention and kind of depending on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m14s)
02:02:14

[you know how interested you guys are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m18s)
02:02:18

[details of this New York translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m20s)
02:02:20

[system that turned out that they're also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m22s)
02:02:22

[lot such a tall bricks you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m23s)
02:02:23

[tweets are kind of around like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m26s)
02:02:26

[you've got a really big vocabulary some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m30s)
02:02:30

[of the words appear very rarely you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m33s)
02:02:33

[how do you build a system that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m36s)
02:02:36

[understand how to translate those really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m38s)
02:02:38

[rare words for example and also just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m40s)
02:02:40

[kind of things like how do you deal with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m44s)
02:02:44

[the memory issues around having huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m46s)
02:02:46

[embedding their sensors 102 the atom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m49s)
02:02:49

[words and stuff like that so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m51s)
02:02:51

[like lots of details and the nice thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m55s)
02:02:55

[is that because again actually because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h02m57s)
02:02:57

[Google would ended up putting this be in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m00s)
02:03:00

[production all of these little details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m02s)
02:03:02

[kind of advances now and those answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m05s)
02:03:05

[are already interesting there aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m08s)
02:03:08

[really on the whole great examples of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m11s)
02:03:11

[kind of all of those things put together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m15s)
02:03:15

[so you know what I think interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m18s)
02:03:18

[here will be that you'll have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m21s)
02:03:21

[opportunities to kind of do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m21s)
02:03:21

[generally speaking the blog posts about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m24s)
02:03:24

[the kind of New York translation systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m27s)
02:03:27

[tend to be kind of at a pretty high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m29s)
02:03:29

[level it has spread like roughly how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m30s)
02:03:30

[these kind of approaches work that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m33s)
02:03:33

[Google's complete neuro translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m35s)
02:03:35

[system is not out there you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m38s)
02:03:38

[download version see the code so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m40s)
02:03:40

[know we'll see how we go but we're kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m44s)
02:03:44

[of doers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m47s)
02:03:47

[if buddies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m49s)
02:03:49

[here so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h03m54s)
02:03:54

[yeah I guess one other thing to mention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m00s)
02:04:00

[about the memory network is the carrot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m02s)
02:04:02

[actually comes with a end to end memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m07s)
02:04:07

[Network example in the in the Clarisse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m11s)
02:04:11

[github which weirdly enough when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m14s)
02:04:14

[actually doctored it it turns out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m18s)
02:04:18

[doesn't implement this at all and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m21s)
02:04:21

[even on the single putting that thing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m25s)
02:04:25

[takes many many generations and doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m27s)
02:04:27

[get to understand accuracy and I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m30s)
02:04:30

[this quite surprising to discover this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m34s)
02:04:34

[you know once you start getting to some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m36s)
02:04:36

[of these more recent advances or kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m38s)
02:04:38

[non you know not not just a standard CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m42s)
02:04:42

[whatever it's just less and less common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m46s)
02:04:46

[that you actually find code that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m49s)
02:04:49

[correct in the works and so this memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m51s)
02:04:51

[network example was one of them so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m54s)
02:04:54

[you actually go into the chaos that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m56s)
02:04:56

[could happen with an examples and go and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h04m58s)
02:04:58

[have a look and download the memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m01s)
02:05:01

[Network you'll find that you don't get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m02s)
02:05:02

[resolved anything like this if you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m04s)
02:05:04

[at the code you'll see that it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m06s)
02:05:06

[it really doesn't do this at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m09s)
02:05:09

[so I just kind of wanted to mention that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m13s)
02:05:13

[as a bit of a warning that you're kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m14s)
02:05:14

[of at the point now where I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m18s)
02:05:18

[take with a grain of salt but posts you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m20s)
02:05:20

[reads like or even some places if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m22s)
02:05:22

[read well worth experimenting with them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m24s)
02:05:24

[and assuming you know we should start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m28s)
02:05:28

[the assumption that you can do it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m30s)
02:05:30

[and maybe even start the assumption that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m31s)
02:05:31

[you can't necessarily trust all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m35s)
02:05:35

[conclusions that you've read because the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m39s)
02:05:39

[vast majority to client in my experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m43s)
02:05:43

[between together this part of the course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m45s)
02:05:45

[the bartender at a time the stuff out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m47s)
02:05:47

[there is wrong even in fact it's late in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m49s)

[material sauce covert even napkins this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m57s)
02:05:57

[is just wrong so I think that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h05m59s)
02:05:59

[important important point to be aware of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h06m02s)
02:06:02

[okay I think we're done so I think we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I#t=02h06m07s)
