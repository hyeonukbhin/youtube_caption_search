[updated information about like what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h00m49s)
00:00:49

[environments to use how the technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h00m52s)
00:00:52

[changes and so you need to go here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h00m54s)

[right so that's tip number one for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m04s)
00:01:04

[video tip number two for the video is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m07s)
00:01:07

[because I can't edit them all I can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m10s)
00:01:10

[is add these things called cards and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m12s)
00:01:12

[cards or little things that appear in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m14s)
00:01:14

[the top corner of the top right hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m16s)
00:01:16

[corner of the screen so by the time this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m18s)
00:01:18

[video comes out I'm going to put a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m20s)
00:01:20

[little card there right now for you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m21s)
00:01:21

[click on and try that out unfortunately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m23s)
00:01:23

[they're not easy to notice so keep an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m26s)
00:01:26

[eye out for that because that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m28s)
00:01:28

[be important updates to the video all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m29s)
00:01:29

[right so welcome we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m33s)
00:01:33

[learning about machine learning today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m35s)
00:01:35

[then so after everybody in the class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m39s)
00:01:39

[here you all have Amazon Web Services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m41s)
00:01:41

[setup so you might want to go ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m44s)
00:01:44

[launch your AWS instance now or go ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[and create one short Jupiter notebook on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m51s)
00:01:51

[your own computer if you don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m53s)
00:01:53

[Jupiter notebook setup then what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h01m57s)
00:01:57

[recommend is you go to cresol calm wws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m01s)
00:02:01

[or calm sign in there sign up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m04s)
00:02:04

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m08s)
00:02:08

[and you can then turn off enable GPU and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m09s)
00:02:09

[click start Jupiter and you'll have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m14s)
00:02:14

[Jupiter notebook instantly that costs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m15s)
00:02:15

[you some money it's three cents an hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m18s)
00:02:18

[okay so if you don't mind spending three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m20s)
00:02:20

[cents an hour to learn machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m23s)
00:02:23

[here's a good way so I'm going to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m24s)
00:02:24

[ahead and say start Jupiter and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m26s)
00:02:26

[whatever technique you use there you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m29s)
00:02:29

[one of the things that you'll find on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m32s)
00:02:32

[the website is links to lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m34s)
00:02:34

[information about the costs and benefits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m37s)
00:02:37

[and approaches to setting up lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m39s)
00:02:39

[different environments for Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m41s)
00:02:41

[notebook both the deep learning and for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m43s)
00:02:43

[regular machine learning so check them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[out because there's lots of options so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m48s)
00:02:48

[if I then go open a Jupiter and Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[in a new tab Here I am in Kressel or on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h02m55s)
00:02:55

[AWS or your own computer we use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m01s)
00:03:01

[Anaconda Python distribution for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m05s)
00:03:05

[basically everything you can install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m07s)
00:03:07

[that yourself and again there's lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m09s)
00:03:09

[information on the website about how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m12s)
00:03:12

[set that up we're also assuming that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m13s)
00:03:13

[either you're using Kressel or there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[something else which I really like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m21s)
00:03:21

[called paper space comm which is another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m23s)
00:03:23

[place you can fire up if you put a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[notebook pretty much instantly both of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m27s)
00:03:27

[these have already have all of the fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m30s)
00:03:30

[AI stuff pre-installed for you so as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m34s)
00:03:34

[soon as you open up cresol or paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m36s)
00:03:36

[space assuming you chose the paper space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m38s)
00:03:38

[fast AI template you'll see that there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m40s)
00:03:40

[a fast AI folder okay if you are using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m43s)
00:03:43

[your own computer or AWS you'll need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[go to our github repo fast AI fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m50s)
00:03:50

[and clone it okay and then you'll need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m54s)
00:03:54

[to do a condor and update to install the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h03m58s)
00:03:58

[libraries and again that's all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m01s)
00:04:01

[information we put on the website and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m03s)
00:04:03

[we've got some previous workshop videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m05s)
00:04:05

[to help you through all of those deaths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m07s)
00:04:07

[so for this class I'm assuming that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m08s)
00:04:08

[have a Jupiter notebook running okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m12s)
00:04:12

[so here we are in the in the Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m17s)
00:04:17

[notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m20s)
00:04:20

[and if I click on fast AI that's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m21s)
00:04:21

[you get if you get clone or if you're in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m25s)
00:04:25

[Chris all you can see our repo here all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[of our lessons are inside the courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m32s)
00:04:32

[folder and the machine learning part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m36s)
00:04:36

[is in the ml one folder if you're ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m40s)
00:04:40

[looking at my screen and wondering where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m45s)
00:04:45

[are you look up here and you'll see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m47s)
00:04:47

[tells you the path fast AI forces ml 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m51s)
00:04:51

[and today we're going to be looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m55s)
00:04:55

[less than one random forests so here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h04m58s)
00:04:58

[lesson 1 RF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m01s)
00:05:01

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m06s)
00:05:06

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m10s)
00:05:10

[so there's a couple of different ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m15s)
00:05:15

[you can do this both here in person or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m17s)
00:05:17

[on the video you can either attempt to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m20s)
00:05:20

[follow along as you watch or you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m23s)
00:05:23

[just watch and then follow along later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m26s)
00:05:26

[with the video it's up to you I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m28s)
00:05:28

[maybe have a loose recommendation to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m33s)
00:05:33

[to watch now and follow along with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m37s)
00:05:37

[video later just because it's quite hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m41s)
00:05:41

[to motor tasks and if you're working on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m45s)
00:05:45

[something you might miss a key piece of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m47s)
00:05:47

[information which you're welcome to ask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m49s)
00:05:49

[about okay but if you follow along with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m52s)
00:05:52

[the video afterwards then you can pause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[stop experiment and so forth but anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h05m57s)
00:05:57

[you can choose either way I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m01s)
00:06:01

[go of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m04s)
00:06:04

[Topol header view toggle tool bar and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m05s)
00:06:05

[then full screen it so to get a bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m08s)
00:06:08

[space so the basic approach we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m12s)
00:06:12

[to be teaching here taking here is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m19s)
00:06:19

[get straight into code start building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m21s)
00:06:21

[models not to look at theory we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m24s)
00:06:24

[to get to other theory okay but at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m29s)
00:06:29

[point where you deeply understand what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m32s)
00:06:32

[it's for and at the point that you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m33s)
00:06:33

[able to be an effective practitioner so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m35s)
00:06:35

[my hope is that you're going to spend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m39s)
00:06:39

[your time focusing on experimenting so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m41s)
00:06:41

[if you take these notebooks and try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m44s)
00:06:44

[different variations of what I show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m46s)
00:06:46

[try it with your own data sets the more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m48s)
00:06:48

[coding you can do the better the more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m51s)
00:06:51

[you'll learn ok don't in you know my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m54s)
00:06:54

[suggestion or at least and all of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m57s)
00:06:57

[students have told me the ones who have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h06m58s)

[gone away and spent time studying books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m00s)
00:07:00

[of theory rather than coding found that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m03s)
00:07:03

[they learnt less machine learning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m06s)
00:07:06

[that they often tell me they wish that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m08s)
00:07:08

[one more time coding the stuff that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m09s)
00:07:09

[we're showing in this course a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m15s)
00:07:15

[it's never been shown before this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m16s)
00:07:16

[a summary of other people's research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m18s)
00:07:18

[this is more a summary of 25 years of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m21s)
00:07:21

[work that I've been doing in machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m24s)
00:07:24

[learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m25s)
00:07:25

[so a lot of this is going to be shown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m26s)
00:07:26

[for the first time and so that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m28s)
00:07:28

[cool because if you want to write a blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m30s)
00:07:30

[post about something that you learn here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m32s)
00:07:32

[you might be building something but a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m33s)
00:07:33

[lot of people find super useful all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m36s)
00:07:36

[right so there's a great opportunity to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m37s)
00:07:37

[practice your technical writing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m40s)
00:07:40

[here's some examples of good technical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m42s)
00:07:42

[writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m43s)
00:07:43

[okay page by showing people stuff which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m43s)
00:07:43

[you've it's not like hey I just learnt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m46s)
00:07:46

[this thing I bet you all know it often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m48s)
00:07:48

[it'll be I just want this thing and I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[going to tell you about it and other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m52s)
00:07:52

[people haven't seen it in fact this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m53s)
00:07:53

[the first course ever that's been built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m56s)
00:07:56

[on top of the first AI library so even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[just stuff in the library is going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m01s)
00:08:01

[new to like everybody okay so when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m03s)
00:08:03

[use a droopin a notebook or anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[else in python we have to import the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m09s)
00:08:09

[libraries that we're going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[something that's quite convenient as if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m15s)
00:08:15

[you use these to auto reload commands at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m17s)
00:08:17

[the top of your notebook you can go in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[and edit the source code of the modules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m22s)
00:08:22

[and your notebook will automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m25s)
00:08:25

[update with those new modules you won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[have to like restart anything so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[super handy then to show your plots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m31s)
00:08:31

[inside the notebook you're wanting that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m34s)
00:08:34

[plot in line so these three lines appear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m36s)
00:08:36

[at the top of all of my notebooks you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m38s)
00:08:38

[notice when I import the libraries that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m44s)
00:08:44

[for anybody here who is a experienced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m46s)
00:08:46

[Python programmer I am doing something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m48s)
00:08:48

[that would be widely considered very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m51s)
00:08:51

[inappropriate I'm importing star okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m53s)
00:08:53

[generally speaking in software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m56s)
00:08:56

[engineering we're taught to like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m57s)
00:08:57

[specifically figure out what we need and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h08m59s)
00:08:59

[import those things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m01s)
00:09:01

[the more experienced you are as Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m05s)
00:09:05

[programmer the more extremely offensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m07s)
00:09:07

[practices you're going to see me use for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m09s)
00:09:09

[example I don't follow what's called pap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[8 which is the normal style method style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m13s)
00:09:13

[of code used in Python so I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m16s)
00:09:16

[mention a couple of things first is go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m19s)
00:09:19

[along with it for a while don't judge me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m23s)
00:09:23

[just yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m24s)
00:09:24

[right there's reasons that I do these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m25s)
00:09:25

[things and if it really bothers you then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[feel free to to change it right but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m29s)
00:09:29

[basic idea is data science is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m31s)
00:09:31

[software engineering right there's a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m35s)
00:09:35

[of overlap you know we're using the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[languages and in the end these things or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m38s)
00:09:38

[may become software engineering projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m41s)
00:09:41

[but what we're doing right now is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[prototyping models and prototyping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m47s)
00:09:47

[models has a very different set of best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[practices that are taught basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[nowhere right they're not really even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m54s)
00:09:54

[really written down but the key is to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m56s)
00:09:56

[able to do things very interactively and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h09m59s)
00:09:59

[very iteratively right so for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m01s)
00:10:01

[from library import star means you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m04s)
00:10:04

[have to figure out ahead of time what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m07s)
00:10:07

[you're going to need from that library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m09s)
00:10:09

[it's it's all there okay also because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m11s)
00:10:11

[we're in this wonderful interactive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m14s)
00:10:14

[Jupiter environment it lets us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m16s)
00:10:16

[understand what's in the libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m20s)
00:10:20

[really well so for example later on I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m22s)
00:10:22

[using a function called display right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m27s)
00:10:27

[an obvious question is like well what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m30s)
00:10:30

[display so you can just type the name of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m32s)
00:10:32

[a function and press shift enter member](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m35s)
00:10:35

[shift enter is is to run a cell and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m38s)
00:10:38

[will tell you where it's from right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m41s)
00:10:41

[anytime you see a function you are not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m43s)
00:10:43

[familiar with you can find out where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m45s)
00:10:45

[it's wrong and then if you want to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m47s)
00:10:47

[out what it does put a question mark at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[the start okay and here you have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m53s)
00:10:53

[documentation and then particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h10m59s)
00:10:59

[helpful for the faster I library so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m02s)
00:11:02

[faster I library I try to make as many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m04s)
00:11:04

[functions as possible be like no more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m06s)
00:11:06

[than about five lines of code it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m09s)
00:11:09

[going to be really easy to read right if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m11s)
00:11:11

[you put a second question mark at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m14s)
00:11:14

[star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m15s)
00:11:15

[it shows you the source code of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m17s)
00:11:17

[function right so all the documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m21s)
00:11:21

[plus the source code so you can see like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m26s)
00:11:26

[nothing has to be mysterious and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m28s)
00:11:28

[going to be using the other library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m31s)
00:11:31

[we'll use a lot is scikit-learn which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[kind of implements a lot of machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m35s)
00:11:35

[learning stuff in Python the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m37s)
00:11:37

[scikit-learn source code is often pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m40s)
00:11:40

[readable and so very often if I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m43s)
00:11:43

[really understand something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m45s)
00:11:45

[I'll just go question mark question mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m46s)
00:11:46

[and the name of the scikit-learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m48s)
00:11:48

[function I'm typing and I'll just go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m50s)
00:11:50

[ahead and read the source code as I say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m51s)
00:11:51

[the first day I library in particular is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m55s)
00:11:55

[designed to have source code that's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h11m57s)
00:11:57

[easy to read and we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m00s)
00:12:00

[reading it a lot okay all right so today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m01s)
00:12:01

[we're going to be working on a cattle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m07s)
00:12:07

[competition called Blue Book for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m09s)
00:12:09

[bulldozers so the first thing we need is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m10s)
00:12:10

[to get that data so if you go Cargill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m14s)
00:12:14

[bulldozers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m17s)
00:12:17

[then you can find it so cackle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m21s)
00:12:21

[competitions allow you to download a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m26s)
00:12:26

[real-world data set that's somebody a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m29s)

[real problem that somebody's trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m31s)
00:12:31

[solve and solve it according to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m33s)

[specification that that actual person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m35s)
00:12:35

[with that actual problem decided would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m38s)
00:12:38

[be actually helpful to them right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m39s)
00:12:39

[these are pretty authentic experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m42s)
00:12:42

[for applied machine learning now of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m45s)
00:12:45

[course you're missing all the bit that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m48s)
00:12:48

[went before which was why did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m50s)

[bulldozers was important where did they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m56s)
00:12:56

[get the data from how did they clean the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h12m59s)
00:12:59

[data and so forth okay and that's all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m01s)
00:13:01

[important stuff as well but the focus of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m03s)
00:13:03

[this course is really on what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m06s)
00:13:06

[next which is like how do you actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m08s)
00:13:08

[build the model one of the great things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m10s)
00:13:10

[about you working on Cargill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m13s)
00:13:13

[competitions whether they be running now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m14s)
00:13:14

[or whether they be old ones is that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m16s)
00:13:16

[can submit yours to the leaderboard even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m18s)
00:13:18

[old closed competitions you can submit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[to the leaderboard and find out how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m23s)
00:13:23

[would you have gone right and there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m24s)
00:13:24

[really no other way in the world of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[knowing whether you're competent at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m27s)
00:13:27

[kind of data in this kind of model than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m32s)
00:13:32

[doing that right because otherwise if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m34s)
00:13:34

[your accuracy is really bad is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m36s)
00:13:36

[because this is just very hard like it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m39s)
00:13:39

[just not possible then the data is so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m41s)
00:13:41

[noisy you can't do better or is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m44s)
00:13:44

[actually that it's an easy data set and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m46s)
00:13:46

[you've made a mistake and like when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m49s)
00:13:49

[finish this course and apply this to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m54s)
00:13:54

[your own projects this is going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m56s)
00:13:56

[something you're going to find very hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m58s)
00:13:58

[and there isn't a simple solution to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h13m59s)
00:13:59

[which is you're now using something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m02s)
00:14:02

[hasn't been on cog or your own data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m05s)
00:14:05

[do you have a good enough answer or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m07s)
00:14:07

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m11s)
00:14:11

[so we'll talk about that more during the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m12s)
00:14:12

[course and in the end we just have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m14s)
00:14:14

[know that we have good effective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m18s)
00:14:18

[techniques to reliably building baseline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m20s)
00:14:20

[models otherwise yeah there's really no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m23s)
00:14:23

[way to know there's no way other than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m26s)
00:14:26

[creating a cackle competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m28s)
00:14:28

[or getting you know a hundred top data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m30s)
00:14:30

[scientists to work at your problem to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m32s)
00:14:32

[really know what's possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m34s)
00:14:34

[SoCal competitions are fantastic for for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m36s)
00:14:36

[learning and as I've said many times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m39s)
00:14:39

[I've learned more from kept from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m42s)
00:14:42

[competing in cackled competitions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m44s)
00:14:44

[everything else I've done in my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m46s)
00:14:46

[so to compete in the caracal competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[you need the data this one's a an old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m50s)
00:14:50

[competition so it's not running now but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m53s)
00:14:53

[we can still access everything so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h14m55s)
00:14:55

[first of all want to understand what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m00s)
00:15:00

[goal is and I suggest that you read this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m01s)
00:15:01

[later but basically we're to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[predict the sale price of heavy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m06s)
00:15:06

[equipment and one of the nice things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[about this competition is that if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m11s)
00:15:11

[are like me you probably don't know very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[much about heavy heavy industrial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[equipment options right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m19s)
00:15:19

[I actually know more than I used to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m21s)
00:15:21

[because my toddler loves building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[equipment so we actually like watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m24s)
00:15:24

[youtube videos about front end loaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m27s)
00:15:27

[and forklifts but you know two months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m29s)
00:15:29

[ago I was you know a real layman so one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m32s)
00:15:32

[of the nice things is that machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m37s)
00:15:37

[learning should help us understand a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m39s)
00:15:39

[data set not just make predictions about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m41s)
00:15:41

[it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[so by picking an area which we're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[familiar with it's a good test of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m46s)
00:15:46

[whether we can build an understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m47s)
00:15:47

[right because otherwise what can happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m49s)
00:15:49

[is that your intuition about the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m52s)
00:15:52

[can make it very difficult for you to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m54s)
00:15:54

[open-minded enough to see what does the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m56s)
00:15:56

[data really say it's easy enough to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h15m58s)
00:15:58

[download the computer sorry to download](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m01s)
00:16:01

[the data to your computer you just have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m04s)
00:16:04

[to click on the data set so here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m05s)
00:16:05

[train zip and click download right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[so you can go ahead and do that if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m15s)
00:16:15

[you're running on your own computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m16s)
00:16:16

[right now if you're running on AWS it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m16s)
00:16:16

[a little bit harder right because unless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m21s)
00:16:21

[you're familiar with textmode browsers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m23s)
00:16:23

[like a links or links it's quite tricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m25s)
00:16:25

[to get the data set to cable so a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m28s)
00:16:28

[of options one is you could download it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m31s)
00:16:31

[to your computer and then SCP it to AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m34s)
00:16:34

[so SCP works just like SSH but it copies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m38s)
00:16:38

[data rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m41s)
00:16:41

[logging in I'll show you a trick though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m42s)
00:16:42

[that I really like and it relies on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m44s)
00:16:44

[using Firefox for some reason chrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m46s)
00:16:46

[doesn't work correctly with cable for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m50s)
00:16:50

[this so if I go on Firefox to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m52s)
00:16:52

[website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h16m59s)
00:16:59

[eventually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m01s)
00:17:01

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m05s)
00:17:05

[and what we're going to do is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[going to use something called the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m10s)
00:17:10

[JavaScript console so every web browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m12s)
00:17:12

[comes with a set of tools for web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m16s)
00:17:16

[developers to help them see what's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m18s)
00:17:18

[on and you can hit 0 3 here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m21s)
00:17:21

[developer control-shift a okay so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m30s)
00:17:30

[can hit ctrl shift I to bring up this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m34s)
00:17:34

[this web developer tools and one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m39s)
00:17:39

[tabs is network okay and so then if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m42s)
00:17:42

[click on train zip and I click on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m47s)
00:17:47

[download](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m52s)
00:17:52

[okay and I'm not even going to download](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m55s)
00:17:55

[on let's gonna say cancel but you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m57s)
00:17:57

[down here it's shown me all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h17m59s)
00:17:59

[network connections that were just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m01s)
00:18:01

[initiated right and so here's one which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m03s)
00:18:03

[is downloading a zip file from storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m06s)
00:18:06

[Google API is calm blah blah blah that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m08s)
00:18:08

[probably what I want now that looks good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m10s)
00:18:10

[so what you can do is you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[right-click on that and say copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m15s)
00:18:15

[copy as curl so curl is a UNIX command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m19s)
00:18:19

[like W get that downloads stuff right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m23s)
00:18:23

[if I go copy as curl that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m27s)
00:18:27

[create a command that has all of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m30s)
00:18:30

[cookies headers everything in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m33s)
00:18:33

[necessary to download this authenticated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m35s)
00:18:35

[data set so if I now go into my server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m37s)
00:18:37

[right and if I paste that you can see a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m44s)
00:18:44

[really really long curl command one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m48s)
00:18:48

[thing I notice is that at least recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m56s)
00:18:56

[versions have started adding this - -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h18m59s)
00:18:59

[2.0 thing to the command that doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[seem to work with all versions of curl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m04s)
00:19:04

[so something you might want to do is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m06s)
00:19:06

[oopsy-daisy a PE is to pop that into an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m10s)
00:19:10

[editor find that to get rid of it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m18s)
00:19:18

[then use that instead okay now one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m24s)
00:19:24

[to be very careful about by default curl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m28s)
00:19:28

[downloads the file and displays it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m30s)
00:19:30

[your terminal so if I try to display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m35s)
00:19:35

[this it's going to display gigabytes of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[binary data in my terminal and crash it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m39s)
00:19:39

[okay so to say that I want to output it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m41s)
00:19:41

[using some different file name I always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m44s)
00:19:44

[type - o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m47s)
00:19:47

[for output file name and then the name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m47s)
00:19:47

[of the file bulldozers dot and make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m50s)
00:19:50

[you give it a suitable a suitable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m55s)
00:19:55

[extension so in this case the file was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h19m59s)
00:19:59

[train's it okay so bulldozers dot zip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[there it is okay and so there it all is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m10s)
00:20:10

[so I could make directory bulldozers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m14s)
00:20:14

[and I couldn't move my zip file into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m22s)
00:20:22

[there oops wrong way around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m25s)
00:20:25

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m31s)
00:20:31

[yes thank you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m35s)
00:20:35

[ah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m41s)
00:20:41

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m45s)
00:20:45

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m48s)
00:20:48

[okay and then you if you don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h20m58s)
00:20:58

[unzip install you may need to sudo apt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m01s)
00:21:01

[install unzip or if then you're on a Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[that would be brew install unzip if brew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m08s)
00:21:08

[doesn't work you haven't got homebrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m11s)
00:21:11

[installed so make sure you install it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m13s)
00:21:13

[and then unzip okay and so there the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m14s)
00:21:14

[basic steps one nice thing is that if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m19s)
00:21:19

[you're using Kressel most of the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m23s)
00:21:23

[sets should already be pre-installed for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m29s)
00:21:29

[you so what I can do here is I can say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m31s)
00:21:31

[open a new tab here's a cool trick in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m35s)
00:21:35

[Jupiter you can actually say new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m40s)
00:21:40

[terminal and you can actually get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m41s)
00:21:41

[web-based terminal and so you'll find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m44s)
00:21:44

[one cresol there's a slash data sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m47s)
00:21:47

[folder slash data sets flash Cagle slash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m51s)
00:21:51

[data set slash birthday I often the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m56s)
00:21:56

[things you need are going to be in one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h21m58s)
00:21:58

[of those places okay so assuming that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m00s)
00:22:00

[don't have it already downloaded in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m05s)
00:22:05

[paper actually paper space should have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m07s)
00:22:07

[most of them as well then we would need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m09s)
00:22:09

[to go to far say I let's go into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m11s)
00:22:11

[courses machine learning folder and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[I tend to do is I tend to put all of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m17s)
00:22:17

[data for a course into a folder called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m19s)
00:22:19

[data you'll find that if you try and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m22s)
00:22:22

[you're using what we using get right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m26s)
00:22:26

[you'll find that that doesn't get added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m27s)
00:22:27

[to get because it's in the get ignore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m28s)
00:22:28

[right so so don't worry about creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m30s)
00:22:30

[the data folder it's not going to screw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m34s)
00:22:34

[anything up so I generally make a folder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m36s)
00:22:36

[called data and then I tend to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m38s)
00:22:38

[folders for everything I need there so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m40s)
00:22:40

[in this case I'll make bulldozes CD and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m43s)
00:22:43

[remember the last word of the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m51s)
00:22:51

[command is exclamation mark dollar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m53s)
00:22:53

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m55s)
00:22:55

[I'll go ahead and grab that kill command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m57s)
00:22:57

[again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h22m59s)
00:22:59

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m00s)
00:23:00

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m14s)
00:23:14

[okay and zip bulldozers there we go okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m16s)
00:23:16

[so you can now see I generally have like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m24s)
00:23:24

[anything that would change that might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m31s)
00:23:31

[change from person to person I kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m33s)
00:23:33

[put in a constant so here I just defined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m35s)
00:23:35

[something called path but if you've used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m37s)
00:23:37

[the same path I just did just got to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m38s)
00:23:38

[ahead and run that and let's go ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m40s)
00:23:40

[and keep moving along so we've now got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m43s)
00:23:43

[all of our libraries imported and we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m45s)
00:23:45

[said the path to the data you can run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m47s)
00:23:47

[shell commands from within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m55s)
00:23:55

[Tripta notebook by using an exclamation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m57s)
00:23:57

[mark so if I want to check what's inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h23m59s)
00:23:59

[that path I can go LS data slash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m01s)
00:24:01

[bulldozers okay and you can see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m04s)
00:24:04

[works or you can even use Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m07s)
00:24:07

[variables if you use a Python variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m10s)
00:24:10

[inside a Jupiter show command you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m12s)
00:24:12

[to put it in Curly's okay so that makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m14s)
00:24:14

[me feel good that my path is pointing at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m19s)
00:24:19

[the right place if you say LS curly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m21s)
00:24:21

[capital's path and you get nothing at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m23s)
00:24:23

[all then you're pointing at the wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m26s)
00:24:26

[spot yes this up here usually yeah so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m28s)
00:24:28

[the curly brackets refer to the fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m37s)
00:24:37

[that I put an exclamation mark at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m39s)
00:24:39

[front which means the rest of this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m41s)
00:24:41

[not a Python command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m44s)
00:24:44

[it's a bashed command and bash doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m46s)
00:24:46

[know about capital path because capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m49s)
00:24:49

[Park is part of them - so this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[special Jupiter thing which says expand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m54s)
00:24:54

[this Python thing please before you pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h24m57s)
00:24:57

[it to the show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m00s)
00:25:00

[question thank you so the goal here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m03s)
00:25:03

[to use the training set which contains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m15s)
00:25:15

[data through the end of 2011 to predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m19s)
00:25:19

[the sale price of bulldozers and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[main thing to start with then is of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m26s)
00:25:26

[course to look at the data now the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m28s)
00:25:28

[is in CSV format right so one easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m31s)
00:25:31

[to look at the data would be to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m35s)
00:25:35

[shell command head to look at the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m37s)
00:25:37

[two lines paired bulldozers and even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[tab-completion works here Jupiter does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m43s)
00:25:43

[everything right so here's the first few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m45s)
00:25:45

[five lines okay so there's like a bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[of column headers and then there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m52s)
00:25:52

[bunch of data so that's pretty hard to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m53s)
00:25:53

[look at so what we want to do is take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m55s)
00:25:55

[this and read it into a nice tabular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h25m57s)
00:25:57

[format okay so just Terrance putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m00s)
00:26:00

[classes on mean I should make this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m04s)
00:26:04

[bigger or is it okay is this big enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m05s)
00:26:05

[font size okay so this kind of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m07s)
00:26:07

[where you've got columns representing a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m13s)
00:26:13

[wide range of different types of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m16s)
00:26:16

[such as an identifier of value a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m18s)
00:26:18

[currency a date a size I refer to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m20s)
00:26:20

[as structured data now I say I refer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m25s)
00:26:25

[this as structured data because like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m28s)
00:26:28

[there have been many arguments in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m30s)
00:26:30

[machine learning community on Twitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m32s)
00:26:32

[about what is structured data weirdly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[enough this is like the most important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m37s)
00:26:37

[type of distinction is between data that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m39s)
00:26:39

[looks like this and data like images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m42s)
00:26:42

[where every column is of the same type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m45s)
00:26:45

[like that's the most important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m47s)
00:26:47

[distinction in machine learning yet we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m49s)
00:26:49

[don't have standard accepted terms so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m52s)
00:26:52

[I'm going to use the term structured and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m55s)
00:26:55

[unstructured but note that other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m57s)
00:26:57

[you talk to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h26m59s)
00:26:59

[particularly in NLP and NLP people use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m00s)
00:27:00

[structured to mean something totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m04s)
00:27:04

[different right so when I refer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m05s)
00:27:05

[structured data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m08s)
00:27:08

[I mean columns of data that can have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m09s)
00:27:09

[varying different types of data in them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m11s)
00:27:11

[by far the most important tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m13s)
00:27:13

[in Python if you're working with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[structure data is pandas pandas is so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m17s)
00:27:17

[important that it's one of the few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m21s)

[abbreviation for it which is PD so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m24s)
00:27:24

[you'll find that one of the things I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m27s)
00:27:27

[got here is from fast AI imports import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m31s)
00:27:31

[star okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m33s)
00:27:33

[the faster I imports module has nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m36s)
00:27:36

[but imports of a bunch of hopefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m41s)
00:27:41

[useful tools so all of the code for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m44s)
00:27:44

[first AI is inside the fast a I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m50s)
00:27:50

[directory inside the first AI repo and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m53s)
00:27:53

[so you can have a look at imports and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h27m56s)
00:27:56

[you'll see it's just literally a list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m02s)
00:28:02

[inputs and you're fine there pandas as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[PD and so everybody does this right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m08s)
00:28:08

[you'll see lots of people using PD dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[something they're always talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[pandas so pandas lets us read a CSV file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m14s)
00:28:14

[and so when we read the CSV file we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m20s)
00:28:20

[tell it the path to the CSV file a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m24s)
00:28:24

[of any columns that contain dates and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[always add this low-memory equals false](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m31s)
00:28:31

[that's going to actually make it read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m33s)
00:28:33

[more of the file to decide what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m35s)
00:28:35

[types are this here is something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m37s)
00:28:37

[a Python 3.6 format string it's one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m41s)
00:28:41

[the coolest parts of python 3.6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m44s)
00:28:44

[you've probably used lots of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m48s)
00:28:48

[ways in the past in Python of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m50s)
00:28:50

[interpolating variables into your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m51s)
00:28:51

[strings python 3.6 has a very simple way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m53s)
00:28:53

[that you'll probably always want to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m57s)
00:28:57

[from now on and it's you to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h28m58s)
00:28:58

[normal string you type an F for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m00s)
00:29:00

[start and then if I define a variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m03s)
00:29:03

[then I can say hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m09s)
00:29:09

[Curly's - function okay this is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m13s)
00:29:13

[confusing these are not the same Curly's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m20s)
00:29:20

[that we saw earlier on in that LS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m22s)
00:29:22

[command right that LS command is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m24s)
00:29:24

[specific to Jupiter and interpolates -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[code into shell code these Curly's are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m30s)
00:29:30

[Python 3.6 format string Curly's they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m35s)
00:29:35

[require an F at the start so if I get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m38s)
00:29:38

[rid of the F it doesn't interpolate okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m39s)
00:29:39

[so the F tells it to interpolate and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m44s)
00:29:44

[cool thing is inside that Curly's you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m46s)
00:29:46

[can write any Python code you'd like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m50s)
00:29:50

[just about so for example name dot Papa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m52s)
00:29:52

[hello Jeremy okay so I use this all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h29m56s)
00:29:56

[time and it doesn't matter because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m01s)
00:30:01

[a format string it doesn't matter if the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m05s)
00:30:05

[thing was I always forget my age I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m06s)
00:30:06

[I'm 43 it doesn't matter if it's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m11s)
00:30:11

[integer right normally if you like to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[string concatenation with integers place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m16s)
00:30:16

[and complains no such problem here okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[so so this is going to read path slash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[train dot CSV into a thing called a data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m28s)
00:30:28

[frame pandas data frames and hours data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m30s)
00:30:30

[frames are kind of pretty similar so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m36s)
00:30:36

[you've used R before then you'll find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m38s)
00:30:38

[that this is a you know reasonably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[comfortable so this file is nine point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m44s)
00:30:44

[three Meg and it's size is sorry 112 Meg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h30m53s)
00:30:53

[112 Nick and it has 400,000 rows in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m00s)
00:31:00

[okay so it takes a moment to import it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m06s)
00:31:06

[but what it's done we can type the name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m13s)
00:31:13

[of the data frame DF raw and then use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m22s)
00:31:22

[various methods on it so for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m26s)
00:31:26

[deer fur or tail will show us the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m28s)
00:31:28

[few rows of the data frame by default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m31s)
00:31:31

[it's going to show the columns along the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m35s)
00:31:35

[top and the rows down the side but in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m36s)
00:31:36

[this case there's a lot of columns so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m38s)
00:31:38

[I've just said dot transpose to show it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m41s)
00:31:41

[the other way around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m43s)
00:31:43

[I've created one extra function here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m46s)
00:31:46

[display all normally if you just type DF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m48s)
00:31:48

[R or if it's too big to show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m51s)
00:31:51

[conveniently it truncates it and put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m53s)
00:31:53

[little ipsus in the middle so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m56s)
00:31:56

[details don't matter but this is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h31m58s)
00:31:58

[changing your couple of settings to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m00s)
00:32:00

[even if it's got a thousand rows in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m02s)
00:32:02

[thousand columns please still show the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m03s)
00:32:03

[whole thing okay so this is finished I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m06s)
00:32:06

[can actually show you that so if I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m09s)
00:32:09

[type this is really cool in in Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m10s)
00:32:10

[notebook you can type a variable with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m13s)
00:32:13

[almost any kind a video HTML an image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m15s)
00:32:15

[whatever and it'll generally figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m19s)
00:32:19

[a way of displaying it for you okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m21s)
00:32:21

[in this case it's a panda's data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m23s)
00:32:23

[it picks it out a way of just playing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m24s)
00:32:24

[for me and so you can see here that by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m26s)
00:32:26

[default it's actually doesn't show me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[the whole thing so so here's the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m31s)
00:32:31

[set we've got a few different rows this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m36s)
00:32:36

[is the last bit the tail of it alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m40s)
00:32:40

[last few rows this is the thing we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m42s)
00:32:42

[to predict price okay and then all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m45s)
00:32:45

[the other we call this the dependent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m49s)
00:32:49

[variable the dependent variable is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m51s)
00:32:51

[price and then we got a whole bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m53s)
00:32:53

[things we could predict it with and when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m56s)
00:32:56

[I start with a data set I tend yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h32m58s)
00:32:58

[Terrance how can I give you this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m02s)
00:33:02

[hello Jeremy hi Tara I've read in books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m08s)
00:33:08

[that you should never look at the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[because of the risk of overfit why do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m14s)
00:33:14

[you start by looking at the data yeah so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m16s)
00:33:16

[I think she's gonna mention I actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m19s)
00:33:19

[kind of don't like I I want to find out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m21s)
00:33:21

[at least enough to know that I've like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m24s)
00:33:24

[managed to imported okay but I tend not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m26s)
00:33:26

[to really study it at all at this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m28s)
00:33:28

[because I don't want to make too many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m31s)
00:33:31

[assumptions about it I would actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m34s)
00:33:34

[say most books say the opposite most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m36s)
00:33:36

[books do a whole lot of expediate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[exploratory data analysis first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m41s)
00:33:41

[yeah academic books say that that's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m43s)
00:33:43

[of the biggest risks of everything but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m50s)
00:33:50

[the practical books say let's do some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m52s)
00:33:52

[EDA first yeah so that the truth is kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m53s)
00:33:53

[of somewhere in between and I generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m56s)
00:33:56

[I generally try to do machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m57s)
00:33:57

[driven EDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h33m59s)
00:33:59

[and that's what we're going to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m00s)
00:34:00

[today okay so the do thing I do care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m01s)
00:34:01

[about though is what's the purpose of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m08s)
00:34:08

[the project and for capital projects the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m11s)
00:34:11

[purpose is very easy we can just look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[and find out there's always an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m16s)
00:34:16

[evaluation section how is it evaluated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m18s)
00:34:18

[and this is evaluated on root mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m20s)
00:34:20

[squared log error so this means they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m23s)
00:34:23

[going to look at the difference between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m27s)
00:34:27

[the log of our prediction of price and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m28s)
00:34:28

[the log of the actual price and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m30s)
00:34:30

[they're going to square it and addemup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m33s)
00:34:33

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m35s)
00:34:35

[so because they're going to be focusing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m37s)
00:34:37

[on the difference of the logs that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m39s)
00:34:39

[that we should focus on the logs as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m42s)
00:34:42

[and this is pretty common like for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m44s)
00:34:44

[price generally you care not so much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m46s)
00:34:46

[about did I miss by ten dollars but did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m49s)
00:34:49

[I miss by ten percent right so if it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m51s)
00:34:51

[a million dollar thing and you're a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m53s)
00:34:53

[hundred thousand dollars off or if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m55s)
00:34:55

[you're it's a ten thousand dollar thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m56s)
00:34:56

[and you're a thousand dollars off often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h34m57s)
00:34:57

[we would consider those equivalent scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m00s)
00:35:00

[issues and so for this oxygen problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m01s)
00:35:01

[the organizers are telling us they care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m05s)
00:35:05

[about ratios more than differences and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m08s)
00:35:08

[so the log is the thing we care about so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m11s)
00:35:11

[the first thing I do is to take the log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m13s)
00:35:13

[okay now NP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m16s)
00:35:16

[is numpy I'm assuming that you have some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m19s)
00:35:19

[familiarity with numpy if you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m22s)
00:35:22

[we've got a video called deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m24s)
00:35:24

[workshop which actually isn't just for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m26s)
00:35:26

[deep learning it's Rahal it's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m28s)
00:35:28

[for this as well and one of the parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m30s)
00:35:30

[there which we've got a time coded link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m32s)

[to there's a quick introduction to numb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m34s)
00:35:34

[pay but basically numpy lets us treat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m36s)
00:35:36

[arrays matrices vectors high dimensional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m39s)
00:35:39

[chances as if they're Python variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m41s)
00:35:41

[and we can do stuff like log to them and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m45s)
00:35:45

[it'll apply it to everything numpy and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m47s)
00:35:47

[pandas work together very nicely so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m51s)
00:35:51

[this case DF fraud sale price is pulling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m54s)
00:35:54

[a column out of a panda's data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h35m58s)
00:35:58

[which gives us a pandas series right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m01s)
00:36:01

[shows us the sale prices and their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m11s)
00:36:11

[indexes right and a series can be passed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m13s)
00:36:13

[to a number I function okay which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m18s)
00:36:18

[pretty handy and so you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m22s)
00:36:22

[this is how I can replace a column with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m24s)
00:36:24

[a new column pretty easy so okay now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m27s)
00:36:27

[that we've replaced its sale price with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[its log we can go ahead and try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m33s)
00:36:33

[create a random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m35s)
00:36:35

[what's a random forest we'll find out in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m37s)
00:36:37

[detail but in brief a random forest is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m40s)
00:36:40

[kind of universal machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m44s)
00:36:44

[technique it's a way of predicting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m47s)
00:36:47

[something that can be of any kind it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m49s)
00:36:49

[could be a category like is it a dog or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m52s)
00:36:52

[a cat or it could be a continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m55s)
00:36:55

[function you aspera like price it can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h36m57s)
00:36:57

[predict it with columns of pretty much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m02s)
00:37:02

[any kind pixel data zip codes revenues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m04s)
00:37:04

[whatever in general it doesn't overfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m10s)
00:37:10

[it can and will learn to check whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m15s)
00:37:15

[it is but it doesn't generally overfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m18s)
00:37:18

[too badly and it's very very easy to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m20s)
00:37:20

[make to stop it from overfitting you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m22s)
00:37:22

[don't need and we'll talk more about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m25s)
00:37:25

[this you don't need a separate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[validation set in general it can tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m28s)
00:37:28

[you how well it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m30s)
00:37:30

[generalizes even if you only have one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m31s)
00:37:31

[data set it has few if any statistical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m33s)
00:37:33

[assumptions it doesn't assume that your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m37s)
00:37:37

[data is normally distributed it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m39s)
00:37:39

[assume that the relationship so linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m41s)
00:37:41

[it doesn't assume that you've just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m43s)
00:37:43

[specified the interactions it requires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m45s)
00:37:45

[very few pieces of feature engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m49s)
00:37:49

[for many different types of situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[you don't have to take the log of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m55s)
00:37:55

[data you don't have to multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m56s)
00:37:56

[interactions together so in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h37m58s)
00:37:58

[it's a great place to start right if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m00s)
00:38:00

[your first random forest does very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m03s)
00:38:03

[little useful then that's a sign that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[there might be problems with your data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m08s)
00:38:08

[like it's designed to work pretty much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m10s)
00:38:10

[first off can you please throw it out or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m12s)
00:38:12

[towards this gentleman thank you what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m14s)
00:38:14

[about the national year and of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m16s)
00:38:16

[yeah great question so there's this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[concept of curse of dimensionality in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m22s)
00:38:22

[fact there's two concepts I'll touch on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m25s)
00:38:25

[curse of dimensionality and the low free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[lunch theorem these are two concepts you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m29s)
00:38:29

[often hear a lot about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m31s)
00:38:31

[they're both largely meaningless and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m33s)
00:38:33

[basically stupid and yet I would say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m37s)
00:38:37

[maybe the majority of people in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m41s)
00:38:41

[field not only don't know that but think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m43s)
00:38:43

[the opposite so it's well worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m45s)
00:38:45

[explaining the curse of dimensionality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m47s)
00:38:47

[is this idea that the more columns you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m49s)
00:38:49

[have it basically creates a space that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m51s)
00:38:51

[more and more empty and this is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m55s)
00:38:55

[fascinating mathematical idea which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h38m57s)
00:38:57

[the more dimensions you have the more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m00s)
00:39:00

[all of the points sit on the edge of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m03s)
00:39:03

[that space alright so if you've just got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m04s)
00:39:04

[a single dimension where things are like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m06s)
00:39:06

[random then they're spread out all over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m10s)
00:39:10

[right where else if it's a square then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m11s)
00:39:11

[the probability that they're in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m15s)
00:39:15

[middle means that they've kind of been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m16s)
00:39:16

[on the edge of either dimension so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m17s)
00:39:17

[a little bit less likely that they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m20s)
00:39:20

[not on the edge edge dimension you add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m21s)
00:39:21

[it becomes more addictive ly less likely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m23s)
00:39:23

[that the point isn't on the edge of at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m26s)
00:39:26

[least one dimension right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m28s)
00:39:28

[basically in high dimensions everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m30s)
00:39:30

[sits on the edge and what that means in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m32s)
00:39:32

[theory is that the distance between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m35s)
00:39:35

[points is much less meaningful and so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m36s)
00:39:36

[we assume that somehow that matters that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m40s)
00:39:40

[it would suggest that when you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m43s)
00:39:43

[lots of columns and you just use them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m45s)
00:39:45

[without being very careful to remove the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m48s)
00:39:48

[ones you don't care about that somehow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m50s)
00:39:50

[things won't work that turns out just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m52s)
00:39:52

[not to be the case it's not the case for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m56s)
00:39:56

[a number of reasons one is that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h39m59s)
00:39:59

[points still do have different distances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m02s)
00:40:02

[away from each other just because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m04s)
00:40:04

[they're on the edge they still do vary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m06s)
00:40:06

[and far where they are from each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m08s)
00:40:08

[and so this point is more similar at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m10s)
00:40:10

[this point that it is to that point so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m12s)
00:40:12

[even things will learn about K nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m14s)
00:40:14

[neighbors actually work really well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m15s)
00:40:15

[really really well in high dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m17s)
00:40:17

[despite what the theoreticians claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m19s)
00:40:19

[and what really happened here was that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m22s)
00:40:22

[in the 90s theory totally took over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m24s)
00:40:24

[machine learning and so particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[there was this concept of these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m32s)
00:40:32

[called support vector machines that were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[theoretically very well justified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m34s)
00:40:34

[extremely easy to analyze mathematically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[and you could like kind of prove things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m38s)
00:40:38

[about them and we kind of lost a decade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m41s)
00:40:41

[of real practical development in my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m44s)
00:40:44

[opinion and all these theories became](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[techniques actually work and it turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m00s)

[out that in practice building models on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m01s)
00:41:01

[lots and lots of columns works really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m04s)
00:41:04

[really well so yeah the other thing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m06s)

[mathematical sense any random data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m29s)
00:41:29

[by definition is random right so there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m33s)
00:41:33

[isn't going to be some way of looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m36s)
00:41:36

[every possible random data set that's in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m37s)
00:41:37

[some way more useful than any other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m39s)
00:41:39

[approach in the real world we look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m41s)
00:41:41

[data which is not random mathematically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[we would say it sits on some lower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m47s)
00:41:47

[dimensional manifold it was created by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m49s)
00:41:49

[some kind of caused all structure there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m51s)
00:41:51

[are some relationships in there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m54s)
00:41:54

[so the truth is that we're not using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m57s)
00:41:57

[random datasets and so the truth is in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h41m59s)
00:41:59

[the real world there are actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m01s)
00:42:01

[techniques that work much better than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m03s)
00:42:03

[other techniques for nearly all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m06s)
00:42:06

[datasets you look at and nowadays there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m08s)
00:42:08

[are empirical researchers who spend a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m11s)
00:42:11

[lot of time studying this which is which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m14s)
00:42:14

[techniques work a lot of the time and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[ensembles of decision trees with which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m21s)
00:42:21

[random for a one is perhaps the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m23s)
00:42:23

[technique which most often comes at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m27s)
00:42:27

[top and that is despite the fact that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m28s)
00:42:28

[until the library that we're showing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m32s)
00:42:32

[today first day I came along there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m34s)
00:42:34

[wasn't really any standard way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[pre-process them properly and to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m37s)
00:42:37

[properly set their parameters so I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m40s)
00:42:40

[it's even more strong than that so yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m43s)
00:42:43

[I think this is where the difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m48s)
00:42:48

[between theory and practice is is is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m49s)
00:42:49

[huge so when I try to create a ratso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m52s)
00:42:52

[random forest regressor what is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m56s)
00:42:56

[random forest regressor okay it's part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h42m58s)
00:42:58

[of something called SK learn SK learn is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m01s)
00:43:01

[scikit-learn it is by far the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m04s)
00:43:04

[popular and important package for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m06s)
00:43:06

[machine learning in python it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m09s)
00:43:09

[nearly everything it's not the best at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m11s)
00:43:11

[nearly everything but it's perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m14s)
00:43:14

[good at nearly everything so like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m16s)
00:43:16

[might find in the next part of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m19s)
00:43:19

[course with your net you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m21s)
00:43:21

[look at a different kind of decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[tree ensemble called gradient roost in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[trees where actually there's something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m25s)
00:43:25

[called x3 boost which is better than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m29s)
00:43:29

[gradient boosting trees in psyche alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m31s)
00:43:31

[but it's pretty good at everything so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m34s)
00:43:34

[where I'm really going to focus on cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m36s)
00:43:36

[in random forests you can do two kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m39s)
00:43:39

[of things with a random forest if I hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m42s)
00:43:42

[tab I haven't imported it so let's go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[back to where we import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m49s)
00:43:49

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m51s)
00:43:51

[so you can hit tab in Jupiter notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h43m57s)
00:43:57

[to get tab-completion for anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m01s)
00:44:01

[that's in your environment you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m02s)
00:44:02

[that there's also a random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[classifier so in general there's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m07s)
00:44:07

[important distinction between things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[which can predict continuous variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[that's called regression and therefore a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m15s)
00:44:15

[method for doing that would be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m18s)
00:44:18

[regresar and things that predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m19s)
00:44:19

[categorical variables and that is called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m22s)
00:44:22

[classification and the things that do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m25s)
00:44:25

[that are called plasa fires now so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m28s)
00:44:28

[our case we're trying to predict a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m30s)
00:44:30

[continuous variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m32s)
00:44:32

[pres so therefore we are doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m33s)
00:44:33

[regression and therefore we need a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m35s)
00:44:35

[regress or a lot of people incorrectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m37s)
00:44:37

[use the word regression to refer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m41s)
00:44:41

[linear regression now it is just not at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m43s)
00:44:43

[all true or appropriate regression means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m46s)
00:44:46

[an assumed learning model that's trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m48s)
00:44:48

[to predict some kind of continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m50s)
00:44:50

[outcome it has a continuous dependent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m52s)
00:44:52

[variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[so pretty much everything in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[scikit-learn has the same form you first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h44m58s)
00:44:58

[of all create an instance of an object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m00s)
00:45:00

[for the machine learning model you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m02s)
00:45:02

[you then call fit passing in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m04s)
00:45:04

[independent variables the things you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m07s)
00:45:07

[gonna use to predict and the dependent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m10s)
00:45:10

[variable the thing that you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m11s)
00:45:11

[predict so in our case the dependent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m13s)
00:45:13

[variable is is the data frames sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m15s)
00:45:15

[price column and so we the thing we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m22s)
00:45:22

[to use to predict is everything except](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m25s)
00:45:25

[that in pandas the drop method returns a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m27s)
00:45:27

[new data frame with a list of columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m31s)
00:45:31

[removed right well a list of rows or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m33s)
00:45:33

[columns removed so access equals 1 means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m36s)
00:45:36

[removed columns so this here is the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m39s)
00:45:39

[frame containing everything except for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m41s)
00:45:41

[sale price okay so you just pass a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m43s)
00:45:43

[let's find out so to find out I could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h45m58s)
00:45:58

[hit shift tab and that will bring up the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m01s)
00:46:01

[you know a quick inspection of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m06s)
00:46:06

[parameters in this case it doesn't quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m08s)
00:46:08

[tell me what I want so if I hit shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m09s)
00:46:09

[tab twice it gives me a bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m12s)
00:46:12

[information yes and that tells me it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m15s)
00:46:15

[single label or list like list like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m18s)
00:46:18

[means like anything you can index in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m21s)
00:46:21

[Python there's lots of things by the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m23s)
00:46:23

[if I hit three times it will give me a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m25s)
00:46:25

[whole little window at the bottom okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m28s)
00:46:28

[so that was shift tab another way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[doing that of course which we learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m33s)
00:46:33

[would be question mark question mark DF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m35s)
00:46:35

[bra drop okay sorry question mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m37s)
00:46:37

[question mark would be the source code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m45s)
00:46:45

[for it for a single question mark is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m47s)
00:46:47

[documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m51s)
00:46:51

[so I think that trick of like tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m53s)
00:46:53

[complete shift-tab parameters question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m56s)
00:46:56

[mark and double question mark for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h46m59s)
00:46:59

[docs and the source code like if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m01s)
00:47:01

[know nothing else about using Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m03s)
00:47:03

[libraries know that because now you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m05s)
00:47:05

[how to find out everything else okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m08s)
00:47:08

[we try to run it and it doesn't work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m11s)
00:47:11

[okay so why didn't it work so anytime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m15s)
00:47:15

[you get a stack trace like this so an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m18s)
00:47:18

[error the trick is to go to the bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m22s)
00:47:22

[because the bottom tells you what went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m24s)
00:47:24

[wrong a buffer it tells you all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m25s)
00:47:25

[functions the court other function could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m28s)
00:47:28

[cause other functions to get there could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m29s)
00:47:29

[not convert string to float conventional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m32s)
00:47:32

[so there was a column name sorry a there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m35s)
00:47:35

[was a value rather inside my data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m38s)
00:47:38

[conventional the word conventional and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m40s)
00:47:40

[it didn't know how to create a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m42s)
00:47:42

[using that string now that's true we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m44s)
00:47:44

[have to pass numbers to most machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m49s)
00:47:49

[learning models and certainly to random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m52s)
00:47:52

[forests so step one is to convert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m56s)
00:47:56

[everything into numbers so our data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h47m57s)
00:47:57

[contains both continuous variables so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m03s)
00:48:03

[numbers where the meaning is numeric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[like price and it contains categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m08s)
00:48:08

[variables which could either be numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m14s)
00:48:14

[where the meaning is not continuous like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m16s)
00:48:16

[zip code or it could be a string like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m19s)
00:48:19

[large small and medium it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m22s)
00:48:22

[categorical and continuous variables we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m25s)
00:48:25

[want to basically get to a point where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m28s)
00:48:28

[we have a data set where we can use all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m30s)
00:48:30

[of these variables so they have to all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m32s)
00:48:32

[be numeric and they have to be usable in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m34s)
00:48:34

[some way so one issue is that we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m36s)
00:48:36

[something called say all date which you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m38s)
00:48:38

[might remember right at the top we told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m43s)
00:48:43

[it that that's a date so it's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m45s)
00:48:45

[passed as a date and so you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m46s)
00:48:46

[it's Dana type D type very important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m49s)
00:48:49

[thing data type is date/time 64-bit so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m52s)
00:48:52

[that's not a number right and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h48m57s)
00:48:57

[actually where we need to do our first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m00s)
00:49:00

[piece of feature engineering right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m02s)
00:49:02

[inside a date there's a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m03s)
00:49:03

[interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m06s)
00:49:06

[all right so since you've got the catch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m08s)
00:49:08

[box can you tell me what are some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m10s)
00:49:10

[interesting bits of information inside a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m11s)
00:49:11

[date what we can see like a time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m14s)
00:49:14

[that's true I'm hadn't expressed for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m20s)
00:49:20

[real what are some columns that we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m23s)
00:49:23

[pull out of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m25s)
00:49:25

[yeah month the date as in like it come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m27s)
00:49:27

[Ian at least to be a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m32s)
00:49:32

[yeah month quarter you're a pleasure to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m33s)
00:49:33

[your right and get some more behind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m36s)
00:49:36

[just pass it to your right you go you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m38s)
00:49:38

[got some more columns for us the day of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m41s)
00:49:41

[month yeah keep going to the right yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m46s)
00:49:46

[week 30 of week yeah week of here yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m49s)
00:49:49

[okay I'll give you a few more like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h49m59s)
00:49:59

[you might want to think about would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m01s)
00:50:01

[like is it a holiday is it a weekend was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[it raining that day was there a sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m10s)
00:50:10

[event that day like it depends a bit on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m13s)
00:50:13

[what you're doing right so like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m16s)
00:50:16

[you're predicting soda sales in soma you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m18s)
00:50:18

[would probably want to know was there a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[San Francisco Giants ball game on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m25s)
00:50:25

[day right so like what's in a date is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m27s)
00:50:27

[one of the most important pieces of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[feature engineering you can do and no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[machine learning algorithm can tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m34s)
00:50:34

[whether the Giants were playing that day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m37s)
00:50:37

[and that it was important right so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m39s)
00:50:39

[is where you need to do feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m42s)
00:50:42

[engineering so I to as much things as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m43s)
00:50:43

[many things automatically as I can for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m47s)
00:50:47

[you right so here I've got something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m50s)
00:50:50

[called add date pad what is that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m53s)
00:50:53

[something inside fast AI dot structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h50m58s)
00:50:58

[okay and what is it well let's read the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m01s)
00:51:01

[source code here it is so you'll find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m05s)
00:51:05

[most of my functions are less than half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m09s)
00:51:09

[a page of code alright so here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[something it's going to so rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m15s)
00:51:15

[often rather than having Docs I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m17s)
00:51:17

[to try to add Doc's over time but that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m18s)
00:51:18

[is their design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[you can understand them I reading the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m21s)
00:51:21

[code so we're passing in a data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m22s)
00:51:22

[and the name of some field okay which in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m24s)
00:51:24

[this case was sale date and so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m27s)
00:51:27

[case we can't go D F dot field name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m31s)
00:51:31

[because that would actually find a field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m33s)
00:51:33

[called field name it literally so DF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m35s)
00:51:35

[square bracket field name is how we grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m39s)
00:51:39

[a column where that column name is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m41s)
00:51:41

[stored in this variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m43s)
00:51:43

[okay so we've now got the field itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m44s)
00:51:44

[the series yeah and so what we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m46s)
00:51:46

[to do is we're going to go through all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m49s)
00:51:49

[of these different strings right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m51s)
00:51:51

[this is a piece of Python which actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m53s)
00:51:53

[looks inside an object and finds a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h51m56s)
00:51:56

[attribute with that name so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m00s)
00:52:00

[going to go through and you can again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m02s)
00:52:02

[you can google for Pais and get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m04s)
00:52:04

[attribute it's a cool little advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m05s)
00:52:05

[technique but this is going to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m08s)
00:52:08

[through it's going to find for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m09s)
00:52:09

[field it's going to find its Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m11s)
00:52:11

[attribute now planter's has got this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m14s)
00:52:14

[interesting idea which is if I actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m17s)
00:52:17

[look inside let's go field equals this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m19s)
00:52:19

[is the kind of experiment I want you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m23s)
00:52:23

[do right play around say all date okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m25s)
00:52:25

[so I've now got that in a field object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m27s)
00:52:27

[and so I can go field right and I can go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m29s)
00:52:29

[field dot tab okay and let's see is year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m32s)
00:52:32

[in there oh it's not okay why not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m37s)
00:52:37

[well that's because year is only going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m40s)
00:52:40

[to apply to pandas series that date time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m43s)
00:52:43

[objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m46s)
00:52:46

[so what pandas does is it lets out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m47s)
00:52:47

[different methods inside attributes that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m50s)
00:52:50

[are specific to what they are so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m53s)
00:52:53

[date/time objects will have a DT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m55s)
00:52:55

[attribute defined and at that is where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h52m58s)
00:52:58

[you'll find all the date/time specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m02s)
00:53:02

[stuff so what I went through was I went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m03s)
00:53:03

[through all of these and picked out all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m08s)
00:53:08

[of the ones that could ever be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m10s)
00:53:10

[interesting for having any reason right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[and this is like the opposite of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m13s)
00:53:13

[curse of dimensionality it's like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m15s)
00:53:15

[there is any column or any variant of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m17s)
00:53:17

[that column that could be ever be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m20s)
00:53:20

[interesting at all add that to your data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m21s)
00:53:21

[set and every variation of it you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[think of there's no harm in adding more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m26s)
00:53:26

[columns nearly all the time right so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m28s)
00:53:28

[this case we're going to go ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m32s)
00:53:32

[all of these different attributes and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m34s)
00:53:34

[for every one I'm going to create a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m37s)
00:53:37

[field that's going to be called the name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m39s)
00:53:39

[of your field with the word date removed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m45s)
00:53:45

[sort of a sale and then the name of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m47s)
00:53:47

[attribute so we're going to get a sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m50s)
00:53:50

[year sale months so a week say all day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m52s)
00:53:52

[etc etc okay and then at the very end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m54s)
00:53:54

[I'm going to remove the original field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h53m57s)
00:53:57

[right because remember we can't use say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m00s)
00:54:00

[all date directly because it's not a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m03s)
00:54:03

[number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m04s)
00:54:04

[so your sickness only worked because it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m12s)
00:54:12

[was a date type did you make the data it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m13s)
00:54:13

[was already saved as one in the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m16s)
00:54:16

[yeah it's already a date type and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m17s)
00:54:17

[reason it was a date tonight is because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m20s)
00:54:20

[when we imported it we said PA's dates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m23s)
00:54:23

[equals and told pandas it's a date type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m28s)
00:54:28

[so as long as it looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m30s)
00:54:30

[date-ish and we tell it to parse it as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m32s)
00:54:32

[date if you don't have an intranet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m36s)
00:54:36

[i I think there might be but for some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m45s)
00:54:45

[reason it wasn't ideal like maybe it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m47s)
00:54:47

[took lots of time or it didn't always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m49s)
00:54:49

[work or for some reason I had to list it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m51s)
00:54:51

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m55s)
00:54:55

[I would suggest checking out the docs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m56s)
00:54:56

[for pandas don't read CSV and maybe on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h54m58s)
00:54:58

[the forum you can tell us what you find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m00s)
00:55:00

[because I can't remember offhand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m02s)
00:55:02

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m08s)
00:55:08

[I got telephoning so how about the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m10s)
00:55:10

[zone let's do that one on the same forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m14s)
00:55:14

[thread that savanah creates because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m21s)
00:55:21

[think it's a reasonably advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m22s)
00:55:22

[question but generally speaking the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m24s)
00:55:24

[zone in a properly formatted date will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m27s)
00:55:27

[be included in the string and it should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m29s)
00:55:29

[format it it should pull it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m31s)
00:55:31

[correctly and turn it into a universal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m33s)
00:55:33

[time zone so generally speaking it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m35s)
00:55:35

[should handle it for you so I noticed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m37s)
00:55:37

[you for indexing a column to shrink when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m43s)
00:55:43

[we use the is there any consideration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m46s)
00:55:46

[the square brackets one is safer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m53s)
00:55:53

[particularly if you're assigning to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m55s)
00:55:55

[column if it didn't already exist you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h55m58s)
00:55:58

[need to use the square brackets format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m01s)
00:56:01

[otherwise you'll get weird errors so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m02s)
00:56:02

[square brackets format is sofa the dart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m04s)
00:56:04

[version saves me like a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m07s)
00:56:07

[keystrokes so I probably use it more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m09s)
00:56:09

[than I should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m11s)
00:56:11

[in this particular case because I wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m11s)
00:56:11

[to grab something that was had field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m17s)
00:56:17

[name was had something inside it wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m20s)
00:56:20

[the name itself I have to use square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m22s)
00:56:22

[brackets so square brackets is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m24s)
00:56:24

[be your your safe bet if in doubt so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m27s)
00:56:27

[after I run that you'll notice that DF r](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m32s)
00:56:32

[or dark columns gives me a list of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m39s)
00:56:39

[of the columns just as strings and at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m42s)
00:56:42

[the end there they all are right so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m45s)
00:56:45

[removed sale date and it's added all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m47s)
00:56:47

[those so that's not quite enough the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m49s)
00:56:49

[other problem is that we've got a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m53s)
00:56:53

[bunch of strings in there right so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h56m56s)
00:56:56

[can just think that they're doing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m02s)
00:57:02

[pass a bet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m03s)
00:57:03

[so is like low high medium thank you so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m09s)
00:57:09

[a panda's actually has a concept with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[category data type but by default it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m20s)
00:57:20

[doesn't turn anything into a category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m23s)
00:57:23

[for you so I've created something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m25s)
00:57:25

[Train cats which creates categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m27s)
00:57:27

[variables for everything that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m33s)
00:57:33

[string okay and so what that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m35s)
00:57:35

[do is behind the scenes it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m37s)
00:57:37

[create a column that's actually a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m40s)
00:57:40

[right as an integer and it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m42s)
00:57:42

[store a mapping from the integers to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m44s)
00:57:44

[streets okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m47s)
00:57:47

[the reason it's trained cats as it uses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[for the training set more advanced usage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[is that when we get to looking at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m54s)
00:57:54

[test and validation sets this is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m56s)
00:57:56

[important idea in fact Terrence came to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h57m58s)
00:57:58

[me the other day and he said my models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m02s)
00:58:02

[not working why not and he figured it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m04s)
00:58:04

[out for himself it turned out the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m07s)
00:58:07

[why was because the mappings he was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m09s)
00:58:09

[using from string to number in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m11s)
00:58:11

[training set were different to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m12s)
00:58:12

[mappings he was using from string to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m14s)
00:58:14

[number in the test set so therefore in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m16s)
00:58:16

[the training set hi might have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m18s)
00:58:18

[three but in the trait test set it might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m21s)
00:58:21

[have been two so the two were totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m23s)
00:58:23

[different and so the model was basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m26s)
00:58:26

[non predictive okay so I have another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m28s)
00:58:28

[function called apply categories where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m31s)
00:58:31

[you can pass in your existing training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m37s)
00:58:37

[set and it all use the same mappings to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m39s)
00:58:39

[let you all make sure your test set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m42s)
00:58:42

[validation set uses the same mappings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m44s)
00:58:44

[okay so when I go trained cats it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m45s)
00:58:45

[actually not going to make the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[frame look different at all but behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m50s)
00:58:50

[the scenes it's going to turn them all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m53s)
00:58:53

[into numbers when we finish at 12 11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h58m54s)
00:58:54

[let's see here we go I'll try to finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m08s)
00:59:08

[on time so you'll see now remember I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m11s)
00:59:11

[mentioned there was this dot DT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m13s)
00:59:13

[attribute that gives you access to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m15s)
00:59:15

[everything assuming it's a date time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m16s)
00:59:16

[about the date time there's a dot count](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m18s)
00:59:18

[attribute that gives you access to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m20s)
00:59:20

[things as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m21s)
00:59:21

[something's a category all right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m22s)
00:59:22

[usage banned was a string and so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m25s)
00:59:25

[that I've run train cats it's turned it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[into a category so I can go to your or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m29s)
00:59:29

[usage banned cat right and there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m33s)
00:59:33

[whole bunch of other things we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m37s)
00:59:37

[there okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m38s)
00:59:38

[so one of the things we've got there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m40s)
00:59:40

[dot categories and you can see here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m42s)
00:59:42

[the list now one of the things you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m44s)
00:59:44

[notice it's that this list is in a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m47s)
00:59:47

[of a weird order high low medium the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m49s)
00:59:49

[truth is it doesn't matter too much but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m52s)
00:59:52

[what's going to happen when we use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m55s)
00:59:55

[random forest is it's actually good that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m57s)
00:59:57

[this is going to be 0 this is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=00h59m59s)
00:59:59

[be 1 this is gonna be true and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m00s)
01:00:00

[going to be creating decision trees and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m02s)
01:00:02

[so we're going to have a decision tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m04s)
01:00:04

[that can split things at a single point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[so it either be high versus low and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m07s)
01:00:07

[medium or medium versus high and low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m10s)
01:00:10

[that would be kind of weird right it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m13s)
01:00:13

[actually turns out not to work too badly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m15s)
01:00:15

[but it'll work a little bit better if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m17s)
01:00:17

[you have these in sensible orders okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m19s)
01:00:19

[so if you want to reorder a category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m22s)
01:00:22

[then you can just go caps net categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m23s)
01:00:23

[and pass in the order you want until it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[is ordered and almost every pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m30s)
01:00:30

[method has an in-place parameter which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m32s)
01:00:32

[rather than returning a new data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m37s)
01:00:37

[is going to change that data frame okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m39s)
01:00:39

[so I'm not going to do that like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m41s)
01:00:41

[didn't check that carefully for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m43s)
01:00:43

[categories it should be ordered but this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m44s)
01:00:44

[seems like a pretty obvious one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m45s)
01:00:45

[you reiterate that issue I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m52s)
01:00:52

[understand what the chart so um the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m54s)
01:00:54

[usage banned column it's actually going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h00m58s)
01:00:58

[to be this is actually what I random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m06s)
01:01:06

[forest is gonna see these numbers one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m13s)
01:01:13

[zero two one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m16s)
01:01:16

[okay and they map to the position in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m17s)
01:01:17

[this array and as we're going to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m19s)
01:01:19

[shortly a random forest consists of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m20s)
01:01:20

[bunch of trees it's going to make a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m23s)
01:01:23

[single split and the single split is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m24s)
01:01:24

[going to be either greater than or less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m27s)
01:01:27

[than 1 or greater than a less than two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m29s)
01:01:29

[right so we could split it into high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m32s)
01:01:32

[versus low and medium which that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m36s)
01:01:36

[semantically makes sense it's like is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m39s)
01:01:39

[big or we could split it into medium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m41s)
01:01:41

[versus high and low it doesn't make much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m44s)
01:01:44

[sense right so in practice the decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m47s)
01:01:47

[tree could then make a second split to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m50s)
01:01:50

[say like medium versus high and low and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m52s)
01:01:52

[then within the high and low into high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m54s)
01:01:54

[and low but by putting it in a sensible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m55s)
01:01:55

[order if it wants to spit out low it can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h01m58s)
01:01:58

[do it in one decision rather than two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m00s)
01:02:00

[and we'll be learning more about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m03s)
01:02:03

[shortly it's it honestly it's not a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m05s)
01:02:05

[deal but I just wanted to mention it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m08s)
01:02:08

[there and it's also good to know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m09s)
01:02:09

[people when they talk about like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m13s)
01:02:13

[different types of categorical variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m15s)
01:02:15

[specifically you need to know there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m17s)
01:02:17

[kind of categorical variable called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m18s)
01:02:18

[ordinal and an ordinal categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m20s)
01:02:20

[variable is one that has some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m22s)
01:02:22

[order like high medium and low okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m24s)
01:02:24

[random forests are terribly sensitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m27s)
01:02:27

[for that fact but it's worth noting it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m30s)
01:02:30

[there and trying it out still ordering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m34s)
01:02:34

[wouldn't sell for maximum that that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m39s)
01:02:39

[what I'm saying it helps a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m42s)
01:02:42

[right it means you can get there with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m43s)
01:02:43

[one decision rather than two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m45s)
01:02:45

[I noticed there is a negative one in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m48s)
01:02:48

[that list of categories is that like an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m51s)
01:02:51

[NA yeah exactly so for free we get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m53s)
01:02:53

[negative one which prefers to missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[and what are the things we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m00s)
01:03:00

[do is we're going to actually add one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[can somebody pass the vector Paul is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m03s)
01:03:03

[we're going to add one to our codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m04s)
01:03:04

[maybe in two guys let people know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m06s)
01:03:06

[coming yeah so let people know we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m10s)
01:03:10

[going to add one to all of our codes to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m14s)
01:03:14

[make missing a zero later on yeah we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m16s)
01:03:16

[going to get to that yeah yeah so get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m34s)
01:03:34

[dummies which we'll get to in a moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m37s)
01:03:37

[is going to create three separate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m38s)
01:03:38

[columns ones and zeros for high once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m39s)
01:03:39

[there's a million ones in series for low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m42s)
01:03:42

[where else this one creates a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m43s)
01:03:43

[column with an integer zero one or two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[we're going to get to that one shortly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m49s)
01:03:49

[yep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m51s)
01:03:51

[did you have a question to Paul or just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[pointing out okay okay so at this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m54s)
01:03:54

[as long as we always make sure we use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h03m58s)
01:03:58

[dot cat codes the thing with the numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m01s)
01:04:01

[in we're basically done all of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m04s)
01:04:04

[streams have been turned into numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m07s)
01:04:07

[dates been turned into a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m09s)
01:04:09

[numeric columns and everything else is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m11s)
01:04:11

[already a number okay the only other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m12s)
01:04:12

[main thing we have to do is notice that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m16s)
01:04:16

[we have lots of missing values so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m19s)
01:04:19

[is DFA is null that's going to return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m21s)
01:04:21

[true or false depending on whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m25s)
01:04:25

[something is empty dot some is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m27s)
01:04:27

[add up how many empty for each series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m32s)
01:04:32

[and then I'm going to sort them and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m35s)
01:04:35

[divide by the size of the data set so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m37s)
01:04:37

[here we have some things which have like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m41s)
01:04:41

[quite high percentages of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m44s)
01:04:44

[Nantz sir so missing values we call them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m47s)
01:04:47

[in play or what I call it maybe I didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m51s)
01:04:51

[run it there we go okay so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h04m59s)
01:04:59

[to get to that in a moment but I will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m10s)
01:05:10

[point something out which is reading the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m11s)
01:05:11

[CSV talk a minute or so the processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m13s)
01:05:13

[took another ten seconds or so from time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m16s)
01:05:16

[to time when I've done a little bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m19s)
01:05:19

[work I don't want to wait for again I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m20s)
01:05:20

[will tend to save where I'm at so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m21s)
01:05:21

[I'm going to save it and I got to save](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m24s)
01:05:24

[it in a format called feather format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m25s)
01:05:25

[this is very very new all right but what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m27s)
01:05:27

[this is going to do is it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m29s)
01:05:29

[save it to disk in exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[basic format but it's actually in RAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m32s)
01:05:32

[this is by far the fastest way to save](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m34s)
01:05:34

[something in the fastest way to read it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m37s)
01:05:37

[back right so most of the folks you deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m39s)
01:05:39

[with unless they're on the cutting edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m41s)
01:05:41

[won't be familiar with this format so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m43s)
01:05:43

[this would be something you can teach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m45s)
01:05:45

[them about it's becoming the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m46s)
01:05:46

[right it's actually becoming something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m48s)
01:05:48

[that's going to be used not just in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[pandas but in Java in spark in lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m52s)
01:05:52

[like things for like communicating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h05m58s)
01:05:58

[across computers because it's incredibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m00s)
01:06:00

[fast and it's actually co-designed by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m02s)
01:06:02

[the guy that made Panthers by where's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m05s)
01:06:05

[McKinney so we can just go deer 4.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m06s)
01:06:06

[feather and pass in some name I tend to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m10s)
01:06:10

[have a folder called temp for all of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m15s)
01:06:15

[like as I'm going along stuff and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m18s)
01:06:18

[when you go OS don't make do as you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m22s)
01:06:22

[pass in any path path here you like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m24s)
01:06:24

[won't complain if it's already there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m26s)
01:06:26

[exists okay equals true if there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m28s)
01:06:28

[some sub directories it'll create them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m30s)
01:06:30

[for you so this is a super handy little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m32s)
01:06:32

[function okay so it's not installed so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[because I'm using Kressel for the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m41s)
01:06:41

[time it's complaining about that so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m44s)
01:06:44

[you get a message that something's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[installed if you're using anaconda you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m48s)
01:06:48

[can condor install Kressel actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m51s)
01:06:51

[doesn't use anaconda it uses a pit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m54s)
01:06:54

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h06m56s)
01:06:56

[and so we wait for that to go along okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m07s)
01:07:07

[and so now if I run it and so sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m10s)
01:07:10

[you may find you actually have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m18s)
01:07:18

[restart Jupiter so I won't do that now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m21s)
01:07:21

[it's really out of time so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m24s)
01:07:24

[restart Jupiter you'll be able to keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m25s)
01:07:25

[moving a lot so from now on you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m27s)
01:07:27

[have to rerun all the stuff they love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m30s)
01:07:30

[you could just say PD don't read further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[and we've got our data frame back so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m34s)
01:07:34

[last step we're going to do is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m38s)
01:07:38

[actually replace the strings with their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m42s)
01:07:42

[numeric codes and we're going to pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m45s)
01:07:45

[out the dependent variable sale price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[into a separate variable and we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m51s)
01:07:51

[to also handle missing continuous values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m53s)
01:07:53

[and so how are we going to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m55s)
01:07:55

[so you'll see here we've got a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h07m58s)
01:07:58

[called proc DF what is that croc DF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m02s)
01:08:02

[so it's in so fast AI dot structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m08s)
01:08:08

[again and here it is so quite a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m10s)
01:08:10

[the functions have a few additional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m23s)
01:08:23

[parameters that you can provide and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m25s)
01:08:25

[we'll talk about them later but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m27s)
01:08:27

[basically we're providing the data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m28s)
01:08:28

[to process and the name of the dependent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m29s)
01:08:29

[variable that the the Y field name okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m31s)
01:08:31

[and so what it's going to do is it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m35s)
01:08:35

[going to make a copy of the data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m37s)
01:08:37

[it's going to grab the Y value it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m39s)
01:08:39

[going to drop the dependent variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m44s)
01:08:44

[from the original and then it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m46s)
01:08:46

[fix missing so how do we fix missing so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m52s)
01:08:52

[what we do to fix missing is pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h08m58s)
01:08:58

[simple if it's numeric then we fix it by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m00s)
01:09:00

[basically saying let's first of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m06s)
01:09:06

[check that it does have some missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m08s)
01:09:08

[right so if it does have some missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m10s)
01:09:10

[values so in other words the is not some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m12s)
01:09:12

[is nonzero then we're going to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m14s)
01:09:14

[new column called with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m17s)
01:09:17

[name as the original plus underscore na](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m19s)
01:09:19

[and it's going to be a bullion column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m21s)
01:09:21

[with a 1 anytime that was missing and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m23s)
01:09:23

[0 anytime it wasn't we're going to talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m27s)
01:09:27

[about this again next week but this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m29s)
01:09:29

[you know give you the quick version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m31s)
01:09:31

[having done that where they're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m32s)
01:09:32

[replace the NA s the missing with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m34s)
01:09:34

[median](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m38s)
01:09:38

[okay so anywhere that used to be missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m38s)
01:09:38

[will be replaced with the median or add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m40s)
01:09:40

[a new column to tell us which ones were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m42s)
01:09:42

[missing we only do that for numeric we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m45s)
01:09:45

[don't need it for categories because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m47s)
01:09:47

[pandas had is handles categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[variables automatically by setting them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m51s)
01:09:51

[to minus one so what we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m53s)
01:09:53

[is if it's not numeric and it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h09m59s)
01:09:59

[categorical type we'll talk about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m05s)
01:10:05

[maximum number of categories later but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m07s)
01:10:07

[lets us units is always true so if it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m09s)
01:10:09

[not a numeric type we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m10s)
01:10:10

[replace the column with its codes the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[integers okay plus one right so the by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m15s)
01:10:15

[default pandas uses minus one for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m19s)
01:10:19

[missing so now zero will be missing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[one two three four will be all the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m25s)
01:10:25

[categories so we're going to talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m27s)
01:10:27

[dummies later on in the course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m33s)
01:10:33

[but basically optionally you can say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m35s)
01:10:35

[that if you already know about dummy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m38s)
01:10:38

[values there are columns with a small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m39s)
01:10:39

[number of possible values you can put in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m41s)
01:10:41

[two dummies instead you can America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m43s)
01:10:43

[lysing them but we're not going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m45s)
01:10:45

[that for now okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m46s)
01:10:46

[so for now all we're doing is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m47s)
01:10:47

[using the categorical codes plus one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m49s)
01:10:49

[replacing missing values with the median](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m51s)
01:10:51

[adding an additional column telling us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m54s)
01:10:54

[which ones were replaced and removing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m56s)
01:10:56

[the dependent variable so that's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h10m59s)
01:10:59

[proc DF does runs very quickly okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m03s)
01:11:03

[you'll see now sale price is no longer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m07s)
01:11:07

[here okay we've now got a whole new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m10s)
01:11:10

[color a whole new variable called Y the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m12s)
01:11:12

[contain sale press you'll see we put a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[couple of extra blah underscore na s at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m17s)
01:11:17

[the end okay and if I look at that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m20s)
01:11:20

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m27s)
01:11:27

[everything is a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m28s)
01:11:28

[okay these boolean z' are treated as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m32s)
01:11:32

[numbers they're just considered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m36s)
01:11:36

[contributed a zero or one that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m37s)
01:11:37

[displayed as false and true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m38s)
01:11:38

[they can see here is at the end of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[month is at the start of a month is at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m44s)
01:11:44

[the end of a quarter it's kind of funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m45s)
01:11:45

[right because we've got things like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m50s)
01:11:50

[model ID which presumably is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m52s)
01:11:52

[like that could be a serial number it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m54s)
01:11:54

[could be like the model identifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m55s)
01:11:55

[that's created by the factory or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m57s)
01:11:57

[something we've got like a data source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h11m59s)
01:11:59

[ID like some of these are numbers but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m00s)
01:12:00

[they're not continuous it turns out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m03s)
01:12:03

[actually random forests work fine with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[those we'll talk about why and how and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m08s)
01:12:08

[lot about that in detail but for now all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m10s)
01:12:10

[you need to know is no problem okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m12s)
01:12:12

[as long as this is all numbers which it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m14s)
01:12:14

[now is we can now go ahead and create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m16s)
01:12:16

[random forest so m dot random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m18s)
01:12:18

[regressor random forests are trivially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m23s)
01:12:23

[paralyse abour so what that means is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m26s)
01:12:26

[that they if you've got more than one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[CPU which everybody will basically on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m31s)
01:12:31

[their computers at home and if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m33s)
01:12:33

[got a t2 dot medium or bigger at AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m36s)
01:12:36

[you've got multiple CPUs trivially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m39s)
01:12:39

[paralyse Abul means that it will split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m41s)
01:12:41

[up the data across your different CPUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m43s)
01:12:43

[and basically linearly scale right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m46s)
01:12:46

[the more CPUs you have pretty much it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m48s)
01:12:48

[will divide the time it takes by that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m51s)
01:12:51

[number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m53s)
01:12:53

[not exactly but roughly so n jobs equals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m53s)
01:12:53

[minus one tells the random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m57s)
01:12:57

[regressor to create a separate job it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h12m59s)
01:12:59

[a separate process basically for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m01s)
01:13:01

[CPU you have so that's pretty much what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m03s)
01:13:03

[you want all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[fit the model using this new data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m08s)
01:13:08

[we created using that Y value we pulled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m11s)
01:13:11

[out and then get the score ok the score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m13s)
01:13:13

[is going to be the r-squared we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m15s)
01:13:15

[define that next week hopefully some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m17s)
01:13:17

[you already know about the r-squared one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m18s)
01:13:18

[is very good zero is very bad so as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m20s)
01:13:20

[can see we've mmediately got a very high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m24s)
01:13:24

[score okay so that looks great but what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m26s)
01:13:26

[we'll talk about next week a lot more is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m32s)
01:13:32

[that it's not quite great because maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m33s)
01:13:33

[we had data that had points that look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m36s)
01:13:36

[like this and we fitted a line that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m39s)
01:13:39

[looks like this when actually we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m41s)
01:13:41

[want normal it looks like that ok the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m44s)
01:13:44

[only way to know whether we've actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m46s)
01:13:46

[done a good job is by having some other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m48s)
01:13:48

[data set that we didn't use to train the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m51s)
01:13:51

[model now we're going to learn about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m53s)
01:13:53

[some ways with random fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m54s)
01:13:54

[we can kind of get away without even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m56s)
01:13:56

[having that other data set but for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[what we're going to do is we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m00s)
01:14:00

[split into twelve thousand rows which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[we're going to put in a separate data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m07s)
01:14:07

[set called the validation set versus the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m08s)
01:14:08

[training sets going to take contain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m11s)
01:14:11

[everything else right and our data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m12s)
01:14:12

[is going to be sorted by date and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m15s)
01:14:15

[that means that the most recent twelve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m19s)
01:14:19

[thousand rows are going to be our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m21s)
01:14:21

[validation set again we'll talk more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m22s)
01:14:22

[about this next week it's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m24s)
01:14:24

[important idea but for now we can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m26s)
01:14:26

[recognize that if we do that and run it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m29s)
01:14:29

[I've created a little thing called print](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m32s)
01:14:32

[score and it's going to print out the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m34s)
01:14:34

[root mean square error between the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m36s)
01:14:36

[predictions and actuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m38s)
01:14:38

[for the training set for the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m39s)
01:14:39

[set that r-squared for the training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m41s)
01:14:41

[and the validation set and you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m44s)
01:14:44

[that actually the r-squared for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m46s)
01:14:46

[training was 0.98 but for the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m48s)
01:14:48

[was 0.89 okay then the RMS see and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m51s)
01:14:51

[remember this is on the logs was point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m55s)
01:14:55

[oh nine for the training set 0.25 for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h14m57s)
01:14:57

[the validation set now if you actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m00s)
01:15:00

[go to cattle and go to the leaderboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m02s)
01:15:02

[okay let's do it right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m05s)
01:15:05

[he's got private and public I click on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m08s)
01:15:08

[public leaderboard and we can go down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[and find out where is point two five so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m15s)
01:15:15

[there are four hundred seventy-five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m17s)
01:15:17

[teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[and generally speaking if you're in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m23s)
01:15:23

[top half of a capital competition you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m26s)
01:15:26

[doing pretty well so a point two-five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m28s)
01:15:28

[here we are point two five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m32s)
01:15:32

[what was it exactly point two five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m34s)
01:15:34

[by two 507 yeah about a hundred and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m37s)
01:15:37

[tenth so we're about in the top 25% so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m43s)
01:15:43

01:15:54

[competition so like random forests are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h15m57s)
01:15:57

[insanely powerful and this totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y#t=01h16m00s)
