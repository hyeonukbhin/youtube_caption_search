[last lesson we looked at what random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m00s)
00:00:00

[forests are and we looked at some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m04s)
00:00:04

[tweaks that we could use to make them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m09s)
00:00:09

[work better so in order to actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m12s)
00:00:12

[practice this we needed to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m19s)
00:00:19

[Jupiter notebook environment running so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m21s)
00:00:21

[we can either install anaconda on our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m24s)
00:00:24

[own computers we can use AWS or we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m28s)
00:00:28

[use cress or comb that has everything up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m32s)
00:00:32

[and running straight away or else paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m34s)
00:00:34

[space comm also works really well so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m37s)
00:00:37

[assuming that you've got all that going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m39s)
00:00:39

[hopefully you had a chance to practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m41s)
00:00:41

[running some random forests this week I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m44s)
00:00:44

[think one of the things to point out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m46s)
00:00:46

[though is that before we did any tweets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m49s)
00:00:49

[of any type of parameters or any tuning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m52s)
00:00:52

[at all the broad defaults already gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m54s)
00:00:54

[us a very good answer for an actual data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h00m58s)
00:00:58

[set that we want to Carol so like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m00s)
00:01:00

[tweets are always you know the main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m03s)
00:01:03

[piece there they're just sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m06s)
00:01:06

[they're totally necessary but quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m08s)
00:01:08

[often you can go a long way without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m13s)
00:01:13

[doing any food store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m15s)
00:01:15

[so today we're going to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m17s)
00:01:17

[something I think may be even more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m20s)
00:01:20

[important than building a predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m23s)
00:01:23

[model that's good at predicting which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m25s)
00:01:25

[to learn how to interpret that model to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m28s)
00:01:28

[find out what it says about your data to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m30s)
00:01:30

[actually understand your data better by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m33s)
00:01:33

[using machine learning and this is kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m37s)
00:01:37

[of contrary to this the common refrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m42s)
00:01:42

[that things like random forests are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[black boxes that hide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m49s)
00:01:49

[meaning from us and you'll see today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m51s)
00:01:51

[that the truth is quite the opposite the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m52s)
00:01:52

[truth is that random forests allow us to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m55s)
00:01:55

[understand our data deeper and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h01m58s)
00:01:58

[quickly than traditional approaches the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m01s)
00:02:01

[other thing we got to learn today is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m04s)
00:02:04

[to look at larger data sets than those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m06s)
00:02:06

[which you can import with just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[defaults and specifically we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m14s)
00:02:14

[look at a data set with over 100 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m16s)
00:02:16

[rows which is the current kaggle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m18s)
00:02:18

[competition for groceries there anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m21s)
00:02:21

[had any questions outside of those two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m26s)
00:02:26

[areas since we're talking about today or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m28s)
00:02:28

[comments Emily yeah it is this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m30s)
00:02:30

[like basic just to make sure I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m37s)
00:02:37

[understanding the concept I'm talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m38s)
00:02:38

[here sorry um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m39s)
00:02:39

[can you just talk a little about like in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m41s)
00:02:41

[general I understand the details more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m44s)
00:02:44

[now random florists but like when do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[know this is an applicable model to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m48s)
00:02:48

[in general be like oh I should try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m51s)
00:02:51

[random forests here because that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m53s)
00:02:53

[part that I'm still like yeah if I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m54s)
00:02:54

[told to I can yeah so the short answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m56s)
00:02:56

[is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h02m58s)
00:02:58

[I can't really think of anything offhand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m02s)
00:03:02

[that it's definitely not going to be at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m05s)
00:03:05

[least somewhat useful for so it's always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m08s)
00:03:08

[worth trying I think really the question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m11s)
00:03:11

[is in what situations should I try other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[things as well and the short answer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[that question is for unstructured data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m21s)
00:03:21

[what I call unstructured data so where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m23s)
00:03:23

[are all the different data points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m25s)
00:03:25

[represent the same kind of thing like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m27s)
00:03:27

[wave form in a sound or speech or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m29s)
00:03:29

[words and piece of text or the pixels in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m32s)
00:03:32

[an image are you almost certainly you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m35s)
00:03:35

[going to want to try deep learning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m37s)
00:03:37

[then outside of those two there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m41s)
00:03:41

[particular type of model we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[look at today called a collaborative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m49s)
00:03:49

[filtering model where which it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m51s)
00:03:51

[happens that the groceries competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m54s)
00:03:54

[is at that kind where neither of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m56s)
00:03:56

[approaches are quite what you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h03m58s)
00:03:58

[without some tweaks to them so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m01s)
00:04:01

[would be the other main one so you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m03s)
00:04:03

[saying neither using deep learning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m05s)
00:04:05

[neither deep learning or random forests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m07s)
00:04:07

[is exactly what you're wanting in to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[kind of do some quests yes yeah if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m11s)
00:04:11

[anybody thinks of other places where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m15s)
00:04:15

[maybe neither of those techniques is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m18s)
00:04:18

[right thing to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m20s)
00:04:20

[yeah mention it on the forums even if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m21s)
00:04:21

[you're not sure you know so we can talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m24s)
00:04:24

[about it because I think this is one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m26s)
00:04:26

[the more interesting questions and to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[some extent it is a case of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m32s)
00:04:32

[practice and experience but I do think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m35s)
00:04:35

[there are you know true main classes no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m38s)
00:04:38

[no so last week we at the point where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m40s)
00:04:40

[had kind of done some of the key steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m55s)
00:04:55

[you know like over CSV reading in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m57s)
00:04:57

[particular which door you know a minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h04m59s)
00:04:59

[or two at the end of that we saved it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m01s)
00:05:01

[a feather format file and just to remind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m03s)
00:05:03

[you that's because this is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m06s)
00:05:06

[almost the same format that it lives in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m09s)
00:05:09

[in RAM so it's like ridiculously fast to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m11s)
00:05:11

[read it and write stuff from from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m13s)
00:05:13

[feather point so what we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m15s)
00:05:15

[today is we're going to look at lesson 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m17s)
00:05:17

[RF interpretation and the first thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m19s)
00:05:19

[we're going to do is read that feather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m23s)
00:05:23

[format file now one thing to mention is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m26s)
00:05:26

[a couple of you pointed out during the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m30s)
00:05:30

[week a really interesting little little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m33s)
00:05:33

[bug or little issue which is in the proc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m38s)
00:05:38

[DF function the proc DF function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m42s)
00:05:42

[remember finds the numeric columns which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m47s)
00:05:47

[have missing values and creates an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m51s)
00:05:51

[additional boolean column as well as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m53s)
00:05:53

[replacing the messing with medians and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[also turns the categorical objects you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m01s)
00:06:01

[know into into the integer codes the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m05s)
00:06:05

[main things it does and coming you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m08s)
00:06:08

[pointed out some key points about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m10s)
00:06:10

[missing value handler the first one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m13s)
00:06:13

[that your test set may have missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m15s)
00:06:15

[values in some columns that weren't in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m21s)
00:06:21

[your training set or vice versa and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m23s)
00:06:23

[that happens you're going to get an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m26s)
00:06:26

[error when you try to do the random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m28s)
00:06:28

[forest because it's going to say you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m29s)
00:06:29

[know if that is missing field appeared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m32s)
00:06:32

[in your training set but not in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m34s)
00:06:34

[test set that ended up in the model it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m36s)
00:06:36

[going to say you can't use that data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m38s)
00:06:38

[with this model because you're missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m42s)
00:06:42

[one of the columns it requires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m44s)
00:06:44

[that's problem number one problem number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m47s)
00:06:47

[two is that the median of the missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m49s)
00:06:49

[belt are the median of the numeric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m52s)
00:06:52

[values in the test set may be different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m54s)
00:06:54

[for the training set and so it may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m57s)
00:06:57

[actually process it into something which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h06m59s)
00:06:59

[has different semantics so I thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m02s)
00:07:02

[that was a really interesting point so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m07s)
00:07:07

[what I did was I changed property air so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m09s)
00:07:09

[it returns a third thing na s and the na](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m13s)
00:07:13

[s thing it returns it doesn't matter in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m18s)
00:07:18

[detail what it is but I'll tell you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m21s)
00:07:21

[say you know that's a dictionary that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m23s)
00:07:23

[where the keys are the names of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m25s)
00:07:25

[columns that had missing values and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m28s)
00:07:28

[values of the dictionary are the medians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m31s)
00:07:31

[and so then optionally you can pass n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m33s)
00:07:33

[A's as an additional argument to prop D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m37s)
00:07:37

[F and it will make sure that it adds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m41s)
00:07:41

[those specific columns and it uses those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m44s)
00:07:44

[specific medians okay so it kind of it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m47s)
00:07:47

[it's giving you the ability to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[process this test set in exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m53s)
00:07:53

[same way as we process this training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m55s)
00:07:55

[center can you pass that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h07m58s)
00:07:58

[is a did it features we just yeah so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m04s)
00:08:04

[just did that like it's just a good pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[yeah in fact that's a good point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m10s)
00:08:10

[before you start doing work any day I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m11s)
00:08:11

[would start doing it get pull and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m16s)
00:08:16

[something's not working today that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m19s)
00:08:19

[was working yesterday check the forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[where they'll be an explanation of why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m22s)
00:08:22

[you know this this library in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m24s)
00:08:24

[is moving fast but pretty much all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m28s)
00:08:28

[libraries that we use including pi torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m30s)
00:08:30

[and particular move fast and so one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m32s)
00:08:32

[the things to do if you're watching this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m35s)
00:08:35

[on through the MOOC is to make sure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m37s)
00:08:37

[you go to course doc bastard AI and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m40s)
00:08:40

[check the links there because they'll be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m42s)
00:08:42

[links saying oh these are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m44s)
00:08:44

[differences from the course so they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m46s)
00:08:46

[kind of kept up to date so that you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m48s)
00:08:48

[never gonna because I can't edit what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[I'm saying yeah but yeah do it get Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m53s)
00:08:53

[before you start each day so I haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h08m57s)
00:08:57

[actually updated all of the notebooks to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m03s)
00:09:03

[add the extra return value i will over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m07s)
00:09:07

[the next couple of days but if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[using them you'll just need to put next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m12s)
00:09:12

[to a comma and it is yeah otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m13s)
00:09:13

[we're going to error them its return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m15s)
00:09:15

[through things and you only have room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m17s)
00:09:17

[for two things okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m19s)
00:09:19

[what I want to do I think what I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m25s)
00:09:25

[do before I talk about interpretation is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[to show you what the exact same process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m29s)
00:09:29

[looks like when you're working with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m33s)
00:09:33

[really large data set so and you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m36s)
00:09:36

[it's kind of almost the same thing but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m43s)
00:09:43

[there's going to be a few cases where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[can't use the defaults because the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m46s)
00:09:46

[default kind of flag just run a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m48s)
00:09:48

[bit too slowly right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[so specifically I'm going to look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m53s)
00:09:53

[travel groceries competition specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h09m58s)
00:09:58

[lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m03s)
00:10:03

[what's a call here it is compress your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m05s)
00:10:05

[favorite grocery sales forecasting so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m09s)
00:10:09

[this competition Oh who's who who was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m12s)
00:10:12

[entering this competition okay lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m18s)
00:10:18

[you who would like to have a go at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m21s)
00:10:21

[explaining what this competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m25s)
00:10:25

[involves what what the data is when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m27s)
00:10:27

[family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m29s)
00:10:29

[okay trying to predict the items on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m33s)
00:10:33

[shelf depending on lots of factors like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m37s)
00:10:37

[oil prices let me say predicting the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m40s)
00:10:40

[items on the show what do you mean what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m42s)
00:10:42

[are you actually predicting how much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m43s)
00:10:43

[change to help me stop to maximize their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m47s)
00:10:47

[I guess it's not quite what we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m48s)
00:10:48

[predicting but not trying to fix that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m51s)
00:10:51

[yeah and then there's a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m52s)
00:10:52

[different data sets that you can use to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m55s)
00:10:55

[do that there's oil prices there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m56s)
00:10:56

[stores there's locations and each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h10m58s)
00:10:58

[those can be used to try to predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m01s)
00:11:01

[okay does anybody want to have a go at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m03s)
00:11:03

[expanding on that all right so we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m05s)
00:11:05

[bunch of information on different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m15s)
00:11:15

[products so we have so forth all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m17s)
00:11:17

[so far every stool for every item for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m23s)
00:11:23

[every day we have a lot of related](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m27s)
00:11:27

[information available like the location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m30s)
00:11:30

[where the school was located the class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m35s)
00:11:35

[of the product and units soared and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m36s)
00:11:36

[based on this we are supposed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m41s)
00:11:41

[forecast in a much shorter timeframe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m43s)
00:11:43

[compared to the training data for every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m46s)
00:11:46

[item number how much we think it's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m48s)
00:11:48

[to sell so only the units and nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m50s)
00:11:50

[else so um so your ability to explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h11m53s)
00:11:53

[the problem you're working on is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m05s)
00:12:05

[really important okay so if you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m08s)
00:12:08

[currently feel confident of your ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m11s)
00:12:11

[to do that practice right with someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[who is not in this competition tell them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m16s)
00:12:16

[all about it so in this case but or in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m19s)
00:12:19

[any case really the key things to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m25s)
00:12:25

[understand a machine learning problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m26s)
00:12:26

[would be to say what are the independent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m28s)
00:12:28

[variables and what is the dependent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m30s)
00:12:30

[variable so the dependent variable is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[the theme that you're trying to predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m33s)
00:12:33

[the thing you're trying to predict is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m34s)
00:12:34

[how many units of each kind of product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m37s)
00:12:37

[were sold in each store on each day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m41s)
00:12:41

[during the two-week period so that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m45s)
00:12:45

[thing that you're trying to predict and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m48s)
00:12:48

[the information you have to predict it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m49s)
00:12:49

[is how many units of each product at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m52s)
00:12:52

[each store on each day were sold in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h12m56s)
00:12:56

[last few years and for each store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m00s)
00:13:00

[it's a metadata about it like where is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m04s)
00:13:04

[it located and what classes or is it for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m06s)
00:13:06

[each type of product you have some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m09s)
00:13:09

[metadata about it such as what category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m13s)
00:13:13

[of product is it and so forth for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[date we have some metadata about it such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m17s)
00:13:17

[as what was the oil price on that date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[so this is what we would call a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m23s)
00:13:23

[relational data set so a relational data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m25s)
00:13:25

[set is one where we have a number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m28s)
00:13:28

[different pieces information that we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m30s)
00:13:30

[join together specifically this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m32s)
00:13:32

[relational database data set is what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m36s)
00:13:36

[would refer to as a star schema a star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m39s)
00:13:39

[schema is a kind of data warehousing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m42s)
00:13:42

[schema where we basically say there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m44s)
00:13:44

[some central transactions table then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m46s)
00:13:46

[this place the central transactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m50s)
00:13:50

[table we go in the data section here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m51s)
00:13:51

[train dot CSV and it contains the event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h13m55s)
00:13:55

[number of units that were sold by date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m01s)
00:14:01

[by store ID by item ID okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m04s)
00:14:04

[the central transaction state where it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m09s)
00:14:09

[more very simple and then from that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m11s)
00:14:11

[can join various bits of metadata and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m13s)
00:14:13

[it's called a standard schema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m17s)
00:14:17

[because you can kind of imagine the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m18s)
00:14:18

[transactions take on the middle and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m20s)
00:14:20

[all these different metadata tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m22s)
00:14:22

[join onto it giving you more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m24s)
00:14:24

[about the date the item ID and the store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m26s)

[already okay sometimes you'll also see a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m31s)

[snowflake schema which means they might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m35s)
00:14:35

[then be additional information joined on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m38s)
00:14:38

[to maybe the the items table that tells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[you about different item categories and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m43s)
00:14:43

[store to the store table coming about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m46s)
00:14:46

[the stage that the stores in and so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m49s)
00:14:49

[wholesomely okay so that's the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m51s)
00:14:51

[information about this problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h14m58s)
00:14:58

[the independent variables the dependent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m01s)
00:15:01

[variable and you probably also wanting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[about like things like the time frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[okay now we start in exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m09s)
00:15:09

[way as we did before loading in exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[the same spot setting the path but when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m18s)
00:15:18

[we go to read CSV if you say limit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m21s)
00:15:21

[memory equals false right then you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m25s)
00:15:25

[basically saying use as much memory as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m29s)
00:15:29

[you like to figure out what kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m30s)
00:15:30

[data is here it's going to run out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m33s)
00:15:33

[memory pretty much regardless of how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m35s)
00:15:35

[much memory you have so what we do in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m37s)
00:15:37

[order to limit the amount of space that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m41s)
00:15:41

[it takes up and read it in is we create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m44s)
00:15:44

[a dictionary for each column name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m46s)
00:15:46

[through the data type of that column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m48s)
00:15:48

[right and so for you to create this it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m51s)
00:15:51

[basically up to you to you know run less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m54s)
00:15:54

[or head or whatever on the data set to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m57s)
00:15:57

[see what the types are and to figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h15m59s)
00:15:59

[that out and pass them in so then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m01s)
00:16:01

[can just pass in D type equals with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m04s)
00:16:04

[dictionary and so check this out right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m07s)
00:16:07

[we can read in the whole CSV file in one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m11s)
00:16:11

[minute and 48 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m17s)
00:16:17

[and there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m21s)
00:16:21

[one hundred and twenty five point five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m24s)
00:16:24

[million roads so like whence people say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[like pythons slow now pythons not slow I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m32s)
00:16:32

[think can be slow if you don't use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m37s)
00:16:37

[right but we can actually cause a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m39s)
00:16:39

[hundred and twenty-five million CSV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m41s)

[records in less than two minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m43s)
00:16:43

[my language had on for just a moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m50s)
00:16:50

[actually if it's fast almost certainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m53s)
00:16:53

[it's going to see yeah so Python is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m56s)
00:16:56

[wrapper around a bunch of C code usually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h16m59s)
00:16:59

[yeah so yeah so Python itself isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m00s)
00:17:00

[actually very fast yeah so that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m05s)
00:17:05

[Terrence paw who writes things for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m13s)

[living so and he's right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m17s)
00:17:17

[- itself is not fast but almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m20s)
00:17:20

[everything we want to do in Python and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m23s)
00:17:23

[data science has been written for us in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m25s)
00:17:25

[C or actually more often in scythe on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m27s)
00:17:27

[which is a - like language which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m29s)
00:17:29

[compiles to C and so most of the stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m32s)
00:17:32

[we run in Python is actually running not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m34s)
00:17:34

[just the C code but actually in pandas a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m38s)
00:17:38

[lot of it's written in like assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m40s)
00:17:40

[language it's heavily optimized behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m41s)
00:17:41

[the scenes a lot of that is going back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m44s)
00:17:44

[to actually calling for train back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m45s)
00:17:45

[libraries for linear algebra so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m48s)
00:17:48

[layers one layer of speeds that actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m51s)
00:17:51

[allow us to spend less than two minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m54s)
00:17:54

[reading that much data yeah if we wrote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h17m57s)
00:17:57

[our own CSV reader in pure Python it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m00s)
00:18:00

[would take it takes thousands of times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m05s)
00:18:05

[at least thousands of times longer than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m07s)
00:18:07

[the optimized versions yeah so for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m09s)
00:18:09

[what we care about is the speed we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m14s)
00:18:14

[get in practice and so this is pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m16s)
00:18:16

[cool we as well as telling it what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m18s)
00:18:18

[different data types were we also have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m22s)
00:18:22

[to tell it as before which things do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m24s)
00:18:24

[want to pass as as dense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m26s)
00:18:26

[that's - I've noticed searching this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[dictionary of specifying 60 1433 ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m34s)
00:18:34

[date I was wondering in practice is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m37s)
00:18:37

[like faster if you all specify them to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m42s)
00:18:42

[endure slower or like any performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m45s)
00:18:45

[consideration so the key performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m48s)
00:18:48

[consideration here was to use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m49s)
00:18:49

[smallest number of bits that I could to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m51s)
00:18:51

[fully represent the column so if I had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m55s)
00:18:55

[used in 8 for item number there are more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h18m57s)
00:18:57

[than 255 biomass and but the I mean who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m00s)
00:19:00

[was specifically the maximum item number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m02s)
00:19:02

[is bigger than 255 so on the other hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m04s)
00:19:04

[if I'd used in 64 the score number it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m07s)
00:19:07

[using more it's necessary given that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m11s)
00:19:11

[whole purpose here was to avoid running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m14s)
00:19:14

[out of RAM we don't want to be using up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m15s)
00:19:15

[eight times more memory than necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m18s)
00:19:18

[so the key thing was really about memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m20s)
00:19:20

[and in fact when you're working with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m23s)
00:19:23

[large data sets very often you'll find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m25s)
00:19:25

[the slope piece is the actually reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m28s)
00:19:28

[and writing program not the actual CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m30s)
00:19:30

[operations so very often that's the key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[performance consideration also however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m36s)
00:19:36

[as a rule of thumb smaller data types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m40s)
00:19:40

[often will run faster and particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m44s)
00:19:44

[if you can use Cindy so there's a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m47s)
00:19:47

[instruction multiple data a vectorized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m50s)
00:19:50

[code it can pack more more numbers into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m51s)
00:19:51

[a single vector to run at once think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h19m56s)
00:19:56

[that was all definitely simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m03s)
00:20:03

[exactly right but once you do this the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m06s)
00:20:06

[shuffle thing beforehand I need anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m12s)
00:20:12

[they made assigned a random substitution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m14s)
00:20:14

[yeah so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m18s)
00:20:18

[so although here I've read in the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m22s)
00:20:22

[thing when I start I never start by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m25s)
00:20:25

[reading in the whole thing so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m29s)
00:20:29

[search the forum fish fish off shuf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m34s)
00:20:34

[you'll find some tips about how to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m38s)
00:20:38

[this UNIX command to get a random sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m42s)
00:20:42

[of data at the command prompt and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m44s)
00:20:44

[you can just read that and the nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m48s)
00:20:48

[thing is that that way like that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[good way for example to find out what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m51s)
00:20:51

[data types to use it is to read in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m53s)
00:20:53

[random sample and let pandas figure it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m56s)
00:20:56

[out for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h20m57s)
00:20:57

[yeah and in general I do as much work as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m05s)
00:21:05

[possible on a sample until I feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m09s)
00:21:09

[confident that I understand the sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m11s)
00:21:11

[before I move on so yeah having said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m13s)
00:21:13

[that what we're about to learn is some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m17s)
00:21:17

[techniques for running models on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m19s)
00:21:19

[full data set that I'm actually going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m21s)
00:21:21

[work on arbitrarily large data sets but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m22s)
00:21:22

[also I specifically wanted to talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m24s)
00:21:24

[how to really invite analysis one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m26s)
00:21:26

[to mention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m29s)
00:21:29

[unpromoted object objects are like like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m30s)
00:21:30

[saying create a general-purpose Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m33s)
00:21:33

[data type which is slow and memory heavy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m36s)
00:21:36

[and the reason for that is that this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m38s)
00:21:38

[a boolean which also has missing values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m40s)
00:21:40

[and so we need to deal with this before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m43s)
00:21:43

[we can turn it into a boolean so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m45s)
00:21:45

[see after that I then go ahead and I say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m47s)
00:21:47

[fill in the missing values with false](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m49s)
00:21:49

[now you wouldn't just do this without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m53s)
00:21:53

[doing some checking ahead of time but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m54s)
00:21:54

[some exploratory data analysis shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m56s)
00:21:56

[that it seems that this is probably an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h21m59s)
00:21:59

[appropriate thing to do it seems that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m00s)
00:22:00

[missing doesn't mean most it objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m02s)
00:22:02

[generally reading the string so replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m06s)
00:22:06

[for Strings true and false with actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m08s)
00:22:08

[volumes and then finally convert it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m10s)
00:22:10

[an actual boolean flag so at this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[when I save this this file now over 123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m15s)
00:22:15

[million records takes up something under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m20s)
00:22:20

[two and a half gigabytes of memory so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m23s)
00:22:23

[like that you can do like run you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m26s)
00:22:26

[look at pretty large data sets even on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m28s)
00:22:28

[pretty small computers which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m30s)
00:22:30

[interests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m32s)
00:22:32

[so at that point now that it's in a nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m32s)
00:22:32

[fast four-minute look how fast it is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m35s)
00:22:35

[can save it to feather format in under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m37s)
00:22:37

[five seconds okay so that's nice and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m39s)
00:22:39

[then because pandas is generally pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m43s)
00:22:43

[fast you can do stuff like summarize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m45s)
00:22:45

[every column of all 125 million records](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m49s)
00:22:49

[in 20 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m53s)
00:22:53

[okay so the first thing I looked at here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m55s)
00:22:55

[actually is the dates right generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h22m58s)
00:22:58

[speaking dates are just going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m01s)
00:23:01

[really important and one of the stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m02s)
00:23:02

[you do particularly because any model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m04s)
00:23:04

[that you put in in in practice you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m07s)
00:23:07

[going to be putting it in at some note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m10s)
00:23:10

[that is later than the date that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m11s)
00:23:11

[trained it by definition right and so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m13s)
00:23:13

[anything in the world changes you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m16s)
00:23:16

[to know how your predictive accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m18s)
00:23:18

[changes as well and so what you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m20s)
00:23:20

[on cable and what you should always do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m22s)
00:23:22

[in your own projects is make sure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m24s)
00:23:24

[your plates don't overlap so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m26s)
00:23:26

[case the dates that we have in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m28s)
00:23:28

[training set go from 2013 to mid August](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m30s)
00:23:30

[2017 okay there's our first and last and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m34s)
00:23:34

[then in our test set they go from one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m39s)
00:23:39

[day later right August the 16th until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m43s)
00:23:43

[the end of the month so this is a key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m47s)
00:23:47

[thing that like you can't really do any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m49s)
00:23:49

[useful machine learning until you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m52s)
00:23:52

[understand this basic piece here which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m54s)
00:23:54

[is you've got four years of data and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h23m56s)
00:23:56

[you're trying to predict the next two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m01s)
00:24:01

[weeks okay so that's just a fundamental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m05s)
00:24:05

[thing that you're going to need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m07s)
00:24:07

[understand before you can go and do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m09s)
00:24:09

[good job at this and so as soon as I see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m10s)
00:24:10

[that what does that say to you if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m13s)
00:24:13

[want it to now use a smaller data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m16s)
00:24:16

[should you use a random sample or is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m19s)
00:24:19

[there something better you do probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m22s)
00:24:22

[from the bottom more recent yeah okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m26s)
00:24:26

[the most recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m28s)
00:24:28

[right and and if you ever have trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[answering questions like this just try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m30s)
00:24:30

[to make it as physical as possible so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m33s)
00:24:33

[it's like okay I'm going to go to a shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m34s)
00:24:34

[next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m39s)
00:24:39

[and I am I've got a $5 bet with my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m41s)
00:24:41

[brother as to whether I can guess how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m43s)
00:24:43

[many cans of coke are going to be on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m46s)
00:24:46

[shelf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m48s)
00:24:48

[all right well probably the best way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m49s)
00:24:49

[do that would be to go to the shop same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[day of the previous week and see how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m54s)
00:24:54

[many cans of coke are on the shelf and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m56s)
00:24:56

[guess it's going to be the same you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m58s)
00:24:58

[wouldn't go and look at family were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h24m59s)
00:24:59

[there four years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[but couldn't four years ago that same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m06s)
00:25:06

[time frame of the year be important I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m09s)
00:25:09

[mean like for example how much coke they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m11s)
00:25:11

[have in the shop at Christmas time is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m13s)
00:25:13

[gonna be way more than so exactly so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m14s)
00:25:14

[it's not that there's no useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m16s)
00:25:16

[information from four years ago and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m18s)
00:25:18

[we don't want to entirely throw it away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m22s)
00:25:22

[but as a as a first step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m24s)
00:25:24

[like what was this what's the simplest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m26s)
00:25:26

[possible thing it's kind of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m28s)
00:25:28

[submitting the means I wouldn't submit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m30s)
00:25:30

[the mean of 2012 sales I would want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m32s)
00:25:32

[probably submit the mean of last month's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m36s)
00:25:36

[cents so yeah we just want to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[about like how might we want to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m43s)
00:25:43

[create some initial easy models and how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m46s)
00:25:46

[and later on like we might want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m49s)
00:25:49

[weight it so for example we might want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[to wait for recent dates more highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m52s)
00:25:52

[they're probably more relevant but we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m54s)
00:25:54

[should do a whole bunch of exploratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m57s)
00:25:57

[data analysis to check that so here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h25m58s)
00:25:58

[what the bottom of that data set looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m01s)
00:26:01

[like okay and you can see literally it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m03s)
00:26:03

[got a date a store number and item](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m07s)
00:26:07

[number and give it sales and tells you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m10s)
00:26:10

[whether or not that particular item was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m13s)
00:26:13

[on sale at that particular store on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[particular day and then there's some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m18s)
00:26:18

[Terry ID right so that's it so now that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m20s)
00:26:20

[we have read that in we can do stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m27s)
00:26:27

[like this is interesting again we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m29s)
00:26:29

[to take the log of the sales and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m33s)
00:26:33

[the same reason as we looked at last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m37s)
00:26:37

[week right because we're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m38s)
00:26:38

[predict something that kind of varies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m40s)
00:26:40

[according to ratios they told us in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m41s)
00:26:41

[in this competition that the root mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m44s)
00:26:44

[squared log error is something they care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m47s)
00:26:47

[about so we take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m49s)
00:26:49

[they mentioned also if you check the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m51s)
00:26:51

[competition details which should always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m53s)
00:26:53

[should read carefully the definition of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m55s)
00:26:55

[any project you do it's they say that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m57s)
00:26:57

[there are some negative sales that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h26m59s)
00:26:59

[represent returns and they tell us that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m01s)
00:27:01

[we should consider them to be zero for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m04s)
00:27:04

[the purpose of this competition so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m06s)
00:27:06

[clip the sales so that they fall between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m08s)
00:27:08

[zero and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m12s)
00:27:12

[no particular maximum it's a clip just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m14s)
00:27:14

[means cuddle after that point truncate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m17s)
00:27:17

[it and then take the log of that plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m20s)
00:27:20

[one why do I do plus one because again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m23s)
00:27:23

[if you check the details of the cable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m26s)
00:27:26

[competition that's what they tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m27s)
00:27:27

[they're going to use is they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m29s)
00:27:29

[actually just taking the root mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m30s)
00:27:30

[squared log error but the root mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m31s)
00:27:31

[squared log plus one there okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m33s)
00:27:33

[because log of zero doesn't make sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m36s)
00:27:36

[we can add the date part as usual and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m40s)
00:27:40

[you know again it's taking a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m43s)
00:27:43

[minutes right so I would run through all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m46s)
00:27:46

[this on a sample first so everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m48s)
00:27:48

[takes ten seconds to make sure it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m50s)
00:27:50

[just to check everything that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m52s)
00:27:52

[reasonable before I go back so I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m53s)
00:27:53

[want to wait two minutes or something I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m55s)
00:27:55

[don't know what's going to work but as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m57s)
00:27:57

[you can see all this all these lines of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h27m59s)

[code are identical to what we saw for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m01s)
00:28:01

[the bulldozers competition in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m03s)
00:28:03

[and all I'm bringing in is a training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m07s)
00:28:07

[set I didn't need to run trained cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m09s)
00:28:09

[because all of my data types are already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[numeric okay if they weren't I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[need to call trained cast and then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[would need to call the ply cats to apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m20s)
00:28:20

[the same categorical codes that I down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[from the training set to the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m24s)
00:28:24

[set I call prop D F as before to check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m27s)
00:28:27

[the missing values and so forth so all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m34s)
00:28:34

[of those lines of code are identical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m37s)
00:28:37

[these lines of code again are identical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m39s)
00:28:39

[because root mean square errors store we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m42s)
00:28:42

[care about and then I've got two changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m44s)
00:28:44

[the first is sent our F samples which we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m49s)
00:28:49

[learnt about last week so we've got 120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m53s)
00:28:53

[something million records we probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m56s)
00:28:56

[don't want to create a tree from our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h28m59s)
00:28:59

[hundred twenty million something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m01s)
00:29:01

[reckless I don't even know how long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m03s)
00:29:03

[that's going to take I haven't been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m05s)
00:29:05

[I haven't at the time and patience for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m06s)
00:29:06

[wagon see so you know you can start with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[ten thousand or a hundred thousand you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m12s)
00:29:12

[know maybe runs in a few seconds make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m15s)
00:29:15

[sure it works and you can kind of figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m17s)
00:29:17

[out how much you can run and so I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m18s)
00:29:18

[getting it to a million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m20s)
00:29:20

[it runs in under a minute alright and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m23s)
00:29:23

[the point here is there's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[relationship between the size of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[data set and how long it takes to build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m30s)
00:29:30

[the random forests their relationship is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m32s)
00:29:32

[between the number of estimators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m34s)
00:29:34

[multiplied by the sample size okay I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m36s)
00:29:36

[just curious what Angela's cousin has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m43s)
00:29:43

[always been negative one yeah so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[number of jobs is the number of cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m48s)
00:29:48

[thursdaya news and I was running this on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m50s)
00:29:50

[a computer that has about 60 cause and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m54s)
00:29:54

[just found if you try to use all of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m57s)
00:29:57

[had spent so much time spending I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h29m59s)
00:29:59

[drops it was doing slower so if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m00s)
00:30:00

[got like lots and lots of cores on your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m02s)
00:30:02

[computer sometimes you want less than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m04s)
00:30:04

[negative one means use every single core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m06s)
00:30:06

[and there's one more change I made which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[is that I converted the data frame into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[an array of floats and then I fit it on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[that why did I do that because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m20s)
00:30:20

[internally inside the random forest code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m24s)
00:30:24

[they do that anyway right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m26s)
00:30:26

[and so given that I want to run a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m28s)
00:30:28

[different random forests with a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m31s)
00:30:31

[different hyper crepitus by doing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m32s)
00:30:32

[once myself I save that minute 37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m35s)
00:30:35

[seconds right so if you run a line of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m38s)
00:30:38

[code at a text like quite a long time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m44s)
00:30:44

[the first time I ran this random first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m48s)
00:30:48

[regressor a kind of took two or three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m50s)
00:30:50

[minutes and I thought I don't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m52s)
00:30:52

[want to wait to a few minutes you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m53s)
00:30:53

[always add in front of the line of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m55s)
00:30:55

[hey run a percent P right and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h30m58s)
00:30:58

[percent p run does is it runs something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m02s)
00:31:02

[called a profile and what a profiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m04s)
00:31:04

[does is it'll tell you which lines of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m07s)
00:31:07

[code behind the teens took the most time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m10s)
00:31:10

[right and in this case I noticed that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m12s)
00:31:12

[there was a line of code inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m15s)
00:31:15

[scikit-learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m16s)
00:31:16

[that was this line of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m17s)
00:31:17

[and it was taking all the time the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m19s)
00:31:19

[day and so I thought oh I'll do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m21s)
00:31:21

[first and then I'll pass you the result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m23s)
00:31:23

[and I won't do it again okay so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m25s)
00:31:25

[thing of looking to see which things is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m28s)
00:31:28

[taking up the time is called profiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m30s)
00:31:30

[and in software engineering is one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m32s)
00:31:32

[the most important tools you have data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m35s)
00:31:35

[scientists really under appreciate this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m37s)
00:31:37

[tool that you'll find like amongst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m40s)
00:31:40

[conversations on issues or on Twitter or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m43s)
00:31:43

[whatever I'm at the top data scientists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m45s)
00:31:45

[they're sharing and talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m48s)
00:31:48

[profilers all the time and that's how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m50s)
00:31:50

[easy it is to get a profile so for fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m52s)
00:31:52

[you know try running peer on from time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m56s)
00:31:56

[to time on stuff that's taking 10 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h31m59s)
00:31:59

[seconds and see if you can learn to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m01s)
00:32:01

[interpret and use profile outputs you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m03s)
00:32:03

[know even though in this case I didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m07s)
00:32:07

[write this scikit-learn plus I was still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m09s)
00:32:09

[able to use the profile to figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m13s)
00:32:13

[how to make it run over twice as fast by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m15s)
00:32:15

[avoiding recalculating this each time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m19s)
00:32:19

[in this case I build my regressor I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m23s)
00:32:23

[decided to use 20 estimators something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m25s)
00:32:25

[else that I noticed in the profiler is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m27s)
00:32:27

[that I can't use our base for when I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[is set our f samples because if I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[it's going to use the other 124 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m34s)
00:32:34

[rows to calculate the oeob score which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m38s)
00:32:38

[is like again it's still going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m42s)
00:32:42

[forever so I may as well have a proper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m44s)
00:32:44

[validation set anyway besides which I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m46s)
00:32:46

[want the validation set that's the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m48s)
00:32:48

[recent dates rather than is random so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m50s)
00:32:50

[you use set RF samples on a large data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m53s)
00:32:53

[set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m56s)
00:32:56

[don't put the low B score parameter in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h32m57s)
00:32:57

[because it takes forever so that got me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m00s)
00:33:00

[a point seven six validation root mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m05s)
00:33:05

[squared log error and then I tried like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m09s)
00:33:09

[fiddling around a different min samples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m12s)
00:33:12

[so if I decrease the min sample say from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m14s)
00:33:14

[100 to 10 it took a little bit more time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m16s)
00:33:16

[to run as we'd expect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m19s)
00:33:19

[and the arrow went down from 76 to 71 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m21s)
00:33:21

[that looks pretty good so I kept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m27s)
00:33:27

[decreasing it down to 3 and that brought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m29s)
00:33:29

[this arrow down to 0.7 oh and when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m31s)
00:33:31

[decrease it down to 1 we didn't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m34s)
00:33:34

[know so I kind of had like a reasonable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m36s)
00:33:36

[random forest yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[when I say reasonable though it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m42s)
00:33:42

[reasonable in the sense that it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m46s)
00:33:46

[does not give a good result on the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m48s)
00:33:48

[to one and so this is a very interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m51s)
00:33:51

[question about why is that and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m55s)
00:33:55

[reason is really coming back to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m57s)
00:33:57

[Savannah's question earlier like where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h33m59s)
00:33:59

[my random forests not work as well let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m01s)
00:34:01

[go back and look at the data okay here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m05s)
00:34:05

[the entire data set that we won at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m08s)
00:34:08

[whole data set here's all the columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m10s)
00:34:10

[that we used so the columns that we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m11s)
00:34:11

[to predict with are they the date the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[store number the item number and weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m18s)
00:34:18

[is unpredictable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m21s)
00:34:21

[day of week day of month day of year is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m26s)
00:34:26

[corner start etc etc so if you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m29s)
00:34:29

[about it most of the insight you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m36s)
00:34:36

[around like how much of something you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m39s)
00:34:39

00:34:42

[be very wrapped up in the details about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m45s)

[like what where is that store what kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m47s)

[of things do they tend to sell at that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m50s)

[fresh bread they might not sell much of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h34m58s)

[it on Sundays because on Sundays you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m01s)

[know and fresh bread doesn't get made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m03s)
00:35:03

[we're obvious it's gasoline maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m05s)
00:35:05

[they're gonna sell a lot of gasoline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m08s)

[its ability to really understand what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m36s)
00:35:36

[going on is somewhat limited so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m40s)
00:35:40

[probably going to need to use the entire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m42s)
00:35:42

[four years of data to even get some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[useful insights but then the students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m46s)

[beside using the whole four years of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m49s)
00:35:49

[data and one of the data we're using is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m50s)
00:35:50

[really old so interestingly there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m52s)
00:35:52

[cable kernel that points out that what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[you could do is just take the last two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m01s)
00:36:01

[weeks and take the average sales the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m03s)
00:36:03

[average sales by date by store number by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m07s)
00:36:07

[item number and just submit that and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m11s)
00:36:11

[you just submit that you come about 30th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m15s)
00:36:15

[all right so for those of you in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m20s)
00:36:20

[groceries kind of Terrace as I come into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m23s)
00:36:23

[a question I think this may have tripped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m25s)
00:36:25

[me up actually I think you said dates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m32s)
00:36:32

[store item I think it's actually store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m33s)
00:36:33

[item sales and then you mean across date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m35s)
00:36:35

[oh yeah you're right it's a store item](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m38s)
00:36:38

[at one promotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m40s)
00:36:40

[I know promotion is you know if you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m42s)
00:36:42

[it if you do it like date as well you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m46s)
00:36:46

[end up so these each row represents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m48s)
00:36:48

[basically like a cross tabulation of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m52s)
00:36:52

[of the sales on that date in that store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m54s)
00:36:54

[for the item so if you put date in there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m56s)
00:36:56

[as well there's only going to be one or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h36m58s)
00:36:58

[two items being averaged in each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m00s)
00:37:00

[those cells which is you know too much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m03s)
00:37:03

[variation basically two spots it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m06s)
00:37:06

[give you a terrible result but it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m09s)
00:37:09

[not xxx so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m11s)
00:37:11

[so your job if you are looking at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m17s)
00:37:17

[competition and we'll talk about this in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m19s)
00:37:19

[the in the next class is how do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m20s)
00:37:20

[start with that model and make it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m24s)
00:37:24

[little bit better all right because if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m29s)
00:37:29

[you can then by the time we made up next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m32s)
00:37:32

[hopefully you'll be above the top 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m35s)
00:37:35

[because you know CAG will be in Kaggle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m38s)
00:37:38

[lots of people have now taken this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m41s)
00:37:41

[kernel and submitted it and they all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m42s)
00:37:42

[have about the same score and the scores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m44s)
00:37:44

[are ordered not just by score but by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m46s)
00:37:46

[date submitted so if you now submit this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m48s)
00:37:48

[kernel you're not going to be 30th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m51s)
00:37:51

[because you're way down the list when it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[was submitted all right but if you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m56s)
00:37:56

[retire a bit better you're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h37m58s)
00:37:58

[better than all of those people so try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m00s)
00:38:00

[and think of how can you make this a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m02s)
00:38:02

[tiny bit better I could you try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m03s)
00:38:03

[capture seasonality and trend effects by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m11s)
00:38:11

[creating new columns like these are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m13s)
00:38:13

[average sales in the month of August](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m15s)
00:38:15

[these are the average sales for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m17s)
00:38:17

[year yeah I think that's a great idea so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m18s)
00:38:18

[the thing for you to think about is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[to do that right and so like see if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m24s)
00:38:24

[can see if you can make it work because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m27s)
00:38:27

[there are details to get right which I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m29s)
00:38:29

[know Terrance has been working on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m31s)
00:38:31

[for the last week and he's got almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m33s)
00:38:33

[crazy like the details Prez here the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m34s)
00:38:34

[details are are difficult they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m38s)
00:38:38

[difficult like intellectually difficult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m42s)
00:38:42

[they're kind of difficult in the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m45s)
00:38:45

[that makes you like when I head back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m47s)
00:38:47

[your desk at to any air and like this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m48s)
00:38:48

[something to mention in general is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m51s)
00:38:51

[coding you do the machine learning is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m55s)
00:38:55

[like it's incredibly frustrating and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h38m58s)
00:38:58

[incredibly difficult not difficult like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m03s)
00:39:03

[technically but difficult like there if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m06s)
00:39:06

[you get a detail wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m08s)
00:39:08

[much of the time it's not going to give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m11s)
00:39:11

[you an exception it will just silently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m13s)
00:39:13

[be slightly less good than it otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m15s)
00:39:15

[would have been right and if your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m17s)
00:39:17

[peril at least you know okay well I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m19s)
00:39:19

[not doing as well as other people won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m22s)
00:39:22

[haggle right but if you're not on cattle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m23s)
00:39:23

[you just don't know like you don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m25s)
00:39:25

[if your company's model is like half as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m28s)
00:39:28

[good as it could be because you made a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m30s)
00:39:30

[little mistake right so that's why one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m32s)
00:39:32

[of the reasons why practicing on tackle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m35s)
00:39:35

[now is great right because you're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m37s)
00:39:37

[to get practice in finding all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m39s)
00:39:39

[ways in which you can infuriatingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m41s)
00:39:41

[screw things up and you'll be amazed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m43s)
00:39:43

[like for me there's extraordinary array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m46s)
00:39:46

[array of them but as you get to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m48s)
00:39:48

[what they are you'll start to know how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m51s)
00:39:51

[to check for them as you go right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m53s)
00:39:53

[the only way like you should assume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m56s)
00:39:56

[every button you press you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h39m58s)
00:39:58

[press the wrong button right and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m00s)
00:40:00

[fine as long as you have a way to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m02s)
00:40:02

[out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m04s)
00:40:04

[okay so we'll talk about that more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m05s)
00:40:05

[during the course but unfortunately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m11s)
00:40:11

[there isn't like a set of specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m13s)
00:40:13

[things I can tell you to always do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m16s)
00:40:16

[just always have to think like okay what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m18s)
00:40:18

[do I know about the results of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m21s)
00:40:21

[thing I'm about to do I'll give you a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m24s)
00:40:24

[really simple example a really simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m25s)
00:40:25

[example if you've actually created that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m28s)
00:40:28

[that basic entry entry where you do take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m30s)
00:40:30

[the mean by date by store number by own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[promotion right and you've like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m35s)
00:40:35

[submitted it and you've got a reasonable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[score and then you think you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m38s)
00:40:38

[something that's a little bit better and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m41s)
00:40:41

[you do predictions for that how about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m42s)
00:40:42

[you don't create a scatter plot showing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[the predictions of your average model on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m48s)

[one axis versus the predictions of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m52s)

[new model on the other axis you should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m54s)
00:40:54

[see that they just about form a line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m56s)
00:40:56

[right and if they don't then that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h40m59s)
00:40:59

[very strong suggestion that you screwed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m02s)

[example okay can you pass that one to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m07s)
00:41:07

[the end of that room possible instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m10s)
00:41:10

[once those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m12s)
00:41:12

[yes so your so for a problem like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m14s)
00:41:14

[unlike the car insurance problem on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m20s)
00:41:20

[taggle where we don't wear columns are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m22s)
00:41:22

[unnamed we know we know what the columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m25s)
00:41:25

[representing what they are do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m29s)
00:41:29

[how often do you pull in data from other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m31s)
00:41:31

[sources to supplement that I mean you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m33s)
00:41:33

[could maybe like weather data or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m37s)
00:41:37

[know for example or how often is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m41s)
00:41:41

[used very often right and so the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m43s)
00:41:43

[point of this star schema is that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m46s)
00:41:46

[break the second table and then you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m50s)
00:41:50

[got these other tables coming on third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[that provide metadata about it so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m53s)
00:41:53

[example whether it's meditating about a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m56s)
00:41:56

[date yeah on cattle specifically most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h41m58s)
00:41:58

[competitions have the rule that you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m04s)
00:42:04

[use external data as long as you post on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m06s)
00:42:06

[the forum that you're using it and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m10s)
00:42:10

[it's publicly available but you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m13s)
00:42:13

[check on a competition by competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[basis they will tell you outside of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m18s)
00:42:18

[cattle you should always be looking or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m20s)
00:42:20

[like what external data could I possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m23s)
00:42:23

[leverage here okay so are we still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m26s)
00:42:26

[talking about how to tweak this data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[if you wish well I'm not familiar with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m39s)
00:42:39

[the countries here so maybe he's Ecuador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m43s)
00:42:43

[Ecuador so maybe I would Ecuador largest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m45s)
00:42:45

[grocery chain Ecuador is largest first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m49s)
00:42:49

[chain maybe I would start looking for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m51s)
00:42:51

[Ecuador's holidays and shopping holidays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m54s)
00:42:54

[maybe when they have a three-day weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m57s)
00:42:57

[or you know I've actually that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h42m59s)
00:42:59

[information is provided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m00s)
00:43:00

[in this case and so in general one way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[of tackling this kind of problem is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m06s)
00:43:06

[create lots and lots of new columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[containing things like you know average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m13s)
00:43:13

[number of sales on holidays average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m15s)
00:43:15

[percent change in sale or between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m18s)
00:43:18

[January and February and so on and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m20s)
00:43:20

[forth and so if you have a look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[there's been a previous competition on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m26s)
00:43:26

[cattle Rossman store sales that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m28s)
00:43:28

[almost identical it was in Germany in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m32s)
00:43:32

[this case for a major grocery chain how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m36s)
00:43:36

[many items are sold by day by item type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m38s)
00:43:38

[by store and the this case the person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m41s)
00:43:41

[who won quite unusually actually was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m46s)
00:43:46

[something of a domain expert in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m49s)
00:43:49

[space they're actually a specialist in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m50s)
00:43:50

[doing logistics predictions and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m53s)
00:43:53

[basically what they did was professional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m56s)
00:43:56

[sales forecast consultant ping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h43m59s)
00:43:59

[he created just lots and lots and lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m03s)
00:44:03

[of columns based on his experience of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m06s)
00:44:06

[what kinds of things can be useful for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m08s)
00:44:08

[making predictions to that but that's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m11s)
00:44:11

[approach that can work the third-place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[team did almost no feature engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m17s)
00:44:17

[however and also they had one big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m20s)
00:44:20

[oversight which I think they would have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m23s)
00:44:23

[won so you don't necessarily have to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m25s)
00:44:25

[this approach so we're learning anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m28s)
00:44:28

[we'll be learning a lot more about how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m31s)
00:44:31

[to win this competition and ones like as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m32s)
00:44:32

[we go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m37s)
00:44:37

[they did it to you the third question so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m39s)
00:44:39

[if you google for among cattle rustlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m41s)
00:44:41

[you'll see it the short answer is there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m44s)
00:44:44

[is a big blow so what are the things and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m46s)
00:44:46

[these are a couple of charts that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m51s)
00:44:51

[Terrence is actually my teammate on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m53s)
00:44:53

[competition so parents drew a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m54s)
00:44:54

[these charts for us and I want to talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[about this which is if you don't have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h44m59s)
00:44:59

[good validation set it's it's hard if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m02s)
00:45:02

[not impossible to create a good model so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m06s)
00:45:06

[in other words like if you're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m09s)
00:45:09

[predict next month's sales and you build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m12s)
00:45:12

[a bunch you know you try to build a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m16s)
00:45:16

[model and you have no way of really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m18s)
00:45:18

[knowing whether the models you've built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m20s)
00:45:20

[are good at predicting sales a month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m22s)
00:45:22

[ahead of time then you have no way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m24s)
00:45:24

[knowing when you put your model in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m26s)
00:45:26

[production whether it's actually going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m27s)
00:45:27

[to be any good okay so so you need a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m29s)
00:45:29

[validation set that you know is reliable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m33s)
00:45:33

[and telling you whether or not your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m36s)
00:45:36

[model is likely to work well when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m39s)
00:45:39

[like put it into production or use it on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m42s)
00:45:42

[the test set so in this case what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m45s)
00:45:45

[Terrance has plotted here is and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m49s)
00:45:49

[normally you should not use your test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m52s)
00:45:52

[set for anything other than using it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m54s)
00:45:54

[right at the end of the competition all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m57s)
00:45:57

[right end of the project to find out how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h45m58s)
00:45:58

[you've got but there's one thing I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m01s)
00:46:01

[going to let you use the test set for an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m03s)
00:46:03

[addition and that is to calibrate your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m05s)
00:46:05

[validation set so what Terrance did here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m07s)
00:46:07

[was he built four different models right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m10s)
00:46:10

[some which he thought would be better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m13s)
00:46:13

[than others and he submitted each of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m15s)
00:46:15

[four models to cattle to find out its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[score and so the x-axis is the score the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m20s)
00:46:20

[cattle produce on the leaderboard okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m24s)
00:46:24

[and then on the y-axis he plotted the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m27s)
00:46:27

[score on a particular validation set he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[was trying out to see whether this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m33s)
00:46:33

[validation said look like it was going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m35s)
00:46:35

[to be any good so if your validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m37s)
00:46:37

[is good then the relationship between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m42s)
00:46:42

[the leaderboards for by the testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m44s)
00:46:44

[score and your validation set score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m47s)
00:46:47

[should lie in a straight line ideally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[it'll actually lie on the y equals x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m52s)
00:46:52

[line but honestly that doesn't matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m55s)
00:46:55

[too much as long as relatively speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h46m58s)
00:46:58

[it tells you which models are better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m00s)
00:47:00

[than which other models then you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m02s)
00:47:02

[which model is the best right and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m04s)
00:47:04

[know how it's going to perform on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m07s)
00:47:07

[test set because you know the linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m09s)
00:47:09

[relationship between two things okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m11s)
00:47:11

[in this case Terrence has managed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m13s)
00:47:13

[come up with a validation set which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m15s)
00:47:15

[looking like it's going to predict our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m18s)
00:47:18

[tab or leaderboards for pretty well and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m19s)
00:47:19

[that's really cool right because don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m21s)
00:47:21

[even go away and try a hundred different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[types of models feature engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m25s)
00:47:25

[waiting twigs paper parameters whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m27s)
00:47:27

[else see how they go on the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m30s)
00:47:30

[set and not have to submit to tackle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m32s)
00:47:32

[right so we're going to get a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m34s)
00:47:34

[iterations one more feedback this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m35s)
00:47:35

[just true of cattle but every machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m38s)
00:47:38

[learning project you do yeah and so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m40s)
00:47:40

[you find so here's a different one he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m43s)
00:47:43

[tried back where it wasn't as good right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m45s)
00:47:45

[it's like oh these ones that were quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m48s)
00:47:48

[close to each other it's showing us the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m50s)
00:47:50

[opposite direction that's a really bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m52s)
00:47:52

[sign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m53s)
00:47:53

[it's like okay this validation set idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m54s)
00:47:54

[didn't seem like a good idea this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m57s)
00:47:57

[validation set idea did number one good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h47m59s)
00:47:59

[idea so in general if your validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m01s)
00:48:01

[set it's not showing a nice straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m03s)
00:48:03

[line you need to think carefully like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[okay how is the test set constructor why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m07s)
00:48:07

[how is my validation set different in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m09s)
00:48:09

[some way you're constructing images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m12s)
00:48:12

[which is different but I have to draw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m14s)
00:48:14

[lots of charts and so forth so one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m16s)
00:48:16

[question is and I modified two to guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m23s)
00:48:23

[how how you did it so how they actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m25s)
00:48:25

[tried to construct this validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m28s)
00:48:28

[us close today so I would try to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m30s)
00:48:30

[to try to sample points from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m33s)
00:48:33

[training set that are very closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m36s)
00:48:36

[possible to some of the points in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m38s)
00:48:38

[test set first in what sense and I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m41s)
00:48:41

[know I will have to find any lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m43s)
00:48:43

[but in this case for this first room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m46s)
00:48:46

[4030 scrotus the last points was trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m48s)
00:48:48

[variations off someplace right so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h48m57s)
00:48:57

[most recent you know and what I noticed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m00s)
00:49:00

[was so first I looked at the date range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m03s)
00:49:03

[of the test set and then I looked at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m05s)
00:49:05

[the kernel that described how he or she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m11s)
00:49:11

[here's the date range of the last two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m15s)
00:49:15

[weeks of August 26 that's right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m17s)
00:49:17

[the person who submitted the kernel that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m21s)
00:49:21

[said how to get the 0.58 leaderboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m24s)
00:49:24

[position or whatever sport everything I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m26s)
00:49:26

[looked at the date range of that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m29s)
00:49:29

[that was well there was actually 14 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m32s)
00:49:32

[and the test set is 16 days but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m36s)
00:49:36

[interesting thing is the test set begins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m39s)
00:49:39

[on the day after pay day and ends on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m43s)
00:49:43

[pay day and so these are things I also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m46s)
00:49:46

[paid attention to but and I think that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m49s)
00:49:49

[one of the bits of better data that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m54s)
00:49:54

[told us you know so these are the kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m56s)
00:49:56

[of things you just put a like try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h49m58s)
00:49:58

[like I said trick plot lots of pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m01s)
00:50:01

[and like even if you didn't know it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[pay day you know you would want to like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m05s)
00:50:05

[draw the time series part of sales and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m06s)
00:50:06

[you would hopefully see that like every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m09s)
00:50:09

[two weeks so it'd be a spike or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m11s)
00:50:11

[you'd be like oh I want to make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m13s)
00:50:13

[that mine I have the same number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m14s)
00:50:14

[spikes in my validation set that I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m17s)
00:50:17

[had in my test day okay let's take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m20s)
00:50:20

[five-minute break and let's come back at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[2:30 to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m26s)
00:50:26

[okay so um this is my favorite bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m36s)
00:50:36

[interpreting machine learning models by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m40s)
00:50:40

[the way if you're looking for my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m44s)
00:50:44

[notebook about the groceries competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[you won't find it in github because I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m50s)
00:50:50

[not allowed to share code for running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[competitions with you unless you're on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m55s)
00:50:55

[the same team as me after the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h50m57s)
00:50:57

[competition is finished it'll be on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m00s)
00:51:00

[github so if you're doing this for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m01s)
00:51:01

[video you should be able to find it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m04s)
00:51:04

[so let's start by reading in our feather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m06s)
00:51:06

[file so after the file is exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m15s)
00:51:15

[same as our CSV file this Israel Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m17s)
00:51:17

[Book for bulldozers competition so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[trying to predict the sale price of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m22s)
00:51:22

[every industrial equipment adoption and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m24s)
00:51:24

[so reading the feather format by all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m27s)
00:51:27

[means that we've already read in the CSV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m29s)
00:51:29

[and processed it into categories and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m32s)
00:51:32

[the next thing we do is to run property](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m36s)
00:51:36

[F in order to turn the categories into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m37s)
00:51:37

[integers deal with the missing values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m40s)
00:51:40

[and pull out the hidden variable okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m42s)
00:51:42

[this is exactly the same thing as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m45s)
00:51:45

[used last time to create a validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m48s)
00:51:48

[set where the validation set represents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m50s)
00:51:50

[the last couple of weeks the last twelve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h51m52s)

[discovered thanks to one of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m00s)

[excellent questions on the forum last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m03s)
00:52:03

[week I had a bug here which is that proc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m04s)
00:52:04

[Pierre was shuffling the order sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m10s)
00:52:10

[so doc Proctor yes and last week we saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m18s)
00:52:18

[a particular version of property earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m21s)
00:52:21

[where we passed in a subset and when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m26s)
00:52:26

[passed in a subset it was randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m29s)
00:52:29

[shuffling and so then i said split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m31s)
00:52:31

[bowels it wasn't getting the last rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m33s)
00:52:33

[by date but it was getting a random set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m37s)
00:52:37

[of roads so I've now fixed that so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m39s)
00:52:39

[you really run the lesson 1rf code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m42s)
00:52:42

[you'll see slightly different results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m45s)
00:52:45

[specifically you'll see in that section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m48s)
00:52:48

[that my validation set results look less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m50s)
00:52:50

[good but that's only for this tiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m53s)
00:52:53

[little bit where I had subset equals yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h52m55s)
00:52:55

[I'm a little bit confused about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m03s)
00:53:03

[notation here so only as is most a input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m05s)
00:53:05

[variable and this associate variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m09s)
00:53:09

[dysfunction and yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[why is thatis the proc DF returns a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m13s)
00:53:13

[dictionary telling you which things were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m20s)
00:53:20

[missing which columns are missing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[for each of those columns what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m25s)
00:53:25

[median was so when you call it on like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m27s)
00:53:27

[the larger data set the non subset you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m33s)
00:53:33

[want to take that return value and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m37s)
00:53:37

[don't pass in an energy to that weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m39s)
00:53:39

[you just want to get back a result later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m42s)
00:53:42

[on when he planted into a subset you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m44s)
00:53:44

[want to use to have the same missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m46s)
00:53:46

[columns and the same medians and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m48s)
00:53:48

[pass it in and if like this different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m50s)
00:53:50

[subsets like if it was a whole different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m54s)
00:53:54

[data set turned out had some different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m56s)
00:53:56

[missing columns it would update that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h53m59s)
00:53:59

[dictionary with some with additional key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m01s)
00:54:01

[values as well so it kind of you can you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m04s)
00:54:04

[don't have to pass it in if you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m08s)
00:54:08

[pass it in but it just gives you gives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m11s)
00:54:11

[you the information about what was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m12s)
00:54:12

[missing and the medians if you do a sit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m14s)
00:54:14

[in it uses that information for any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m16s)
00:54:16

[missing columns that that are there and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m20s)
00:54:20

[if there are some new missing columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m22s)
00:54:22

[that will update that dictionary with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m24s)
00:54:24

[that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m26s)
00:54:26

[so it's like keeping our datasets common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m27s)
00:54:27

[information yeah it's got a keep track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m31s)
00:54:31

[of all any any missing columns that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m33s)
00:54:33

[came across in any of anything you pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m35s)
00:54:35

[the property yeah thank you okay so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m36s)
00:54:36

[split it into the training and test set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m43s)
00:54:43

[just like we did last week and so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m44s)
00:54:44

[remind you once we've done crop DF this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m47s)
00:54:47

[is what it looks like this is the log of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m51s)
00:54:51

[sale price okay so the first thing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m52s)
00:54:52

[think about is we already know how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h54m56s)
00:54:56

[get the predictions right which is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m00s)
00:55:00

[prediction but normally we don't just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m14s)
00:55:14

[want a prediction we also want to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m17s)
00:55:17

[how confident we are of that prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m20s)
00:55:20

[and so we would be less confident of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m22s)
00:55:22

[prediction if we haven't seen many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m25s)
00:55:25

[examples of roads like this one and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m28s)
00:55:28

[we haven't seen many examples of roads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m33s)
00:55:33

[like this one then we wouldn't expect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m35s)
00:55:35

[any of the trees kind of have a path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m37s)
00:55:37

[through which which is really designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m40s)
00:55:40

[to help us predict that road and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m44s)
00:55:44

[conceptually you would expect then that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m47s)
00:55:47

[as you pass this unusual row through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m50s)

[different trees it's going to going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[end up in very different places so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m55s)
00:55:55

[other words rather than just taking the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h55m58s)
00:55:58

[mean of the predictions of the trees and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m00s)
00:56:00

[saying that's a prediction what if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m03s)
00:56:03

[took the standard deviation of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m05s)
00:56:05

[predictions of the trees so the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m08s)
00:56:08

[trees if that's high that means each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m12s)

[tree is giving us a very different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m16s)
00:56:16

[estimate of this rose prediction so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m20s)
00:56:20

[this was a really common kind of row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m24s)
00:56:24

[right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m27s)
00:56:27

[then the trees follow forward to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m29s)
00:56:29

[good predictions for it because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m33s)
00:56:33

[same lots of opportunities to split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m34s)
00:56:34

[based on those kinds of roads right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m36s)
00:56:36

[the standard deviation of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m39s)
00:56:39

[predictions across the trees gives us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m42s)
00:56:42

[some kind of at least relative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m45s)
00:56:45

[understanding of how confident we are of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m48s)
00:56:48

[this prediction so that is not something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m53s)
00:56:53

[which exists in scikit-learn or in any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h56m58s)
00:56:58

[library I know of so we have to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m04s)
00:57:04

[it but we already have almost the exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m07s)
00:57:07

[code we need because remember last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m09s)
00:57:09

[lesson we actually manually calculated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m11s)
00:57:11

[the averages across different sets of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m14s)
00:57:14

[trees so we can do exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m16s)
00:57:16

[thing there calculate the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[deviations so we know I'm doing random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m20s)
00:57:20

[forest interpretation I pretty much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m24s)
00:57:24

[never use the full data set I always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m26s)
00:57:26

[call set our samples because like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m28s)
00:57:28

[don't need a massively accurate random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m32s)
00:57:32

[forest we just need one which indicates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m35s)
00:57:35

[the nature of relationships involved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m38s)
00:57:38

[right and so I just make sure this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m41s)
00:57:41

[number is high enough that if I call the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m43s)
00:57:43

[same interpretation commands multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m46s)
00:57:46

[times I don't get different results back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[each time that's like the rule of thumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m51s)
00:57:51

[about how big does it need to be right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m53s)
00:57:53

[but in practice like 50,000 is an odd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m56s)
00:57:56

[number and most of the time you know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h57m58s)
00:57:58

[would be surprising if that wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m01s)
00:58:01

[enough and it runs in seconds so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m02s)
00:58:02

[generally start with 50,000 so with my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m05s)
00:58:05

[50,000 samples per tree set I create 40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m08s)
00:58:08

[estimators I know from last time that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m12s)
00:58:12

[min samples we people three max features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m15s)
00:58:15

[it cost point five isn't bad and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m17s)
00:58:17

[we're not trying to create the world's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m19s)
00:58:19

[most predictive tree anyway so that all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m20s)
00:58:20

[sounds fine we get an r-squared on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m23s)
00:58:23

[validation set of 0.89 again we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m26s)
00:58:26

[particularly care but it's long as it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m29s)
00:58:29

[good enough which it certainly is and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m32s)
00:58:32

[here's where we can do that exact same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m35s)
00:58:35

[list comprehension as last time remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m37s)
00:58:37

[go through each estimator at each tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m39s)
00:58:39

[call drop predict on it with our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m42s)
00:58:42

[validation set make that a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m45s)
00:58:45

[comprehension and pass that to NP stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m47s)
00:58:47

[which in catenate s-- everything in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m49s)
00:58:49

[list across a new axis okay so now our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m52s)
00:58:52

[rows are the results of each tree and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m56s)
00:58:56

[their columns are the result of each row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h58m59s)
00:58:59

[in the original data set and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m01s)
00:59:01

[remember we can calculate the mean right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[so here's the prediction for a data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m06s)
00:59:06

[row number one and here's our standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m10s)
00:59:10

[deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m13s)
00:59:13

[okay so here's kind of do it for just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m14s)
00:59:14

[one observation right at the end here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m16s)
00:59:16

[we've calculated for all of them just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m20s)
00:59:20

[pretty nipple one here now this this can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m22s)
00:59:22

[take quite a while and specifically it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m30s)
00:59:30

[not taking advantage of the fact that my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m34s)
00:59:34

[computer has lots of cause in it list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[comprehensions this is this is like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m41s)
00:59:41

[list comprehension itself is Python code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m44s)
00:59:44

[that it's my Python code and python code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m46s)
00:59:46

[unless you're doing special stuff runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m48s)
00:59:48

[in serial which means it runs on a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m52s)
00:59:52

[single CPU doesn't take advantage of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m54s)
00:59:54

[your multi CPU hardware and so if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m56s)
00:59:56

[wanted to run this you know on more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=00h59m59s)
00:59:59

[trees and more data you know this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m01s)
01:00:01

[second is going to go out and you see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m04s)
01:00:04

[here the wall time the amount of actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[climate talk is roughly equal to the CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m07s)
01:00:07

[time where else if it was running on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m10s)
01:00:10

[lots of cause the CPU time would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m12s)
01:00:12

[higher than the war time so it turns out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m14s)
01:00:14

[that scikit-learn provides a handy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m17s)
01:00:17

[national circuit load fast AI provides a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m22s)
01:00:22

[handy function called parallel trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[which pulls some stuff inside cyclone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m28s)
01:00:28

[and parallel trees takes two things it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m30s)
01:00:30

[takes a random forest model that I train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m34s)
01:00:34

[the here it is and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m37s)
01:00:37

[and some function to call and it calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m39s)
01:00:39

[that function on every tree in parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m43s)
01:00:43

[so in other words rather than calling T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m46s)
01:00:46

[I predict X ballad let's create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m49s)
01:00:49

[function that calls T dot predict X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m51s)
01:00:51

[salad let's use parallel trees to call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m53s)
01:00:53

[it on our model to every tree okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m56s)
01:00:56

[it will return a list of the result of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h00m59s)
01:00:59

[applying that function to every tree and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m03s)
01:01:03

[so then we can NP Don stack that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m06s)
01:01:06

[hopefully you can see that that code and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m09s)
01:01:09

[that code are basically the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m12s)
01:01:12

[right but this one is doing it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m15s)
01:01:15

[parallel and so you can see here now our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m17s)
01:01:17

[wall time has gone down to 500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m21s)
01:01:21

[milliseconds and it's now giving this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m25s)
01:01:25

[exactly the same answer okay so a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m29s)
01:01:29

[bit faster time committing we'll talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m31s)
01:01:31

[about more general ways of writing code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m34s)
01:01:34

[that runs in parallel that turns out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m37s)
01:01:37

[be super useful for data science but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m39s)
01:01:39

[here's one that we can use it's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m41s)
01:01:41

[specific to random forests okay so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m43s)
01:01:43

[we can now do is we can always call this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m49s)
01:01:49

[to get our predictions for each tree and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m51s)
01:01:51

[then we can call standard deviation to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m56s)
01:01:56

[then get them for every row and so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h01m57s)
01:01:57

[try using that so what I could do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m02s)
01:02:02

[let's carried a copy of our data and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m05s)
01:02:05

[let's add an additional column to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m08s)
01:02:08

[which is the standard deviation of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m10s)
01:02:10

[predictions across the first axis okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m12s)
01:02:12

[and let's also add in the name so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m16s)
01:02:16

[they're the predictions themselves so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m20s)
01:02:20

[you might remember from last lesson that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m25s)
01:02:25

[one of the predictors we have is called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m28s)
01:02:28

[enclosure and we'll see later on but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m32s)
01:02:32

[this is an important predictor and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m35s)
01:02:35

[let's start by just doing a histogram so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m38s)
01:02:38

[one of the nice things and panders is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m40s)
01:02:40

[it's got built in body and capabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m41s)
01:02:41

[it's well worth googling for pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m44s)
01:02:44

[plotting to see how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m46s)
01:02:46

[yes Terrence Jeremy can you remind me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m48s)
01:02:48

[what enclosure is so we don't know what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m53s)
01:02:53

[means and it doesn't matter you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h02m59s)
01:02:59

[like that's the whole purpose of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[process is that we're going to pick it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m04s)
01:03:04

[out we're going to learn about what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m06s)
01:03:06

[things are or at least what things are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m08s)
01:03:08

[important and what later on figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[what they are and how they're important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m11s)
01:03:11

[so we're going to start out knowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m12s)
01:03:12

[nothing about this data set all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m14s)
01:03:14

[there's something so I'm just going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m17s)
01:03:17

[look at something called enclosure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m19s)
01:03:19

[has something called erupts and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[something called robots and I don't even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m21s)
01:03:21

[know what this is yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m22s)
01:03:22

[all I know is that the only three that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m23s)
01:03:23

[really appear at any great quantity are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m26s)
01:03:26

[over ops erupts whe and eros and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m28s)
01:03:28

[like really common as a data scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m32s)
01:03:32

[you know you often find yourself looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m34s)
01:03:34

[at data that you're not that familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m36s)
01:03:36

[with and you've got to figure out at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m37s)
01:03:37

[baseline which fits to study more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m39s)
01:03:39

[carefully and which gets into matter and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m41s)
01:03:41

[so forth so in this case at least know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m43s)
01:03:43

[that these three groups I really don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[care about because they basically don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[exist so given that we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m48s)
01:03:48

[ignore those three so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[focus on this one here this one here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m55s)
01:03:55

[this one here and so here you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h03m58s)
01:03:58

[what I've done is I've taken my data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m01s)
01:04:01

[frame and I've grouped by enclosure and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m06s)
01:04:06

[I am taking the average of these three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m11s)
01:04:11

[fields so here you can see here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m16s)
01:04:16

[average sale price the average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m18s)
01:04:18

[prediction and the standard deviation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m20s)
01:04:20

[prediction for each of my three groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m22s)
01:04:22

[so I can already start to learn a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m24s)
01:04:24

[here as you would expect the prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[and the sale price are close to each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[other on average so that's a good sign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m33s)
01:04:33

[and then the standard deviation varies a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m36s)
01:04:36

[little bit it's a little hard to see in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m41s)
01:04:41

[a table so what we could do is we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m42s)
01:04:42

[try to start like printing these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m47s)
01:04:47

[out so here we've got the sale price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m49s)
01:04:49

[or each little of enclosure and here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m55s)
01:04:55

[we've got the prediction peach level of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h04m58s)
01:04:58

[enclosure and for the error bars I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m00s)
01:05:00

[using the standard deviation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m03s)
01:05:03

[perdition alright so here you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m04s)
01:05:04

[the actual and here's the prediction and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m06s)
01:05:06

[here's my confidence in the world okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m09s)
01:05:09

[or at least it's the average of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m15s)
01:05:15

[standard deviation of the random forests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m18s)
01:05:18

[so this tells us it'll tell us if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m21s)
01:05:21

[there's some groups or some rows that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m24s)
01:05:24

[we're not very confident of it all so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m26s)
01:05:26

[could do something similar for product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[size right so here's different product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m31s)
01:05:31

[sizes we can do exactly the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m34s)
01:05:34

[of looking at our predictions under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m37s)
01:05:37

[standard deviations okay we could sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m40s)
01:05:40

[by and what we could say is like well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m43s)
01:05:43

[what's the ratio of the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m46s)
01:05:46

[deviation of the predictions to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m48s)
01:05:48

[predictions and selves right so you kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m50s)
01:05:50

[of expect on average that when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m52s)
01:05:52

[predicting something that's a bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m54s)
01:05:54

[number that your standard deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m55s)
01:05:55

[would be higher all right so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m57s)
01:05:57

[like sort by that ratio and what that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h05m59s)
01:05:59

[tells us is that the product size large](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m02s)
01:06:02

[and product size compact our predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m05s)
01:06:05

[are less accurate you know as relatively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m09s)
01:06:09

[speaking as a ratio of the total price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m12s)
01:06:12

[and so then if we go back and have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m14s)
01:06:14

[look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m16s)
01:06:16

[well there you go that's why for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m18s)
01:06:18

[histogram those are the smallest groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m20s)
01:06:20

[okay so as you would expect in small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m22s)
01:06:22

[groups we're doing the less good job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m26s)
01:06:26

[right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m28s)
01:06:28

[so this confidence interval you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m29s)
01:06:29

[really use for two main purposes one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m32s)
01:06:32

[that you can group it up like this and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[look at the average confidence interval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m36s)
01:06:36

[by group to find out are there some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m38s)
01:06:38

[groups that you just don't seem to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m41s)
01:06:41

[confidence about about those groups but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m43s)
01:06:43

[perhaps more importantly you can look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m47s)
01:06:47

[them for specific roads and so when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m49s)
01:06:49

[put it in production you might always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m51s)
01:06:51

[want to see the confidence interval so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m53s)
01:06:53

[if you're doing say credit scoring so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m56s)
01:06:56

[deciding whether to give somebody alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h06m59s)
01:06:59

[you probably want to see not only what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m00s)
01:07:00

[their level of risk but how confident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m03s)
01:07:03

[are we and if they want to borrow lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m05s)
01:07:05

[of money and we're not at all confident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m07s)
01:07:07

[or about our ability to predict whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[they'll pay it back we might want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m11s)
01:07:11

[give them a small amount okay so those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m13s)
01:07:13

[are the two ways in which you reduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m16s)
01:07:16

[this okay let me go to the next one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m18s)
01:07:18

[which is the most important the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m22s)
01:07:22

[important is feature importance and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m24s)
01:07:24

[only reason I didn't do this first is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m28s)
01:07:28

[because I think the intuitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m30s)
01:07:30

[understanding of how to calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[confidence interval is the easiest one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m33s)
01:07:33

[to understand entry in fact it's almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m35s)
01:07:35

[identical to something we've already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m37s)
01:07:37

[happened right but in terms of which one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m39s)
01:07:39

[do I look at first in practice I always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[look at this in Baptist so when I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m45s)
01:07:45

[working on whether it be a candle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m47s)
01:07:47

[competition or a real world project I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[build a random forest as fast as I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m52s)
01:07:52

[try and get it to the point that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m57s)
01:07:57

[led you know significantly better than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h07m58s)
01:07:58

[Brandon but doesn't actually much better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m01s)
01:08:01

[than that and then the next thing I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m03s)
01:08:03

[is to plot the future importance and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m04s)
01:08:04

[future importance tells us in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m07s)
01:08:07

[random forest which columns mattered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m10s)
01:08:10

[right so we had like dozens and dozens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m16s)
01:08:16

[but of columns originally in this data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m18s)
01:08:18

[set and here I'm just picking out the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m21s)
01:08:21

[top ten so you can just call our F](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m23s)
01:08:23

[feature importance again this is part of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[important was each column and here on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m45s)
01:08:45

[this note pick out the top ten so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m47s)
01:08:47

[then plot that right so fi because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h08m51s)

[of the future importances right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m02s)
01:09:02

[you can see here like and I haven't been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m05s)
01:09:05

[able to write all of the names of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m07s)
01:09:07

[columns at the bottom which that's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m09s)
01:09:09

[the important thing the important thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m11s)
01:09:11

[is to see that some columns are really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m12s)
01:09:12

[really important and most columns don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m15s)
01:09:15

[really matter at all and like in nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[every data set you use in real life this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m21s)
01:09:21

[is what your feature importance is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m24s)
01:09:24

[to look like it's going to say there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m26s)
01:09:26

[like a handful of columns that you care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m28s)
01:09:28

[about and this is why I always start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m30s)
01:09:30

[here right because at this point in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m32s)
01:09:32

[terms of like looking into learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m34s)
01:09:34

[about this domain heavy industrial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m37s)
01:09:37

[equipment options I only got to care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m41s)
01:09:41

[about learning about the columns which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m43s)
01:09:43

[matter right so are we going to bother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m45s)
01:09:45

[learning about enclosure depends whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m48s)
01:09:48

[enclosure is important and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m50s)
01:09:50

[there it is it's in the top ten so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m55s)
01:09:55

[are going to have to learn about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m57s)
01:09:57

[enclosure okay so then we could also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h09m58s)
01:09:58

[plot this as a bar plot all right so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m01s)
01:10:01

[can hear I've just created a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m05s)
01:10:05

[little tiny little function here that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m06s)
01:10:06

[going to just plot my bars and I'm just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m08s)
01:10:08

[going to do it for the top 30 and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[can see the same basic shape here and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m15s)
01:10:15

[can see there's my enclosure okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m18s)
01:10:18

[so we're going to learn about how this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[is calculated in just a moment but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m24s)
01:10:24

[before you worry about how it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m27s)
01:10:27

[calculated much more important is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m28s)
01:10:28

[know what to do with it so the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m29s)
01:10:29

[important thing to do with it is to now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m31s)
01:10:31

[sit down with your client or your data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m33s)
01:10:33

[dictionary or whatever your source of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m37s)
01:10:37

[information is and say to them okay tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m39s)
01:10:39

[me about you made what does that mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m42s)
01:10:42

[where does it come from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m44s)
01:10:44

[plot lots of things like histogram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m46s)
01:10:46

[Devere made and scatter plots of here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m48s)
01:10:48

[made against price and learn everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m50s)
01:10:50

[you can because you're made and cupola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m51s)
01:10:51

[system they're the things that matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m54s)
01:10:54

[right and what will often happen in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m55s)
01:10:55

[real-world projects is that you'll sit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m57s)
01:10:57

[with the client and you'll say oh it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h10m59s)
01:10:59

[turns out the capital system is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m02s)
01:11:02

[second most important thing and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m03s)
01:11:03

[they might say that makes no sense now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m05s)
01:11:05

[that doesn't mean that there's a problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m08s)
01:11:08

[with your model it means there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m10s)
01:11:10

[problem with their understanding of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m12s)
01:11:12

[data that they gave you okay so let me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[give you an example I entered a cattle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m17s)
01:11:17

[competition where the goal was to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[predict which applications for grants at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m21s)
01:11:21

[a university would be successful and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m24s)
01:11:24

[used this exact approach and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m28s)
01:11:28

[discovered a number of columns which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m30s)
01:11:30

[were almost entirely predictive of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m32s)
01:11:32

[dependent variable and specifically when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m34s)
01:11:34

[I then looked to see in what way their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m37s)
01:11:37

[predictive it turned out whether they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m38s)
01:11:38

[were missing or not was basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m40s)
01:11:40

[only thing that mattered in his data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m43s)
01:11:43

[and so later on so I ended up winning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m45s)
01:11:45

[that competition and I think a lot of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m49s)
01:11:49

[was thanks to this insight right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m51s)
01:11:51

[later on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m53s)
01:11:53

[what had happened it turns out that at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m55s)
01:11:55

[that University there's you know there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h11m57s)
01:11:57

[an administrative burden to fill any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m00s)
01:12:00

[other database and so for a lot of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m02s)
01:12:02

[grant applications they don't fill in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m04s)
01:12:04

[the database for the folks whose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m06s)
01:12:06

[applications weren't accepted right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m09s)
01:12:09

[in other words these missing values in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m11s)
01:12:11

[the data set were saying okay this grant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m14s)
01:12:14

[wasn't accepted because if it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m17s)
01:12:17

[accepted then you know the admin folks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m19s)
01:12:19

[are going to go in and type in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m21s)
01:12:21

[information so this is what we call data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m23s)
01:12:23

[leakage and data leakage means there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m26s)
01:12:26

[information in the data set that I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[modeling with which the university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m31s)
01:12:31

[wouldn't have had in real life at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m34s)
01:12:34

[point in time they were making a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m36s)
01:12:36

[decision right so when they're deciding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m37s)
01:12:37

[you know which grant applications should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m40s)
01:12:40

[I like prioritize they don't actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m44s)
01:12:44

[know which ones the admin staff or later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m47s)
01:12:47

[I'm going to add information to because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m50s)
01:12:50

[it turns out that they've got accepted I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m52s)
01:12:52

[mean right so one of the key things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m53s)
01:12:53

[you'll find here is is data leakage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h12m57s)
01:12:57

[problems and that's a serious problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m00s)
01:13:00

[you need to deal with the other thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m03s)
01:13:03

[that will happen is you'll often find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[it's signs of collinearity and I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m09s)
01:13:09

[that's what's happened here with kapwa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m12s)
01:13:12

[system I think Kapler system tells you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m13s)
01:13:13

[whether or not a particular kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m16s)
01:13:16

[heavy industrial equipment has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m18s)
01:13:18

[particular feature on it but if it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m19s)
01:13:19

[that kind of industrial equipment at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m23s)
01:13:23

[it will be empty they'll be missing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m25s)
01:13:25

[so capitalist system is really telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m27s)
01:13:27

[you whether or not it's a certain class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m29s)
01:13:29

[of heavy industrial equipment now this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m32s)
01:13:32

[is not linkage this is actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m34s)
01:13:34

[information you actually have at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m36s)
01:13:36

[right time it's just that like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m37s)
01:13:37

[interpreting it you have to be careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m39s)
01:13:39

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m42s)
01:13:42

[so I would go through at least the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m45s)
01:13:45

[10 or like kind of look for where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[natural breakpoints are and really study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m48s)
01:13:48

[these things carefully to make life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m50s)
01:13:50

[easier for myself what I tend to do is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m53s)
01:13:53

[try to throw some data away and see if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m56s)
01:13:56

[that matters so in this case I had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[random forest which let's go and see how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m01s)
01:14:01

[accurate it was point eight nine point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m06s)
01:14:06

[eight eight nine what I did was I said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m12s)
01:14:12

[here okay let's go through our feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m14s)
01:14:14

[importance data frame and filter out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m16s)
01:14:16

[those where the importance is greater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m19s)
01:14:19

[than 0.005 thanks 0.025 two point zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m21s)
01:14:21

[five is about here right it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m27s)
01:14:27

[like where they really flattened off all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m29s)
01:14:29

[right so let's just keep those and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m32s)
01:14:32

[that gives us a list of 25 column names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m38s)
01:14:38

[and so then I say okay let's now create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m41s)
01:14:41

[a new data frame view which just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m44s)
01:14:44

[contains those 25 columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m47s)
01:14:47

[Coles flipped bowels on it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m50s)
01:14:50

[decision to test and training set and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m52s)
01:14:52

[create a new random forest and let's see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m54s)
01:14:54

[what happens and you can see here the a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h14m58s)
01:14:58

[square basically didn't change eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m03s)
01:15:03

[nine one versus eight eight nine so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m05s)
01:15:05

[actually increased a tiny bit right I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[mean generally speaking removing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m14s)
01:15:14

[redundant columns well you know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m16s)
01:15:16

[shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m19s)
01:15:19

[obviously it shouldn't make it worse if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[it makes it worse they weren't redundant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m21s)
01:15:21

[after all it might make it a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m22s)
01:15:22

[better because if you think about how we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m24s)
01:15:24

[built these trees when it's deciding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m26s)
01:15:26

[what to split on you know it's it's got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m28s)
01:15:28

[less things to have to worry about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m31s)
01:15:31

[trying it's less often going to like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m32s)
01:15:32

[accidentally find a crappy poem so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m34s)
01:15:34

[you know I've got a slightly better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m37s)
01:15:37

[opportunity to create a slightly better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m38s)
01:15:38

[tree with slightly less data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m40s)
01:15:40

[but it's still it's not going to change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m42s)
01:15:42

[it by much but it's going to make it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m43s)
01:15:43

[bit faster and it's going to let us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m45s)
01:15:45

[focus on what matters so if I rerun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m47s)
01:15:47

[feature importance now I've now got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m50s)
01:15:50

[twenty five now the key thing that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[happened is that when you remove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m56s)
01:15:56

[redundant columns is that you're also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h15m59s)
01:15:59

[removing sources of collinearity right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m02s)
01:16:02

[in other words two columns that might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m04s)
01:16:04

[related to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m06s)
01:16:06

[now Collini arity doesn't make your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[random forests less predictive but if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m12s)
01:16:12

[you have two columns that are related to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m15s)
01:16:15

[each other you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m17s)
01:16:17

[this column is a little bit related to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m19s)
01:16:19

[this column and this column is a strong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m21s)
01:16:21

[driver of the dependent variable now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m23s)
01:16:23

[what's going to happen is that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m25s)
01:16:25

[importance is going to end up like kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m26s)
01:16:26

[of split between the two collinear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m30s)
01:16:30

[columns it's going to say like well both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m32s)
01:16:32

[of those columns matter so kind of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m33s)
01:16:33

[split between the two so by removing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m35s)
01:16:35

[some of those columns with very little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m37s)
01:16:37

[impact it makes your feature importance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m41s)
01:16:41

[block clearer and so you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m43s)
01:16:43

[actually year made was pretty close to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m45s)
01:16:45

[couple system before but there must have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m50s)
01:16:50

[been a bunch of things that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m52s)
01:16:52

[collinear with year made which makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m54s)
01:16:54

[perfect sense right like old industrial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m55s)
01:16:55

[equipment wouldn't have had a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h16m57s)
01:16:57

[kind of technical features that new ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m00s)
01:17:00

[would for example so it's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m02s)
01:17:02

[saying like okay you made really really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m05s)
01:17:05

[matters all right so I trust this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m07s)
01:17:07

[feature importance better you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m10s)
01:17:10

[predictive accuracy of the model is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m13s)
01:17:13

[tiny bit better but this feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m14s)
01:17:14

[importance says a lot less familiarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m16s)
01:17:16

[to confuse us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[so let's talk about how this works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[it is actually really simple and not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m25s)
01:17:25

[only is it really simple it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m27s)
01:17:27

[technique you can use not just for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m29s)
01:17:29

[random forests but for basically any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m31s)
01:17:31

[kind of machine learning model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[interestingly almost no one knows that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[like many people will tell you all this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m42s)
01:17:42

[particular kind of model there's no way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m45s)
01:17:45

[of like interpreting it and the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m47s)
01:17:47

[important interpretation of a model is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m50s)
01:17:50

[knowing like which things are important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m51s)
01:17:51

[and that's almost certainly not going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m53s)
01:17:53

[be true because there's technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m55s)
01:17:55

[another teacher she actually works to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[any kind of model so here's what we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h17m58s)
01:17:58

[going to do we're going to take our data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m00s)
01:18:00

[set the bulldozers right and we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m01s)
01:18:01

[this column we're trying to predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m04s)
01:18:04

[right which is price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m06s)
01:18:06

[and then we've got all of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m09s)
01:18:09

[independent variables okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m11s)
01:18:11

[so here's an independent variable here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m14s)
01:18:14

[year made right plus a whole bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m16s)
01:18:16

[other variables and remember we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m21s)
01:18:21

[after we did a bit of hemming we have 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m23s)
01:18:23

[independent variables okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m25s)
01:18:25

[how do we figure out how important year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m31s)
01:18:31

[made is well we've got our whole random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m35s)
01:18:35

[first but and we can find out our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m39s)
01:18:39

[predictive accuracy where so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m41s)
01:18:41

[to put all of these rows through our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m43s)
01:18:43

[random forest and we're going to spit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m45s)
01:18:45

[out some predictions right and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m50s)
01:18:50

[going to compare them to the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m53s)
01:18:53

[price you get in this case for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m54s)
01:18:54

[our root mean squared error and our R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m57s)
01:18:57

[squared and we're going to call that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h18m59s)
01:18:59

[like it's a starting point right so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m02s)
01:19:02

[let's do exactly the same thing but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m04s)
01:19:04

[let's take the year made column and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m07s)
01:19:07

[randomly shuffle it so randomly permute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m11s)
01:19:11

[just that column so now you made has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m15s)
01:19:15

[exactly the same like distribution is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m19s)
01:19:19

[follow same mean standard deviation but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m20s)
01:19:20

[it's going to have no relationship as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m23s)
01:19:23

[dependent variable at all because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m24s)
01:19:24

[totally randomly reorder them so before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m26s)
01:19:26

[we might have found our R squared with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m29s)
01:19:29

[point eight nine right and then after we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m31s)
01:19:31

[shuffle ear made we check again and now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m34s)
01:19:34

[it's like point eight oh that's poor got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m39s)
01:19:39

[much worse when we destroyed that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m44s)
01:19:44

[variable and it's like okay let's try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m47s)
01:19:47

[again let's put your made back to how it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m50s)
01:19:50

[was and this time let's take enclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m51s)
01:19:51

[and shuttle that right and we find this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h19m56s)
01:19:56

[time an enclosure it's point at four and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[we can say okay so the amount of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m05s)
01:20:05

[decrease in our score for year made was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m08s)
01:20:08

[0.09 and the amount of decrease in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m12s)
01:20:12

[score for enclosure was 0.05 right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[this is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[and I'll feature importances for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m21s)
01:20:21

[one of our columns yes wouldn't just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m25s)
01:20:25

[excluding let's say each column I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m33s)
01:20:33

[running running the random forests and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m37s)
01:20:37

[checking the decay in the perform yes so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m39s)
01:20:39

[you could remove the column and train a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m44s)
01:20:44

[whole new random forest but that's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m46s)
01:20:46

[to be really slow where else this way we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m48s)
01:20:48

[can keep our random forest and just test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m51s)
01:20:51

[the predictive accuracy of it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m53s)
01:20:53

[alright so this is nice and fast by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m55s)
01:20:55

[comparison in this case we just have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h20m57s)
01:20:57

[rerun every row forward through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m00s)
01:21:00

[forest for each shuffle column Jason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m03s)
01:21:03

[we're just basically doing predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m07s)
01:21:07

[of exactly okay question so if you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m09s)
01:21:09

[to do like multi clone area would you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m14s)
01:21:14

[two of them and random shuffle and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m16s)
01:21:16

[three of them ran in trouble yes so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m17s)
01:21:17

[don't think you need multicollinearity I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m20s)
01:21:20

[think you mean looking for interaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m22s)
01:21:22

[effects yeah so if you want to say which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m23s)
01:21:23

[pairs of variables are most important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m26s)
01:21:26

[you could do exactly the same thing each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m28s)
01:21:28

[pair in in turn in practice there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[better ways to do that because that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m34s)
01:21:34

[obviously computationally pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m37s)
01:21:37

[expensive and so we're trying to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m39s)
01:21:39

[time to do that again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m42s)
01:21:42

[okay so we now have a model which is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m45s)
01:21:45

[little bit more accurate and is we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m49s)
01:21:49

[learned a lot more about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m52s)
01:21:52

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m54s)
01:21:54

[so we're out of time and so what I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h21m57s)
01:21:57

[suggest you try doing now before the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m00s)
01:22:00

[next class for this bulldozes data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m04s)
01:22:04

[it's like go through the top I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m06s)
01:22:06

[know five or ten predictors and try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m10s)
01:22:10

[learn what you can about how to draw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m15s)
01:22:15

[plots and pandas and try to come back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m16s)
01:22:16

[with like some insights about like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m19s)
01:22:19

[what's the relationship between a year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m21s)
01:22:21

[made and the dependent variable what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m23s)
01:22:23

[the histogram of year made you know try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m25s)
01:22:25

[and find you know some possible or like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m27s)
01:22:27

[now that you know you inmates really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m30s)
01:22:30

[important is there some noise in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m32s)
01:22:32

[column which we could fix there's some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m35s)
01:22:35

[weird encodings in that column that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m37s)
01:22:37

[we've fixed this idea I had that maybe a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m38s)
01:22:38

[couple system is there entirely because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m42s)
01:22:42

[it's collinear with something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m44s)
01:22:44

[johner we might try and figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m46s)
01:22:46

[whether that's true or so how would you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m48s)
01:22:48

[do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m50s)
01:22:50

[fi product class desk that brings alarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m51s)
01:22:51

[bells for me it sounds like it might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m56s)
01:22:56

[a high cardinality categorical variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h22m58s)
01:22:58

[it might be something with lots and lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m00s)
01:23:00

[with levels because it sounds like it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m01s)
01:23:01

[like a model name so like go and have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m03s)
01:23:03

[look at that model name does it have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m05s)
01:23:05

[some order into it could you make it an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m07s)
01:23:07

[ordinal variable to make it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m08s)
01:23:08

[it doesn't have some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m10s)
01:23:10

[hierarchical structure in the stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m11s)
01:23:11

[that we can split it on like - to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m13s)
01:23:13

[more sub columns you don't ever think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m15s)
01:23:15

[about this you know and and so try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m17s)
01:23:17

[make it so that you know by Tuesday when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m20s)
01:23:20

[you come back you've got some new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m22s)
01:23:22

[ideally you've got a better accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m25s)
01:23:25

[than what I just showed because we found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m27s)
01:23:27

[some new insights or at least that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m29s)
01:23:29

[can tell the class about some things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m32s)
01:23:32

[you've learnt about how heavy industrial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m34s)
01:23:34

[equipment options work in practice okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo#t=01h23m37s)
