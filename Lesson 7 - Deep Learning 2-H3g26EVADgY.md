[okay so last class of part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m00s)
00:00:00

[I guess the theme of part one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m05s)
00:00:05

[classification and regression with deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m09s)
00:00:09

[wading and specifically it's about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m12s)
00:00:12

[identifying and learning the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m15s)
00:00:15

[practices for classification and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m17s)
00:00:17

[regression and we started out with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m19s)
00:00:19

[kind of here are three lines of code to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m23s)
00:00:23

[do image classification and gradually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m25s)
00:00:25

[we've been for the first four lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m28s)
00:00:28

[within kind of going through NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m31s)
00:00:31

[structured data collaborative filtering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m34s)
00:00:34

[and kind of understanding some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m36s)
00:00:36

[key pieces and most importantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m38s)
00:00:38

[understanding you know how to actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m39s)
00:00:39

[make these things work well in practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m42s)
00:00:42

[and then the last three lessons are then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m44s)
00:00:44

[kind of going back over all of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m47s)
00:00:47

[topics in kind of reverse order to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m49s)
00:00:49

[understand more detail about what was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m52s)
00:00:52

[going on and understanding what the code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m53s)
00:00:53

[looks like behind the scenes and wanting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m56s)
00:00:56

[to kind of write them from scratch part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h00m57s)
00:00:57

[two of the course we'll move from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m02s)
00:01:02

[focus on classification and regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m07s)
00:01:07

[which is kind of predicting a thing like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m09s)
00:01:09

[a number or or at most a small number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m12s)
00:01:12

[things like a small number of labels and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m15s)
00:01:15

[we'll focus more on generative modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m17s)
00:01:17

[generative modeling means predicting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m20s)
00:01:20

[kind of lots of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m23s)
00:01:23

[for example creating a sentence such as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m25s)
00:01:25

[in Ural translation or image captioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m28s)
00:01:28

[or question-answering while creating an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m31s)
00:01:31

[image such as in style transfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m33s)
00:01:33

[super-resolution segmentation and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m38s)
00:01:38

[forth and then in part two it'll move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m41s)
00:01:41

[away from being just here are some best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[practices you know established best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m49s)
00:01:49

[practices either through people that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m52s)
00:01:52

[written papers or through research that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m54s)
00:01:54

[last day is done and it kind of got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m56s)
00:01:56

[convinced that these are best practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m58s)
00:01:58

[to some stuff which would be a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h01m59s)
00:01:59

[bit more speculative you know some stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m02s)
00:02:02

[which is maybe recent papers that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m04s)
00:02:04

[haven't been fully tested yet and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m07s)
00:02:07

[sometimes in part two like pickles will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[come out in the middle of the course and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m12s)
00:02:12

[will change direction with the course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m14s)
00:02:14

[and study that paper because it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m16s)
00:02:16

[you know interesting and so if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m18s)
00:02:18

[interested in kind of learning a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m20s)
00:02:20

[more about how to read a paper and how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m23s)
00:02:23

[to implement it from scratch and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m26s)
00:02:26

[forth then that's another good reason to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m28s)
00:02:28

[do part two it still doesn't assume any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m30s)
00:02:30

[particular math background but it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m34s)
00:02:34

[beyond kind of high school but but it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m37s)
00:02:37

[does assume that you're prepared to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m39s)
00:02:39

[spend time like you know digging through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m41s)
00:02:41

[the notation and understanding it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m44s)
00:02:44

[converting it to code and so forth all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[right so we're we're up to is is our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m50s)
00:02:50

[intent at the moment and I think one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[the issues I find most with teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m55s)
00:02:55

[iron ends is trying to ensure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h02m58s)
00:02:58

[people understand they're not in any way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m00s)
00:03:00

[different or unusual or magical they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m03s)
00:03:03

[they're just a standard fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m05s)
00:03:05

[Network and so let's go back to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m07s)
00:03:07

[standard fully connected Network which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m11s)
00:03:11

[looks like this right so to remind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m13s)
00:03:13

[the arrows represent one or more layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m15s)
00:03:15

[operations generally speaking a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m19s)
00:03:19

[followed by a nonlinear function in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[case their matrix modifications followed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[by real new raw or fan and the arrows of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m29s)
00:03:29

[the same color represent the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m34s)
00:03:34

[exactly the same weight matrix being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m37s)
00:03:37

[used and so one thing which was just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m39s)
00:03:39

[slightly different from previous fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m43s)
00:03:43

[connected networks we've seen is that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m45s)
00:03:45

[have an input coming in at the not just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[at the first layer but also for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m51s)
00:03:51

[second layer and also at the third layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m53s)
00:03:53

[and we tried a couple of approaches one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m54s)
00:03:54

[was concatenating the inputs and one was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m56s)
00:03:56

[adding the airport's okay but there was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h03m58s)
00:03:58

[nothing at all conceptually different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m00s)
00:04:00

[about this so that code looked like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m03s)
00:04:03

[we had a model where we basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[defined the the three arrows colors we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m15s)
00:04:15

[had as three different weight matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m18s)
00:04:18

[okay and by using the linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m19s)
00:04:19

[we got actually both the weight matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m25s)
00:04:25

[and the bias vector wrapped up for free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m26s)
00:04:26

[for us and then we went through and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m29s)
00:04:29

[did each of our embeddings put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m33s)
00:04:33

[through our first linear layer and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m35s)
00:04:35

[we did each of our we call them hiddens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m39s)
00:04:39

[being the orange orange areas and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m42s)
00:04:42

[order to avoid the fact that there's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m48s)
00:04:48

[orange arrow coming into the first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m51s)
00:04:51

[we decided to kind of invent an empty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m54s)
00:04:54

[matrix and that way every one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m57s)
00:04:57

[rows about the same right and so then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h04m59s)
00:04:59

[did exactly the same thing except we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m02s)
00:05:02

[used to loop just to refactor the cutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m08s)
00:05:08

[okay so it's just it was just a code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m11s)
00:05:11

[refactoring there was no change of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m13s)
00:05:13

[anything conceptually and since we were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m16s)
00:05:16

[doing a refactoring we took advantage of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m19s)
00:05:19

[that to increase the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m21s)
00:05:21

[characters to eight because I was too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m23s)
00:05:23

[lazy to type 8 when the alias but I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m25s)
00:05:25

[quite happy to change the loop in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m27s)
00:05:27

[stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m30s)
00:05:30

[yeah so this now looked through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m30s)
00:05:30

[exact same thing but we had eight of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[these rather than three so then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m36s)
00:05:36

[refactored that again by taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m43s)
00:05:43

[advantage of an end errand in which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m46s)
00:05:46

[basically puts that loop together for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m49s)
00:05:49

[and keeps track of the this.h as it goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m51s)
00:05:51

[along for us and so by using that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h05m57s)
00:05:57

[were able to replace the loop with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m01s)
00:06:01

[single call and so again that's just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m04s)
00:06:04

[refactoring doing exactly the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m07s)
00:06:07

[okay so then we looked at something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m14s)
00:06:14

[which was mainly designed to save some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m17s)
00:06:17

[training time which was previously we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m21s)
00:06:21

[had if we had a big piece of text right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m27s)
00:06:27

[so we've got like a movie review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m33s)
00:06:33

[but we were basically splitting it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m36s)
00:06:36

[into eight character segments and we'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m39s)
00:06:39

[grab like segment number one and use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m43s)
00:06:43

[that to predict the next character right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m46s)
00:06:46

[but in order to make sure that we kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m50s)
00:06:50

[of used all of the data we didn't just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m52s)
00:06:52

[put it up like that we actually said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m54s)
00:06:54

[like okay here's our whole thing let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h06m57s)
00:06:57

[grab the first will be to grab this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m01s)
00:07:01

[section the second will be to grab that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m03s)
00:07:03

[section in that section then that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m06s)
00:07:06

[section and each time would predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m08s)
00:07:08

[predicting the next one character a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m10s)
00:07:10

[okay and so you know I was bit concerned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m13s)
00:07:13

[that that seems pretty wasteful because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m17s)
00:07:17

[like as we calculate this section nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m19s)
00:07:19

[all of it overlaps with the previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m22s)
00:07:22

[section okay so instead what we did was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m24s)
00:07:24

[we said all right well what if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m28s)
00:07:28

[actually did split it into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m30s)
00:07:30

[non-overlapping pieces right and we said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m32s)
00:07:32

[all right let's grab this section here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m37s)
00:07:37

[and use it to predict every one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m41s)
00:07:41

[characters one along right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m46s)
00:07:46

[let's grab this section here and use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m49s)
00:07:49

[to predict every one of the characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m51s)
00:07:51

[went along so after we look at the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m53s)
00:07:53

[character in we try to predict the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m55s)
00:07:55

[second character and then now if we look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m57s)
00:07:57

[at the second character we try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[predict the third character and so okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m01s)
00:08:01

[and so that's where you've got to and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m03s)
00:08:03

[then what if you perceptive folks asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m05s)
00:08:05

[a really interesting question or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m08s)
00:08:08

[expressed their concern which was hey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m10s)
00:08:10

[after we got through the first the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[point here after we got through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m16s)
00:08:16

[first point here we kind of withdrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m22s)
00:08:22

[away our H activations and started a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m25s)
00:08:25

[one which meant that when it was trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m30s)
00:08:30

[to use character one to predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m32s)
00:08:32

[character - it's got nothing to go on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m36s)
00:08:36

[you know it hasn't built it's only built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m39s)
00:08:39

[it's only done one linear layer and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m41s)
00:08:41

[that seems like a problem which indeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m44s)
00:08:44

[it is okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m47s)
00:08:47

[so we're going to do the obvious thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m49s)
00:08:49

[which is let's not throw away H okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[let's not throw away that that matrix at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m54s)
00:08:54

[all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m58s)
00:08:58

[so in code the big problem is here but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h08m59s)
00:08:59

[every time we call forward so in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m04s)
00:09:04

[words every time we do a new mini-batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m06s)
00:09:06

[we're creating our our hidden state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m08s)
00:09:08

[right which remember is the orange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m12s)
00:09:12

[circles okay we're resetting it back to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m16s)
00:09:16

[a bunch of zeros and so as we go to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m18s)
00:09:18

[next non-overlapping section we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m21s)
00:09:21

[saying forget everything that's come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m23s)
00:09:23

[before but in fact the whole point is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m25s)
00:09:25

[know exactly where we are we're at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m28s)
00:09:28

[end of the previous section and about to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m30s)
00:09:30

[start the new next contiguous section so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m31s)
00:09:31

[let's not throw it away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m33s)
00:09:33

[so instead the idea would be to cut this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m34s)
00:09:34

[out right move it up to here okay store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[it away in self and then kind of keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[updating it right now so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[do that and there's going to be some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m51s)
00:09:51

[minor details to get right so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m54s)
00:09:54

[start by looking at the model so here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h09m58s)
00:09:58

[the model it's it's nearly identical and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m02s)
00:10:02

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m09s)
00:10:09

[here's the model it's nearly identical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m10s)
00:10:10

[but I've got as expected one more line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m12s)
00:10:12

[in my constructor where I call something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m15s)
00:10:15

[called init hidden and as expected in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m17s)
00:10:17

[hidden sets self dot H to be a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m20s)
00:10:20

[zeros okay so that's entirely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m26s)
00:10:26

[unsurprising and then as you can see our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m30s)
00:10:30

[R and n now takes in self garage and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m33s)
00:10:33

[as before spits out our new hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m39s)
00:10:39

[activations and so now the trick is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m42s)
00:10:42

[now store that away inside self dot H](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m45s)
00:10:45

[and so here's wrinkle number one if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m49s)
00:10:49

[think about it if I was to simply do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m53s)
00:10:53

[like like that right and now I train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h10m56s)
00:10:56

[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m02s)
00:11:02

[on a document that's I don't know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m02s)
00:11:02

[million words million characters long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m04s)
00:11:04

[then the size of this unrolled are a 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m08s)
00:11:08

[is has a million circles here and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m12s)
00:11:12

[that's fine going forwards right there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m18s)
00:11:18

[when I finally get to the end and I say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m21s)
00:11:21

[here's my character and actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m22s)
00:11:22

[remember we're doing multi output now so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m24s)
00:11:24

[multi output looks like this right or if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m26s)
00:11:26

[we were to draw the unrolled version of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m30s)
00:11:30

[multi output we would have a triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[coming off at every point okay so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m34s)
00:11:34

[problem is that then when we do back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m39s)
00:11:39

[propagation we're calculating you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m42s)
00:11:42

[how much does the error at character one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m44s)
00:11:44

[impact the final answer how much does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m49s)
00:11:49

[the error character to impact the final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m52s)
00:11:52

[answer and so forth and so we need to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m54s)
00:11:54

[back through and say like how do we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h11m56s)
00:11:56

[to update our weights based on all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m00s)
00:12:00

[those you know errors and so if there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m02s)
00:12:02

[are our million characters my unrolled R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m05s)
00:12:05

[and N is a million layers long I have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m09s)
00:12:09

[1 million layer fully connected Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m12s)
00:12:12

[all right and like I didn't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m15s)
00:12:15

[write the million layers because I have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m18s)
00:12:18

[for loop and the for loops hidden away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m19s)
00:12:19

[behind that you know the self dot R and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m21s)
00:12:21

[n but it's still there right we so so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m24s)
00:12:24

[this is actually a 1 million layer fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m28s)
00:12:28

[connected Network and so the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m31s)
00:12:31

[with that is it's going to be very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m33s)
00:12:33

[memory intensive because in order to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m34s)
00:12:34

[the chain rule I have to be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m37s)
00:12:37

[multiply at every step like you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m39s)
00:12:39

[after a few times she acts right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m42s)
00:12:42

[like I've got that means I have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m46s)
00:12:46

[remember that those values you the value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m48s)
00:12:48

[of every set of layers so I'm gonna have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m50s)
00:12:50

[to remember all those million layers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m53s)
00:12:53

[I'm going to do have to have to do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m54s)
00:12:54

[million multiplications and I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m56s)
00:12:56

[have to do that every batch okay so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h12m57s)
00:12:57

[would be bad so to avoid that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m01s)
00:13:01

[basically say all right well from time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m05s)
00:13:05

[to time I want you to forget your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m07s)
00:13:07

[history okay so we can still remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m10s)
00:13:10

[the state right which is to remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m13s)
00:13:13

[like what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[values in our hidden matrix right but we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m16s)
00:13:16

[can remember the state without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m19s)
00:13:19

[remembering everything about how we got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m23s)
00:13:23

[so there's a little function called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m23s)
00:13:23

[repackage variable which literally is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m27s)
00:13:27

[just this right it just simply says grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m35s)
00:13:35

[the tensor out of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m41s)
00:13:41

[right because remember the tensor itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m42s)
00:13:42

[doesn't have any concept of history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m44s)
00:13:44

[right and create a new variable out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m46s)
00:13:46

[that and so this variables going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m49s)
00:13:49

[the same value but no no history of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m51s)
00:13:51

[operations and therefore when it tries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m55s)
00:13:55

[to back propagate it all it'll stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m57s)
00:13:57

[there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h13m59s)
00:13:59

[so basically what we're going to do then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m00s)
00:14:00

[is we're going to call this in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m02s)
00:14:02

[forward so that means it's going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m05s)
00:14:05

[add characters it's going to back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m07s)
00:14:07

[propagate through eight layers it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m09s)
00:14:09

[going to keep track of the actual values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m13s)
00:14:13

[in our hidden state but it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m15s)
00:14:15

[throw away at the end of those eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m18s)
00:14:18

[it's its history of operations so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m20s)
00:14:20

[is this approach it's called back prop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m24s)
00:14:24

[through time and you know when you read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[about it online people make it sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m30s)
00:14:30

[like like a different algorithm or some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m32s)
00:14:32

[big insight or something but it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m36s)
00:14:36

[not at all right it's just saying hey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m38s)
00:14:38

[after our for loop you know just throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[away your your history operations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m43s)
00:14:43

[start afresh so we're keeping our hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m46s)
00:14:46

[state but we're not keeping our hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[States history okay so that's that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m50s)
00:14:50

[wrinkle number one that's what this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[repackage bar is doing and so what do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h14m58s)
00:14:58

[you see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m00s)
00:15:00

[BP BP TT that's referring to that crop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m01s)
00:15:01

[through time and you might remember we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[saw that in our original errand in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m07s)
00:15:07

[Lesson we had a variable called BP t t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m10s)
00:15:10

[equals 70 and so when we set that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[they're actually saying how many layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[backprop through another good reason not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m18s)
00:15:18

[to back crop through too many layers is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[if you have any kind of gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m23s)
00:15:23

[instability like gradient explosion or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m26s)
00:15:26

[gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m28s)
00:15:28

[banishing you know too many more of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m29s)
00:15:29

[more layers you have the harder the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m31s)
00:15:31

[network s to Train so smaller and less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m33s)
00:15:33

[resilient on the other hand and longer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m37s)
00:15:37

[value for VP TT means that you're able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m40s)
00:15:40

[to explicitly capture a longer kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[memory more state okay so that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m48s)
00:15:48

[that's something that you get to tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m53s)
00:15:53

[when you create your area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h15m55s)
00:15:55

[all right wrinkle number two is how are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[we going to put the data into this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m06s)
00:16:06

[like it's all very well the way I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[described it just now where we said you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m12s)
00:16:12

[know we could do this and we can first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m19s)
00:16:19

[of all look at this section then this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m24s)
00:16:24

[section in this section but we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[to do a mini batch at a time right we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m30s)
00:16:30

[want to do a bunch at a time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m33s)
00:16:33

[so in other words we want to say let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m35s)
00:16:35

[do it like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m43s)
00:16:43

[so mini-batch number one would say let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m50s)
00:16:50

[look at this section and predict that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m53s)
00:16:53

[section and at the same time in parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m56s)
00:16:56

[let's look at this totally different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h16m59s)
00:16:59

[section and predict this and at the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m01s)
00:17:01

[time in parallel let's look at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[totally different section and predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m06s)
00:17:06

[this right and so then because remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[in our in our hidden state we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m12s)
00:17:12

[vector of hidden state for everything in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m16s)
00:17:16

[our mini batch right so it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m18s)
00:17:18

[keep track of at the end of this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m20s)
00:17:20

[going to be a you know a vector here a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m22s)
00:17:22

[vector here a vector here and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m23s)
00:17:23

[can move across to the next one and say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m25s)
00:17:25

[okay so this part of the mini batch use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m28s)
00:17:28

[this to predict that and use this to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m31s)
00:17:31

[predict that and use this to predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m34s)
00:17:34

[that right so you can see that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m36s)
00:17:36

[moving that we've got like a number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m38s)
00:17:38

[totally separate bits of our text that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m40s)
00:17:40

[we're moving through in parallel right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m43s)
00:17:43

[so hopefully this is going to ring a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m46s)
00:17:46

[bells for you because what happened was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m48s)
00:17:48

[was back when we started looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m53s)
00:17:53

[torch texture the first time we started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m56s)
00:17:56

[talking about how it creates these mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h17m58s)
00:17:58

[batches and I said what happened was we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m00s)
00:18:00

[took our whole big long document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m03s)
00:18:03

[consisting of like you know the entire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m07s)
00:18:07

[works of nature or all of the IMDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m10s)
00:18:10

[reviews concatenated together or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[whatever and a lot of a lot of you not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m15s)
00:18:15

[surprisingly because this really said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m17s)
00:18:17

[this is really weird at first a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m19s)
00:18:19

[you didn't quite hear what I said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m20s)
00:18:20

[correctly what I said was we split this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m22s)
00:18:22

[into 64 equal sized chunks and a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m24s)
00:18:24

[your brains when Jeremy just said we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m29s)
00:18:29

[split this into chunks of size 64 but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[that's not what Theresa Jeremy said we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m35s)
00:18:35

[split it into 64 equal sized chunks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m37s)
00:18:37

[right so if this whole thing was length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m40s)
00:18:40

[64 million right which would be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m42s)
00:18:42

[reasonable sized corpus not an unusual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m45s)
00:18:45

[size corpus then each of our 64 chunks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m49s)
00:18:49

[would have been of length 1 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m51s)
00:18:51

[right and so then what we did was we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m55s)
00:18:55

[talked the first chunk of 1 million and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h18m58s)
00:18:58

[we put it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[and then we took the second chunk of 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[million and we put it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m04s)
00:19:04

[the third chunk of 1 million we put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m06s)
00:19:06

[here and so forth to create 64 chunks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m08s)
00:19:08

[and then H mini-batch consisted of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m13s)
00:19:13

[going let's split this down here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m18s)
00:19:18

[here and here and each of these is of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m22s)
00:19:22

[size BP te T which I think we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m27s)
00:19:27

[something like 70 right and so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[happened was we said alright let's look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[at our first mini batch is all of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m39s)
00:19:39

[right so we do all of those at once and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m42s)
00:19:42

[predict everything accrue off set by one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m45s)
00:19:45

[and then at the end of that first mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m49s)
00:19:49

[batch we went to the second chunk right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m53s)
00:19:53

[and used each one of these to predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m57s)
00:19:57

[the next one offset by one ok so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h19m58s)
00:19:58

[that's why we did that slightly weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m03s)
00:20:03

[thing right is that we wanted to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m06s)
00:20:06

[bunch of things we can look through in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m08s)
00:20:08

[parallel each of which like hopefully a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m10s)
00:20:10

[far enough away from each other you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m13s)
00:20:13

[that we don't have to worry about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m15s)
00:20:15

[fact that you know the truth is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m17s)
00:20:17

[starting the start of this million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m19s)
00:20:19

[characters was actually in the middle of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m21s)
00:20:21

[a sentence but you know who cares right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[because it's you know that only happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[once every million characters honey I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[was wondering if you could talk a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m33s)
00:20:33

[bit more about augmentation for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m36s)
00:20:36

[kind of data set and how to data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m38s)
00:20:38

[augmentation of this kind of data said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m41s)
00:20:41

[yeah no I can't because I don't I really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m42s)
00:20:42

[know a good way it's one of the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m46s)
00:20:46

[I'm going to be studying between now and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[part two there have been some recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m52s)
00:20:52

[developments particularly something we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m55s)
00:20:55

[talked about the machine learning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h20m58s)
00:20:58

[and I think we've refinished in here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m00s)
00:21:00

[which was somebody for a recent careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m01s)

00:21:06

[of different rows basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m12s)
00:21:12

[something like that may be useful here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[and I've seen it I've seen some papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m18s)
00:21:18

[that do something like that but yeah I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m20s)
00:21:20

[haven't seen any kind of recent ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m23s)

[NLP papers that that are doing this kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m28s)
00:21:28

[of data orientation so it's something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m32s)
00:21:32

[we're planning to work on so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m33s)
00:21:33

[generally how the issues be PTT so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m39s)
00:21:39

[there's a couple of things to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m47s)
00:21:47

[about when you pick your be PTT the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m48s)
00:21:48

[first is that you'll note that the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m49s)
00:21:49

[matrix size for a mini batch has a B PTT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m52s)
00:21:52

[the the TT by batch size so one issue is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h21m57s)
00:21:57

[your GPU Ram needs to be able to fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m08s)
00:22:08

[that by your embedding matrix racks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m11s)
00:22:11

[every one of these is going to have B of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m14s)
00:22:14

[length embedding length plus all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m17s)
00:22:17

[hidden state so one thing is to you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m20s)
00:22:20

[if you get a cruder out of memory error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m23s)
00:22:23

[you need to reduce one of those if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m25s)
00:22:25

[you're finding your training is very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m29s)
00:22:29

[unstable like your loss is shooting off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m33s)
00:22:33

[to LAN suddenly then you could try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m35s)
00:22:35

[decreasing your B PTT because you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m38s)
00:22:38

[less layers to gradient explode through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m40s)
00:22:40

[it's too slow you could try decreasing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m43s)
00:22:43

[your B PTT because it's going to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m47s)
00:22:47

[do one of those steps at a time like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m49s)
00:22:49

[that for loop can't be paralyzed well I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m51s)
00:22:51

[say that there's a recent thing called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h22m57s)
00:22:57

[QR an N which is will hopefully talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m00s)
00:23:00

[about in part two which kind of does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m03s)
00:23:03

[paralyze it but the versions we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m04s)
00:23:04

[looking at don't paralyze it so there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m05s)
00:23:05

[would be the main issues I think before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m08s)
00:23:08

[look at performance look at memory and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m09s)
00:23:09

[look at stability and try and find a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m12s)
00:23:12

[number that's you know as high as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m14s)
00:23:14

[can make it but all of those things work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m17s)
00:23:17

[for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m19s)
00:23:19

[okay so trying to get although that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m23s)
00:23:23

[chunking and lining up and anything to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m29s)
00:23:29

[work is more code than I want to write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m31s)
00:23:31

[so for this section we're going to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m33s)
00:23:33

[back and use torched s together okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m35s)
00:23:35

[so when you're using AP is like fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m37s)
00:23:37

[and torch text which in these case these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m44s)
00:23:44

[two API is a desire to or at least from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m46s)
00:23:46

[the first day I site designed to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m48s)
00:23:48

[together you often have a choice which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m50s)
00:23:50

[is like okay this API has a number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m52s)
00:23:52

[methods that expect the data in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m55s)
00:23:55

[kind of format and you can either change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h23m58s)
00:23:58

[your data to fit that format or you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m01s)
00:24:01

[write your own data set subclass to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m03s)
00:24:03

[handle the format that your data is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m07s)
00:24:07

[already in I've noticed on the forum a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m08s)
00:24:08

[lot of you are spending a lot of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m12s)
00:24:12

[writing your own dataset classes whereas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m14s)
00:24:14

[I am way lazier than you and I spend my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m17s)
00:24:17

[time instead changing my data to fit the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m20s)
00:24:20

[data set classes I have like I that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m23s)
00:24:23

[fine and if you realize like oh there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m27s)
00:24:27

[a kind of a format of data that me and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m31s)
00:24:31

[other people are likely to be seen quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m34s)
00:24:34

[often and it's not in the first day our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m36s)
00:24:36

[library then by all means write the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m37s)
00:24:37

[set subclass it submitted as a PR and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m40s)
00:24:40

[then everybody can benefit you know but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m42s)
00:24:42

[in this case I just kind of thought I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m45s)
00:24:45

[want to have some Nietzsche data fed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m48s)
00:24:48

[into torch text I'm just going to put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m52s)
00:24:52

[in the format that watch text kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m55s)
00:24:55

[already support so torch text already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h24m57s)
00:24:57

[has or at least the first day I wrap her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m00s)
00:25:00

[around Twitter text already has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m02s)
00:25:02

[something where you can have a training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m04s)
00:25:04

[path and a validation path and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m05s)
00:25:05

[one or more text files in each path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m09s)
00:25:09

[containing a bunch of stuff that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m11s)
00:25:11

[concatenated together for your language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m12s)
00:25:12

[model so in this case all I did was I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m14s)
00:25:14

[made a copy of my nature file copied it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m17s)
00:25:17

[into training made another copy stuck it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[into the validation and then in one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m23s)
00:25:23

[the you know in the training set I did I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m26s)
00:25:26

[deleted the last twenty percent of rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m29s)
00:25:29

[and in the validation set I deleted all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m32s)
00:25:32

[except for the last one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m34s)
00:25:34

[Center for us and I was done right so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m35s)
00:25:35

[found this that in this case I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[that easier than writing a custom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m40s)
00:25:40

[dataset class the other benefit of doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m43s)
00:25:43

[it that way was that I felt like it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m45s)
00:25:45

[more realistic to have a validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m47s)
00:25:47

[that wasn't a random shuffled set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[rows of text that was like a totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m53s)
00:25:53

[separate part of the corpus because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m56s)
00:25:56

[feel like in practice you're very often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h25m59s)
00:25:59

[going to be saying like oh I've got I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m01s)
00:26:01

[don't know these books or these authors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m02s)
00:26:02

[I'm learning from and then I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m05s)
00:26:05

[apply it to these different books and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m07s)
00:26:07

[these different authors you know so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m08s)
00:26:08

[felt like for getting a more realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m10s)
00:26:10

[validation of my nietzsche model I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m13s)
00:26:13

[should use like a whole separate piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[of the text so in this case it's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m18s)
00:26:18

[last you know 20% of the rows if the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m20s)
00:26:20

[corpus so I haven't created this for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m23s)
00:26:23

[right intentionally because you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m28s)
00:26:28

[this is the kind of stuff I want to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m31s)
00:26:31

[practicing is making sure that you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m32s)
00:26:32

[familiar enough comfortable enough with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m35s)
00:26:35

[with batch or whatever that you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m36s)
00:26:36

[create these and that you understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m38s)
00:26:38

[what they need to look like and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m40s)
00:26:40

[so in this case you can see I've now got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m42s)
00:26:42

[you know a train and a validation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m48s)
00:26:48

[and then I could yeah okay so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m51s)
00:26:51

[see I've literally just got one file in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m57s)
00:26:57

[it because it's a fire when you're doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h26m59s)
00:26:59

[a language model ie predicting the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m00s)
00:27:00

[character or predicting the next word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m02s)
00:27:02

[you don't really need separate files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m04s)
00:27:04

[it's fine if you do have separate files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m07s)
00:27:07

[but they just get capped native together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m09s)
00:27:09

[anyway alright so that's my source data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m11s)
00:27:11

[and so here is you know the same lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m15s)
00:27:15

[of code that we've seen before and let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m19s)
00:27:19

[go over them again so it's a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m20s)
00:27:20

[lessons ago right so in torch text we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m22s)
00:27:22

[create this thing called a field and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m25s)
00:27:25

[field initially is just a description of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m28s)
00:27:28

[how to go about pre-processing the test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m31s)
00:27:31

[okay now you in this case I'm gonna say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m36s)
00:27:36

[hey lowercase it you know cuz I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m38s)
00:27:38

[mean now I think about it there's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m41s)
00:27:41

[particular reason to have done this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m44s)
00:27:44

[lower case upper case would work fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m45s)
00:27:45

[too and then how do I talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m46s)
00:27:46

[maser and so you might remember last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m49s)
00:27:49

[time we used a tokenization function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m50s)
00:27:50

[which kind of largely spit on white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m53s)
00:27:53

[space and try to do some flavor things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m56s)
00:27:56

[with punctuation right and that gave us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m57s)
00:27:57

[a word model in this case I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h27m59s)
00:27:59

[character model so I actually want every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m02s)
00:28:02

[character put into a separate token so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[could just use the function list in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m07s)
00:28:07

[Python because list in Python does that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m10s)
00:28:10

[okay so this is where you can kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m16s)
00:28:16

[see like understanding how libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[like torch text and fast ar e are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m23s)
00:28:23

[designed to be extended can make your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m25s)
00:28:25

[life a lot easier right so when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m27s)
00:28:27

[realize that very often both of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m30s)
00:28:30

[libraries kind of expect you to pass a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m33s)
00:28:33

[function that does something and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m35s)
00:28:35

[you realize like oh I can write any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m38s)
00:28:38

[function I like all right okay so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m40s)
00:28:40

[is now going to mean that each mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m44s)
00:28:44

[batch is going to contain a list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m47s)
00:28:47

[characters and so here's where we get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m49s)
00:28:49

[define all our different parameters and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m52s)
00:28:52

[so to make it the same as previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m55s)
00:28:55

[sections of this notebook I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h28m58s)
00:28:58

[use the same batch size the same number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m00s)
00:29:00

[of characters then they're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m03s)
00:29:03

[rename it to their PT t since we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m04s)
00:29:04

[what that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m06s)
00:29:06

[the number of the size of the embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[and the size of our hidden state okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m12s)
00:29:12

[remembering that size of our hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m14s)
00:29:14

[state simply means going all the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m16s)
00:29:16

[back to the start right and hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m21s)
00:29:21

[simply means the size of the state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m25s)
00:29:25

[that's created by each of those orange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[arrows so it's the size of each of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m29s)
00:29:29

[circles yeah okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m31s)
00:29:31

[so having done that we can then create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m38s)
00:29:38

[little dictionary saying what's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m40s)
00:29:40

[training validation and test set in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[case I don't have a separate test set so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[I just use the same thing and then I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m46s)
00:29:46

[say all right I want a language model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m50s)
00:29:50

[data subclass with model data I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m51s)
00:29:51

[to grab it from text files and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m55s)
00:29:55

[my path and this is my field which I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h29m58s)
00:29:58

[defined earlier and these are my files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m03s)
00:30:03

[and these are my hyper parameters min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m06s)
00:30:06

[fracks not going to do anything actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m11s)
00:30:11

[in this case because there's not I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m12s)
00:30:12

[think there's going to be any character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[that appears less than three times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m15s)
00:30:15

[that's probably redundant okay so at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[end of that it says there's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m22s)
00:30:22

[963 batches to go through and so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m24s)
00:30:24

[think about it that should be equal to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m29s)
00:30:29

[the number of tokens divided by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m31s)
00:30:31

[batch size divided by B PTT because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m35s)
00:30:35

[that's like the size of each of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m38s)
00:30:38

[rectangles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m40s)
00:30:40

[you'll find that in practice it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m45s)
00:30:45

[exactly that and the reason it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m47s)
00:30:47

[exactly that is that the authors of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m49s)
00:30:49

[torch text did something pretty smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m52s)
00:30:52

[which I think we've briefly mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m56s)
00:30:56

[this before they said okay we can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m57s)
00:30:57

[shuffle the data like with images we'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h30m59s)
00:30:59

[like to shuffle the order so every time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m02s)
00:31:02

[we see them in a different order so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m03s)
00:31:03

[there's a bit more random listed we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m04s)
00:31:04

[can't shuffle because we need to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m06s)
00:31:06

[contiguous but what we could do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m08s)
00:31:08

[randomize the length of you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m11s)
00:31:11

[basically randomize be PTT a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m13s)
00:31:13

[each time and so that's what PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m16s)
00:31:16

[does it's not always going to give us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m19s)
00:31:19

[exactly 8 characters long 5% of the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m21s)
00:31:21

[it'll actually cut it enough and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m26s)
00:31:26

[it's going to add on a small little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m30s)
00:31:30

[standard deviation you know to make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m32s)
00:31:32

[slightly bigger or smaller than for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m35s)
00:31:35

[white okay so it's going to be slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m36s)
00:31:36

[different to eight on average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m38s)
00:31:38

[yes just to make sure is it going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m45s)
00:31:45

[constant per Vinny watch yeah yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m50s)
00:31:50

[exactly that's right so a mini batch you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m53s)
00:31:53

[know has to kind of it needs to do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h31m57s)
00:31:57

[matrix multiplication and the mini batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m01s)
00:32:01

[size has to remain constant because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m06s)
00:32:06

[we've got this age weight matrix that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m09s)
00:32:09

[has to you know has to line up in size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m14s)
00:32:14

[with the size of the mini batch yeah but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m16s)
00:32:16

[the number you know the sequence length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m20s)
00:32:20

[can can change their problem okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m23s)
00:32:23

[that's why we have 963 that's so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m33s)
00:32:33

[length of a data loader is how many mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m36s)
00:32:36

[batches in this case it's so do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m37s)
00:32:37

[approximate okay number of tokens is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m39s)
00:32:39

[many unique things are in the vocabulary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m42s)
00:32:42

[and remember after we run this line text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m45s)
00:32:45

[now does not just contain in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m51s)
00:32:51

[description of what we want but it also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m54s)
00:32:54

[contains an extra attribute called vocab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h32m56s)
00:32:56

[right which contains stuff like a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m01s)
00:33:01

[of all of the unique items in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m06s)
00:33:06

[vocabulary and a reverse mapping from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m10s)
00:33:10

[each item to its number okay so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m14s)
00:33:14

[text object is now an important thing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m19s)
00:33:19

[keep out all right so let's now try this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m23s)
00:33:23

[so we do we started out by looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m31s)
00:33:31

[the class so the class is exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m34s)
00:33:34

[same as the class we've had before the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m36s)
00:33:36

[only key difference is to call in at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[hidden which calls sets out so H is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m41s)
00:33:41

[a variable anymore it's now an attribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m44s)
00:33:44

[itself that H is a variable containing a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m46s)
00:33:46

[bunch of zeros now I've been shown that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m50s)
00:33:50

[that size remains constant H time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m54s)
00:33:54

[but unfortunately when I said that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h33m58s)
00:33:58

[lied to you and the way that I lied to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m00s)
00:34:00

[you is that the very last mini batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m03s)
00:34:03

[will be shorter okay the very last mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m07s)
00:34:07

[batch is actually going to have less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m10s)
00:34:10

[than 60 well it might be exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m12s)
00:34:12

[right size if it so happens that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m14s)
00:34:14

[data set is exactly divisible by B PTT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m16s)
00:34:16

[times patch size but it probably isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m19s)
00:34:19

[so the last batch will probably has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m21s)
00:34:21

[little bit less okay and so that's why I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m23s)
00:34:23

[do a little check here that says let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m27s)
00:34:27

[check that the batch size inside self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m29s)
00:34:29

[dot H right and so self dot H is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m31s)
00:34:31

[to be the height sorry the height is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m35s)
00:34:35

[going to be the number of activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m40s)
00:34:40

[and the width is going to be the mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m44s)
00:34:44

[batch size okay check that that's equal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m46s)
00:34:46

[to the actual sequence length sorry the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m49s)
00:34:49

[actual batch size length that we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m54s)
00:34:54

[received okay and if they're not the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m56s)
00:34:56

[same then set it back to 0 's again okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h34m58s)
00:34:58

[so this is just a minor little wrinkle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m02s)
00:35:02

[that basically at the end of each epoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m05s)
00:35:05

[it's going to do like a little mini mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m07s)
00:35:07

[batch right and so then as soon as it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m10s)
00:35:10

[starts the next epoch it's going to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m13s)
00:35:13

[that they're not the same again and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m15s)
00:35:15

[it'll reinitialize it to the correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m17s)
00:35:17

[full batch size okay so that's why you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m19s)
00:35:19

[know if you're wondering there's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m21s)
00:35:21

[inert hidden not just in the constructor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m23s)
00:35:23

[but also inside forward it's to handle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m25s)
00:35:25

[this kind of end of each epoch start of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m28s)
00:35:28

[each epoch difference okay not an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m31s)
00:35:31

[important point by any means but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m34s)
00:35:34

[potentially confusing when you see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m36s)
00:35:36

[okay so the last wrinkle the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m39s)
00:35:39

[wrinkle is something which i think is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m47s)
00:35:47

[something that slightly sucks about pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m51s)
00:35:51

[torch and maybe somebody can be nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m53s)
00:35:53

[enough to try and fix it with a PR if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m55s)
00:35:55

[anybody feels like it which is that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m57s)
00:35:57

[loss functions such as softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[I'm not happy receiving a rank 3 tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m04s)
00:36:04

[remember a rank 3 tensor is just another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m09s)
00:36:09

[way of saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m11s)
00:36:11

[dimension three right okay there's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m12s)
00:36:12

[particular reason they ought to not be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m17s)
00:36:17

[happy receiving a rank 3 tensor you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m18s)
00:36:18

[like somebody could write some code to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m21s)
00:36:21

[say hey a wreck three tensor is probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m22s)
00:36:22

[you know a sequence length by batch size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m24s)
00:36:24

[by you know results thing and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m27s)
00:36:27

[should just do it for each of the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[initial axis but no one's done that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m35s)
00:36:35

[so it expects it to be a rank two tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m39s)
00:36:39

[funnily enough it can handle write to or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m43s)
00:36:43

[rec for they're not right through yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m45s)
00:36:45

[so we've got so we've got a rank two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h36m48s)
00:36:48

[tensor containing you know for each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m00s)
00:37:00

[period I can't remember which way around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m04s)
00:37:04

[the the y axes are but whatever for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m08s)
00:37:08

[time period for each batch we've got our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m11s)
00:37:11

[predictions okay and then we've got our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m17s)
00:37:17

[our actuals for each time period for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m21s)
00:37:21

[each batch we've got our predictions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m27s)
00:37:27

[we've got our actuals okay and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m31s)
00:37:31

[just want to check whether they're the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m34s)
00:37:34

[same and so at an ideal world our lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m35s)
00:37:35

[function a loss function would check you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m37s)
00:37:37

[know item 1 1 then item 1 2 and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m39s)
00:37:39

[item 1 3 but since that hasn't been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m42s)
00:37:42

[written we just have to flatten them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m44s)
00:37:44

[both out okay and we can literally just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m46s)
00:37:46

[flatten them out put rose - rose and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m48s)
00:37:48

[that's why here I have to use dot view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[okay and so dot view says the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h37m57s)
00:37:57

[columns will be equal to the size of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m04s)
00:38:04

[vocab because remember we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[end up with a prediction you know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m07s)
00:38:07

[probability for each letter and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m08s)
00:38:08

[number of rows is however big is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m11s)
00:38:11

[necessary which will be equal to batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m14s)
00:38:14

[size times B PTT okay and then you may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m15s)
00:38:15

[be wondering where I do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m24s)
00:38:24

[that's so that's where the predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[you may be wondering where I do that for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m27s)
00:38:27

[the target and the answer is torch text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m28s)
00:38:28

[knows that the target needs to look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m31s)
00:38:31

[that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m32s)
00:38:32

[so torch text has already done that for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m33s)
00:38:33

[us okay so torch text automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m34s)
00:38:34

[changes the target to be flattened out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m36s)
00:38:36

[as you might actually remember if you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m39s)
00:38:39

[back to lesson 4 when we actually looked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m41s)
00:38:41

[at a mini batch that's bad out of torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m45s)
00:38:45

[text we did we noticed actually that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m48s)
00:38:48

[was flattened and I said we'll learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m50s)
00:38:50

[about why later and so later is now all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m52s)
00:38:52

[right okay so they're the three wrinkles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h38m55s)
00:38:55

[get rid of the history ooh I guess for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m00s)
00:39:00

[wrinkles recreate the hidden state if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m06s)
00:39:06

[the batch size changes flatten out and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m11s)
00:39:11

[then you just torch text to create mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m16s)
00:39:16

[batches that line up nicely so once we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m19s)
00:39:19

[do those things we can then create our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m23s)
00:39:23

[model create our optimizer with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m26s)
00:39:26

[models parameters and fit it one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m30s)
00:39:30

[to be careful of here is that softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m38s)
00:39:38

[now as of hi torch 0.3 requires that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m48s)
00:39:48

[pass in a number here saying which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m55s)
00:39:55

[access do we want to do the softmax over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h39m59s)
00:39:59

[so at this point this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m02s)
00:40:02

[three-dimensional tensor right and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m05s)
00:40:05

[want to do the softmax over the final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m08s)
00:40:08

[axis right so when i say which axis do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m10s)
00:40:10

[we do the softmax over remember we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m13s)
00:40:13

[divide by there we go e to the X I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m15s)
00:40:15

[divided by the sum of e to the X I so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m18s)
00:40:18

[it's saying which axis do we sum over so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m21s)
00:40:21

[which access we want to sum to one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m24s)
00:40:24

[so in this case clearly we want to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m26s)
00:40:26

[over the last axis because the last axis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[is the one that contains the probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m31s)
00:40:31

[per letter of the alphabet and we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[all of those probabilities to sum to one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m37s)
00:40:37

[so therefore to run this notebook you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m40s)
00:40:40

[going to need PI torch 0.3 which just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m45s)
00:40:45

[came out this week ok so if you're doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m48s)
00:40:48

[this on the milk you're fine I'm sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m50s)
00:40:50

[you've got at least a 0.3 or later ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m51s)
00:40:51

[where else the students here if you just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m54s)
00:40:54

[go Conda and update it will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m56s)
00:40:56

[automatically update you to 0.3 the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h40m58s)
00:40:58

[really great news is that 0.3 although](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h41m02s)
00:41:02

[it does not yet officially support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h41m06s)
00:41:06

[windows it does in practice I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h41m08s)
00:41:08

[successfully installed 0.3 from Condor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h41m11s)
00:41:11

[yesterday by typing Condor install torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h41m14s)
00:41:14

[PI torch in Windows are then attempted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h41m16s)
00:41:16

[to use the entirety of lesson 1 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h41m19s)
00:41:19

[every single part worked so I actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h41m21s)
00:41:21

[ran it on this very laptop so for those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h41m24s)
00:41:24

[boss also I successfully installed Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m09s)
00:42:09

[on eart and all of the faster I staff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m13s)
00:42:13

[worked on Linux as well so really good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[option if you're interested in a laptop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m18s)
00:42:18

[that can run deep learning stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m22s)
00:42:22

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m25s)
00:42:25

[alright so that's that's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m26s)
00:42:26

[aware of with this team equals minus 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[so then we can go ahead and construct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m30s)
00:42:30

[this and we can call fit and yeah we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[basically going to get pretty similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[results to what we got the ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m39s)
00:42:39

[alright so then we can go a bit further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m43s)
00:42:43

[without RNN by just kind of unpacking it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m49s)
00:42:49

[a bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m52s)
00:42:52

[and so this is now again exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m53s)
00:42:53

[same thing gives exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m55s)
00:42:55

[answers but I have removed the cold air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h42m57s)
00:42:57

[in it so I've got rid of this self to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[iron in okay and so this is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m05s)
00:43:05

[something I won't spend time on it but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m09s)
00:43:09

[you can check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[so instead I've now to find iron in as R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m11s)
00:43:11

[and n cell and I've copied and pasted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m14s)
00:43:14

[the code above don't run it this is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m17s)
00:43:17

[for your reference from PI torch this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m19s)
00:43:19

[this is the color the definition of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[eridan so in PI torch and I want you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[see that you can now read PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m26s)
00:43:26

[source code and understand it not only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m29s)
00:43:29

[that you'll recognize it as being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m32s)
00:43:32

[something we've done before it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m33s)
00:43:33

[matrix modification of the weights by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m35s)
00:43:35

[the inputs plus biases so f dot linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m38s)
00:43:38

[simply does a matrix product followed by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m42s)
00:43:42

[an addition right and interestingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[you'll see they do not concatenate the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m47s)
00:43:47

[the input bit and the hidden bit they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m51s)
00:43:51

[sum them together which is our first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m55s)
00:43:55

[approach and I'm as I said you can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h43m58s)
00:43:58

[either neither one's right or wrong but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m00s)
00:44:00

[it's interesting to see this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m02s)
00:44:02

[definition yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m03s)
00:44:03

[yes you know can give some insight about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[what are they using that particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[activation function firm yeah yeah I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m12s)
00:44:12

[think you might have briefly covered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m18s)
00:44:18

[this last week but very happy to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m20s)
00:44:20

[again if I did basically fan that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m22s)
00:44:22

[positive 1 and negative 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m28s)
00:44:28

[then looks like that so in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m36s)
00:44:36

[it's a sigmoid function double the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m39s)
00:44:39

[height minus one naturally they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m42s)
00:44:42

[they're equal so it's it's it's a nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m45s)
00:44:45

[function in that it's forcing it to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m49s)
00:44:49

[you know no smaller than minus one no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m53s)
00:44:53

[bigger than plus one and since we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[multiplying by this white matrix again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[and again and again and again we might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h44m59s)
00:44:59

[worry that our Lu because it's unbounded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m03s)
00:45:03

[might have more of a gradient explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m05s)
00:45:05

[problem that's basically the theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m08s)
00:45:08

[having said that you can actually ask pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m11s)
00:45:11

[torch for an RNN cell which uses a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m19s)
00:45:19

[different non-linearity so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m24s)
00:45:24

[by default it uses then you can ask for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m26s)
00:45:26

[a value as well but yeah most people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m28s)
00:45:28

[seem to pretty much everybody still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m31s)
00:45:31

[seems to use them as far as I can tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m32s)
00:45:32

[so you can basically see here this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m36s)
00:45:36

[all the same except now I've got an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m38s)
00:45:38

[errand in cell which means now I need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m40s)
00:45:40

[put my for loop back alright and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m41s)
00:45:41

[see every time I call my my little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m44s)
00:45:44

[linear function I just obtained the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m48s)
00:45:48

[result onto my list okay and at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m51s)
00:45:51

[the result is that all stacked up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m54s)
00:45:54

[together okay so like just trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h45m57s)
00:45:57

[show you how nothing inside PI torches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m00s)
00:46:00

[is mysterious right you should find you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m04s)
00:46:04

[get basically the fact you I found I got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m06s)
00:46:06

[exactly the same answer from this as the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m08s)
00:46:08

[previous one okay in practice you would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m11s)
00:46:11

[never write it like this but what you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m14s)
00:46:14

[may well find in practice is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m15s)
00:46:15

[somebody will come up with like a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[kind of eridan cell or a different way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m19s)
00:46:19

[of kind of keeping track of things over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m22s)
00:46:22

[time or a different way of doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m24s)
00:46:24

[regularization and so inside posterize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m25s)
00:46:25

[code you will find that we we do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[exactly this basically we have this by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m34s)
00:46:34

[hand because we use some regularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m37s)
00:46:37

[approaches that are supported by pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m39s)
00:46:39

[torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m41s)
00:46:41

[all right so then another thing I'm not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m43s)
00:46:43

[going to spend much time on but I'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m46s)
00:46:46

[mention briefly is that nobody really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m47s)
00:46:47

[uses this hour an insult in practice and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m50s)
00:46:50

[the reason we don't use that eridan so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m54s)
00:46:54

[in practice is even though the fan is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m56s)
00:46:56

[here you do tend to find gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h46m58s)
00:46:58

[explosions are still a problem and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m03s)
00:47:03

[have to use pretty low learning rates to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m05s)
00:47:05

[get these to train and pretty small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m08s)
00:47:08

[values for B PTT to get them to Train so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m10s)
00:47:10

[what we do instead is we replace the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m15s)
00:47:15

[eridan cell with something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m17s)
00:47:17

[this is called a GI u cell and a GI u so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m20s)
00:47:20

[here it is has a picture of it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m29s)
00:47:29

[there's the equations for it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m35s)
00:47:35

[basically I'll show you both quickly but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m38s)
00:47:38

[we'll talk about it much more in part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m41s)
00:47:41

[two we've got our input okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m42s)
00:47:42

[and our input normally goes straight in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m47s)
00:47:47

[gets multiplied by a weight matrix to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m51s)
00:47:51

[create our new activations that's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h47m56s)
00:47:56

[what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m00s)
00:48:00

[and then we've cost we also we add it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m02s)
00:48:02

[the existing activations that's not what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m04s)
00:48:04

[happens here in this case our input goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m06s)
00:48:06

[into this H tilde temporary thing and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m10s)
00:48:10

[doesn't just get added to our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m14s)
00:48:14

[activations their previous activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m16s)
00:48:16

[that our previous activations get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m18s)
00:48:18

[multiplied by this value R and R stands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m20s)
00:48:20

[for reset it's a reset gate okay and how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m24s)
00:48:24

[do we calculate that this this value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m29s)
00:48:29

[goes between Norton one right in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m31s)
00:48:31

[reset gate well the answer is it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m33s)
00:48:33

[simply equal to a matrix product between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m36s)
00:48:36

[some weight matrix and the concatenation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m40s)
00:48:40

[of our previous hidden state and our new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m43s)
00:48:43

[input in other words this is a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m46s)
00:48:46

[one hidden layer neural net and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m49s)
00:48:49

[particular it's a one hidden layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m53s)
00:48:53

[neural net because we're then put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m54s)
00:48:54

[through the sigmoid function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m56s)
00:48:56

[when you seasick but one of the things I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m57s)
00:48:57

[hate about mathematical notation is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h48m59s)
00:48:59

[symbols are overloaded a lot right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m00s)
00:49:00

[sometimes when you see Sigma that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m03s)

[standard deviation when you see it next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m05s)
00:49:05

[to a parenthesis like this it means the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m07s)
00:49:07

[sigmoid function okay so in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m09s)
00:49:09

[that okay which looks like that okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m16s)
00:49:16

[this is like a little mini neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m26s)
00:49:26

[with no hidden layers or to think of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m28s)
00:49:28

[another way it's like a little logistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m29s)
00:49:29

[regression okay and this is I mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m30s)
00:49:30

[this briefly because it's going to come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m34s)
00:49:34

[up a lot in part two and so it's a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m35s)
00:49:35

[thing to like start learning about it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m37s)
00:49:37

[this idea that like in the very learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m39s)
00:49:39

[itself you can have like little mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m43s)
00:49:43

[neural nets inside your neural nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m45s)
00:49:45

[right and so this little mini neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m47s)
00:49:47

[is going to be used to decide how much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m50s)
00:49:50

[of my hidden state am I going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[remember right and so it might learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m56s)
00:49:56

[that Oh in this particular situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h49m58s)
00:49:58

[forget everything you know for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m00s)
00:50:00

[oh there's a full-stop you know hey when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[you see a full-stop you should throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m05s)
00:50:05

[away nearly all of your hidden state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m07s)
00:50:07

[that is probably something it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m09s)
00:50:09

[learn and that that's very easy for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m11s)
00:50:11

[to learn using this little mini neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m12s)
00:50:12

[there okay and so that goes through to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m14s)
00:50:14

[create my new hidden state along with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m17s)
00:50:17

[the input and then there's a second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m20s)
00:50:20

[thing that happens which is there's this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m22s)
00:50:22

[gate here called Z and what Z says is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m24s)
00:50:24

[all right you've got your some amount of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m28s)
00:50:28

[your previous hidden state plus your new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m31s)
00:50:31

[input right and it's going to go through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m34s)
00:50:34

[to create your new state and I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m36s)
00:50:36

[to let you decide to what degree do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m39s)
00:50:39

[use this new input version of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m41s)
00:50:41

[hidden state and to what degree where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m45s)
00:50:45

[you just leave the hidden state the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m47s)
00:50:47

[as before so this thing here is called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m49s)
00:50:49

[the update gate right and so it's got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m50s)
00:50:50

[two choices it can make the first-years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m53s)
00:50:53

[to throw away some hidden state when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m55s)
00:50:55

[deciding how much to incorporate that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m57s)
00:50:57

[versus my new input and how much to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h50m59s)
00:50:59

[update my hidden state versus just leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m02s)
00:51:02

[it exactly the same and the equation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m05s)
00:51:05

[hopefully is going to look pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m10s)

[to you which is check this out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m11s)
00:51:11

[remember how I said you want to start to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m14s)
00:51:14

[recognize some some common ways of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m16s)
00:51:16

[looking at things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m19s)
00:51:19

[well here I have a 1 - something by a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[thing and a something without the 1 - by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m25s)
00:51:25

[a thing which remember is a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m30s)
00:51:30

[interpolation right so in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m33s)
00:51:33

[the value of Z is going to decide to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m35s)
00:51:35

[what degree do I have keep the previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m39s)
00:51:39

[hidden state and to what degree do I use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m43s)
00:51:43

[the new hidden state right so that's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m46s)
00:51:46

[they draw it here as this kind of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m49s)
00:51:49

[it's not actually a switch but like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m52s)
00:51:52

[can put it in any position you can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m55s)
00:51:55

[like oh it's here or it's here or it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m57s)
00:51:57

[here to decide how much that'll do ok so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h51m59s)
00:51:59

[so they're basically the equations it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m03s)
00:52:03

[a it's a little mini neural net with its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m06s)

[reset and then that's used to do an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m13s)
00:52:13

[interpolation between the two hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m15s)
00:52:15

[states so that's called giu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m17s)
00:52:17

[gated recurrent Network there's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m21s)

[definition from the PI torch source code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m24s)
00:52:24

[they have some slight optimizations here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m27s)
00:52:27

[that if you're interested in we can talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m31s)
00:52:31

[about them on the forum but it's exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m32s)
00:52:32

[the same for we just saw and so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m35s)
00:52:35

[go and NDI you that it uses this same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m39s)
00:52:39

[code but it replaces the iron in so with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m43s)
00:52:43

[this cell okay and as a result rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m47s)
00:52:47

[than having something where we needed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m51s)
00:52:51

[where we were getting a 1.54 we're now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h52m53s)

[keep training even more get right down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h53m02s)
00:53:02

[to one point three six okay so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h53m03s)
00:53:03

[practice a giu or very nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h53m05s)

[HT are ultimately scalars after they go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h53m18s)
00:53:18

[through the sigmoid but there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h53m22s)

[same size as the hidden state but you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h54m34s)
00:54:34

[just have to return the tupple okay the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h54m37s)
00:54:37

[details don't matter too much but we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h54m40s)
00:54:40

[talk about it during the week if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h54m43s)

[new value of H is to repackage it in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h54m50s)
00:54:50

[usual way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h54m53s)
00:54:53

[so this code is identical to the code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h54m53s)
00:54:53

[before one thing I've done though is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h54m55s)
00:54:55

[I've had a drop out inside my air and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h54m58s)
00:54:58

[which you can do with the height watch R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m02s)
00:55:02

[and n function so that's going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m05s)
00:55:05

[drop out after a time step and I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m07s)
00:55:07

[doubled the size of my hidden layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m09s)
00:55:09

[since I've now added point five drop out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m11s)
00:55:11

[and so my hope was that this would make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m13s)
00:55:13

[it be able to learn more but be more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m15s)

[without without using the learner class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m44s)
00:55:44

[ok so to do that we create our model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m46s)
00:55:46

[again just a standard PI torch model ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[and this time rather than going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[remember the usual pipe torch approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m54s)
00:55:54

[is opt equals up to M naught atom and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h55m56s)
00:55:56

[you pass in the parameters and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m00s)
00:56:00

[learning rate I'm not going to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m01s)
00:56:01

[I'm going to use the fast AI layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m03s)
00:56:03

[optimizer class which takes my opt-in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m06s)
00:56:06

[class constructor from PI torch it takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m12s)
00:56:12

[my model it takes my learning rate and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m16s)
00:56:16

[optionally takes weight decay ok and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m20s)
00:56:20

[this class is tiny it doesn't do very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m25s)
00:56:25

[much at all the key reason it exists is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m28s)
00:56:28

[to do differential learning rates and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m31s)
00:56:31

[differential weight decay right but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m33s)
00:56:33

[reason we need to use it is that all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m36s)
00:56:36

[the mechanics inside fast AI assumes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m39s)
00:56:39

[that you have one of these right so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m41s)
00:56:41

[you want to use like callbacks or SPDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m43s)
00:56:43

[or whatever in code where you're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m46s)
00:56:46

[using the learner class then you need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m49s)
00:56:49

[use rather than saying you know opt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m52s)
00:56:52

[equals off to m dot atom and here's my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m54s)
00:56:54

[parameters you instead say lay optimizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h56m56s)
00:56:56

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m00s)
00:57:00

[so that gives us a layer optimizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m02s)
00:57:02

[object and if you're interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m06s)
00:57:06

[basically behind the scenes you can now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m08s)
00:57:08

[grab a dot opt property which actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m12s)
00:57:12

[gives you the optimizer but you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[have to worry about that itself but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m20s)
00:57:20

[that's basically what happens behind the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m21s)
00:57:21

[scenes the key thing we can now do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m23s)
00:57:23

[that we can now when we call fit we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m25s)
00:57:25

[pass in that optimizer and we can also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m29s)
00:57:29

[pass in some callbacks and specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m34s)
00:57:34

[we're going to use the cosine annealing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m36s)
00:57:36

[callback okay and so the cosine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m40s)
00:57:40

[annealing callback requires a layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m42s)
00:57:42

[optimizer object right and so what this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m45s)
00:57:45

[is going to do is it's going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m48s)
00:57:48

[cosine annealing by changing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m50s)
00:57:50

[learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m51s)
00:57:51

[right inside this object okay so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[details aren't terribly important we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m57s)
00:57:57

[talk about them on the forum it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h57m59s)
00:57:59

[the concept I wanted to get across here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m01s)
00:58:01

[right which is that now that we've done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m02s)
00:58:02

[this we can say all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m05s)
00:58:05

[create a cosine and kneeling callback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m06s)
00:58:06

[which is going to update the learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m08s)
00:58:08

[rates in this layer optimizer the length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m10s)
00:58:10

[of an epoch is equal to this here right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m14s)
00:58:14

[how many mini batches are there in an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m18s)
00:58:18

[epoch well it's whatever the length of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m19s)
00:58:19

[this data loader is okay so because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m22s)
00:58:22

[going to be it's going to be doing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m24s)
00:58:24

[cosine annealing it needs to know how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m25s)
00:58:25

[often to reset okay and then you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m27s)
00:58:27

[pass in the cycle more in the usual way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m31s)
00:58:31

[and then we can even save our model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m33s)
00:58:33

[automatically like you remember how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m37s)
00:58:37

[there was that cycle saved name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m39s)
00:58:39

[parameter that we can pass to learn not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m42s)
00:58:42

[fit this is what it does behind the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m44s)
00:58:44

[scenes behind the scenes it sets an on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m45s)
00:58:45

[cycle end callback and so here I have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[find that callback as being something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m51s)
00:58:51

[that saves my model okay so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m53s)
00:58:53

[quite a lot of cool stuff that you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h58m57s)
00:58:57

[do with callbacks callbacks are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m00s)
00:59:00

[basically things where you can define](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m02s)
00:59:02

[like at the start of training or at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[start of an epoch or at the side of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m06s)
00:59:06

[batch or at the end of training or at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m07s)
00:59:07

[the end of an epoch or at the end of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[batch please call this club okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m10s)
00:59:10

[we've written some for you including SGD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m13s)
00:59:13

[R which is the cosine annealing callback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m17s)
00:59:17

[and then so how I recently wrote a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m20s)
00:59:20

[callback to implement the new approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m23s)
00:59:23

[to decoupled weight decay we use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m26s)
00:59:26

[callbacks to draw those little graphs of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[the loss over time so there's lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m31s)
00:59:31

[cool stuff you can do with callbacks so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m34s)
00:59:34

[in this case by passing in that callback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m36s)
00:59:36

[we're getting as JDR and that's able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m39s)
00:59:39

[get us down to one point three one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m43s)
00:59:43

[and then we can train a little bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m48s)
00:59:48

[and eventually get down to one point two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m49s)
00:59:49

[five and so we can now test that out and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m54s)
00:59:54

[so if we passed in a few characters of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=00h59m58s)
00:59:58

[text we get not surprisingly and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m01s)
01:00:01

[after four thus let's do then 400 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[now we have our own Nietzsche so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m08s)
01:00:08

[Nietzsche tends to start his sections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m12s)
01:00:12

[with a number and a dot so 2 9 3 perhaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m14s)
01:00:14

[that every life the values of blood have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m17s)
01:00:17

[intercourse when it senses there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m20s)
01:00:20

[unscrupulous his very rights and still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m22s)
01:00:22

[impulse love ok so I mean it's slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m24s)
01:00:24

[less clear than Nietzsche normally but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m27s)
01:00:27

[it gets the tone right ok and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m29s)
01:00:29

[actually quite interesting like if to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m33s)
01:00:33

[play around with training these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m36s)
01:00:36

[character based language models to like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m38s)
01:00:38

[run this at different levels of loss to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m40s)
01:00:40

[get a sense of like what does it look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m44s)
01:00:44

[like like you really notice that this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m45s)
01:00:45

[like 1.25 and like that's slightly worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m49s)
01:00:49

[like 1.3 this looks like total junk you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m53s)
01:00:53

[know there's like punctuation in random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m57s)
01:00:57

[places and you know nothing makes sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h00m59s)
01:00:59

[and like you start to realize that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m01s)
01:01:01

[difference between you know Nietzsche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m03s)
01:01:03

[and random junk is not that far in kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m06s)
01:01:06

[of language model terms and so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m09s)
01:01:09

[train this for a little bit longer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m12s)
01:01:12

[you'll suddenly find like oh it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m13s)
01:01:13

[it's making more and more sense okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m15s)
01:01:15

[if you are playing around with NLP stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m18s)
01:01:18

[particularly generative stuff like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m21s)
01:01:21

[and you're like there is also like kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m23s)
01:01:23

[of okay but not great don't be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m27s)
01:01:27

[disheartened because that means you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m29s)
01:01:29

[actually very very nearly there you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m31s)
01:01:31

[the the difference between like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m33s)
01:01:33

[something which is starting to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m34s)
01:01:34

[something which almost vaguely looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m36s)
01:01:36

[English if you squint and something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m38s)
01:01:38

[that's actually a very good generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m40s)
01:01:40

[it's it's not it's not far in most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m42s)
01:01:42

[motion tests okay great so let's take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m45s)
01:01:45

[five-minute break we'll come back at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m49s)
01:01:49

[7:45 and we're going to go back to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m50s)
01:01:50

[computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m52s)
01:01:52

[okay so now become full circle back to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h01m57s)
01:01:57

[vision so now we're looking at less than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m04s)

[seven so far ten that book you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m10s)

[well-known data set in academia and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m20s)
01:02:20

[partly it's well known it's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m24s)
01:02:24

[pretty old by you know computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m26s)
01:02:26

[standards well before image net was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m30s)
01:02:30

[around there was sci-fi 10 you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m33s)
01:02:33

[wonder why we're going to be looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m35s)
01:02:35

[such an old data set and actually I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m37s)
01:02:37

[think small data sets are much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m39s)
01:02:39

[interesting than image net because like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m44s)
01:02:44

[most of the time you're likely to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m47s)
01:02:47

[working with stuff with a small number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m48s)
01:02:48

[of thousands of images rather than one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m51s)
01:02:51

[and a half million images some of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m54s)
01:02:54

[will work at one and a half million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m56s)
01:02:56

[images but most of you won't right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[learning how to use these kind of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h02m59s)
01:02:59

[sets I think is much more interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m01s)
01:03:01

[often also a lot of the stuff we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[looking at like in medical imaging we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m05s)
01:03:05

[looking at like the specific area where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m07s)
01:03:07

[there's a lung nodule you're probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[looking at like 32 by 32 pixels at most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m11s)
01:03:11

[as being the area where that lung nodule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m14s)
01:03:14

[actually exists right and so sci-fi 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m16s)
01:03:16

[is small both in terms of it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m19s)
01:03:19

[have many images and the images are very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[small and so therefore I think this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m23s)
01:03:23

[like it's been in a lot of ways is much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m25s)
01:03:25

[more challenging then something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m27s)
01:03:27

[image net and in some ways it's much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m30s)
01:03:30

[more interesting right and also most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m31s)
01:03:31

[importantly you can run stuff much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m34s)
01:03:34

[quickly on earth so it's much better to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m36s)
01:03:36

[test out your algorithms with something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m38s)
01:03:38

[you can run quickly and they're still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m41s)
01:03:41

[challenging and so I hear a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m43s)
01:03:43

[researchers complain about like how they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[can't afford to study all the different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[versions that their algorithm properly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m51s)
01:03:51

[because it's too expensive and they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[doing that on imagenet so like it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m55s)
01:03:55

[literally a week of you know expensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m57s)
01:03:57

[CP GPU work for every study they do and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h03m59s)
01:03:59

[like I don't understand why you would do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m02s)
01:04:02

[that kind of study on imagenet doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m04s)
01:04:04

[make sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m06s)
01:04:06

[yeah and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m07s)
01:04:07

[this has been a particularly you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m10s)
01:04:10

[there's been a particular a lot of kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m13s)
01:04:13

[of debate about this this week because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m15s)
01:04:15

[I'm really interesting researcher named](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m17s)
01:04:17

[Ali raha me nips this week gave a talk a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m19s)
01:04:19

[really great talk about kind of the need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m22s)
01:04:22

[for rigor in experiments in deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m24s)
01:04:24

[learning and you know he felt like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[there's a lack of rigor and I've talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m30s)
01:04:30

[to him about it quite a bit since that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[time and I'm not sure we yet quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m34s)
01:04:34

[understand each other as to where we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m38s)
01:04:38

[coming from but but we have very similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m40s)
01:04:40

[kinds of concerns which is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m42s)
01:04:42

[people aren't doing carefully tuned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m44s)
01:04:44

[carefully thought about experiments but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m48s)
01:04:48

[instead they kind of throw lots of GPUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m50s)
01:04:50

[or lots of data and consider that a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m52s)
01:04:52

[and so this idea of like saying like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m54s)
01:04:54

[well you know it's my data statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m57s)
01:04:57

[it's my algorithm meant to be good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h04m59s)
01:04:59

[that's moral imagers at small data sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m01s)
01:05:01

[well if so let's study on sci-fi 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m04s)
01:05:04

[revin studying it on imagenet and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m07s)
01:05:07

[do more studies of different versions of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m09s)
01:05:09

[the algorithm and learning different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m12s)
01:05:12

[bits on and off understand which parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m13s)
01:05:13

[are actually important and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m15s)
01:05:15

[people also complain a lot about amnesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m18s)
01:05:18

[which we've talked about looked at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m20s)
01:05:20

[before and I would say the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m23s)
01:05:23

[about em this right which is like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m25s)
01:05:25

[you're actually trying to understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m26s)
01:05:26

[rich parts of your algorithm make a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m27s)
01:05:27

[difference and why using m mr that kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m29s)
01:05:29

[of study is a very good idea and all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m32s)
01:05:32

[these people who complain about em NIST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m34s)
01:05:34

[I think they're just showing off they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m36s)
01:05:36

[saying like oh I work at Google and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m38s)
01:05:38

[have you know a part of TP use and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m40s)
01:05:40

[have $100,000 a week of time just being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m42s)
01:05:42

[on it no worries but I don't know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m44s)
01:05:44

[think that's all it is you know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m48s)
01:05:48

[just signalling rather than actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m49s)
01:05:49

[academically rigorous okay so I'm so far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[ten you can download from here and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m55s)
01:05:55

[person is very kindly made it available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m58s)
01:05:58

[in image form if you google for size 510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h05m59s)
01:05:59

[you'll find us a much less convenient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m04s)
01:06:04

[form so please use this one it's already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m06s)
01:06:06

[in the exact form you need once you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m09s)
01:06:09

[download it you can use it in the usual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m10s)
01:06:10

[way so here's a list of the classes that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m13s)
01:06:13

[are there now you'll see here I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m19s)
01:06:19

[created this thing called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m22s)
01:06:22

[that's normally when we've been using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m23s)
01:06:23

[pre trained models we have been seeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m26s)
01:06:26

[transforms from model and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m31s)
01:06:31

[actually created the necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[transforms to convert our data set into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[a normalized data set based on the means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m41s)
01:06:41

[and standard deviations of each channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m43s)
01:06:43

[in the original model that was trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[in our case though this time we got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m48s)
01:06:48

[trainer model from scratch so we have no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m50s)
01:06:50

[such thing so we actually need to tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m53s)
01:06:53

[it the mean and standard deviation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m55s)
01:06:55

[our data to normalize it okay and so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h06m59s)
01:06:59

[this case I haven't included the code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m02s)
01:07:02

[here to do it you should try and try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m04s)
01:07:04

[this yourself to confirm that you can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m06s)
01:07:06

[this and understand where it comes from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m08s)
01:07:08

[but this is just the mean channel and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[the standard deviation per channel of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m11s)
01:07:11

[all of the images alright so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m14s)
01:07:14

[to try and create a model from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m20s)
01:07:20

[and so the first thing we need is some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m24s)
01:07:24

[transformations so for so far 10 people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m26s)
01:07:26

[generally do data augmentation of simply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m30s)
01:07:30

[flipping randomly horizontally so here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m34s)
01:07:34

[how we can create a specific list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m38s)
01:07:38

[augmentations to use and then they also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[tend to add a little bit of padding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m44s)
01:07:44

[black padding around the edge and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m47s)
01:07:47

[randomly pick a 32 by 32 spot from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[within that pattern image so if you add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m53s)
01:07:53

[the pad parameter to any of the fast a a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m55s)
01:07:55

[transform creators it'll it'll do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h07m58s)
01:07:58

[for you okay and so in this case I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m01s)
01:08:01

[just going to add 4 pixels around each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m05s)
01:08:05

[size and so now that I've got my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m09s)
01:08:09

[transforms I can go ahead and create my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m12s)
01:08:12

[image classifier data from paths in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m14s)
01:08:14

[usual way okay I'm going to use a batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m18s)
01:08:18

[size of 256 because these are pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m22s)
01:08:22

[small so it's going to let me do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m24s)
01:08:24

[little bit more at a time so here's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[the data looks like so for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m28s)
01:08:28

[here's a boat and just to show you how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m31s)
01:08:31

[tough this is what's that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m33s)
01:08:33

[okay it is it's a not chicken prog-rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m37s)
01:08:37

[so I guess it's this big thing whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m42s)
01:08:42

[the thing is called there's your frog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m45s)
01:08:45

[okay so so these are the kinds of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m47s)
01:08:47

[that we want to look at so I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m51s)
01:08:51

[start out so our student Karen we saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m54s)
01:08:54

[one of his posts earlier in this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h08m57s)
01:08:57

[he he made this really cool log book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m00s)
01:09:00

[which shows how different optimizers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m03s)
01:09:03

[works there we go so Karen made this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m07s)
01:09:07

[really cool notebook I think it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m12s)
01:09:12

[maybe last week in which he showed how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m14s)
01:09:14

[to create various different optimizers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m16s)
01:09:16

[from scratch so this is kind of like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m19s)
01:09:19

[Excel thing I had but this is the Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m20s)
01:09:20

[version of momentum and Adam and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m22s)
01:09:22

[Nesterov and Atta grad all written from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m25s)
01:09:25

[scratch it is very cool one of the nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m27s)
01:09:27

[things he did was he showed a tiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m29s)
01:09:29

[little general-purpose fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m32s)
01:09:32

[Network generator so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m35s)
01:09:35

[start with his so so he called that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m37s)
01:09:37

[simple net so are we so here's a simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m39s)
01:09:39

[class which has a list of fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m42s)
01:09:42

[connected layers okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m47s)
01:09:47

[whenever you create a list of layers in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[pi torch you have to wrap it in an end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m52s)
01:09:52

[module list just to tailpipe torch to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m54s)
01:09:54

[like register these as attributes and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h09m57s)
01:09:57

[then we just go ahead and flatten the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m01s)
01:10:01

[data that comes in because it's fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m04s)
01:10:04

[connected layers and then go through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m05s)
01:10:05

[each layer and call that linear layer do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m07s)
01:10:07

[the value to it and at the end do a soft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[mess okay so there's a really simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m15s)
01:10:15

[approach and so we can now take that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m17s)
01:10:17

[model and now I'm going to show you how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[to step up one level of the API higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m23s)
01:10:23

[rather than calling the fit function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m26s)
01:10:26

[we're going to create a learn object but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m28s)
01:10:28

[we're going to create a learn object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m30s)
01:10:30

[from a custom model and so we can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m31s)
01:10:31

[that by say we want a convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m35s)
01:10:35

[learner we want to create it from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m37s)
01:10:37

[model and from some data and the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m39s)
01:10:39

[is this one so this is just a general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m42s)
01:10:42

[height watch model and this is a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m45s)
01:10:45

[data object of the usual kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m49s)
01:10:49

[and that will return a loaner so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m51s)
01:10:51

[a bit easier than what we just saw with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m53s)
01:10:53

[the RNN we don't have to fiddle around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m55s)
01:10:55

[with lair optimizers and cosine and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m57s)
01:10:57

[kneeling and callbacks and whatever this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h10m59s)
01:10:59

[is now a loaner that we can do all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m01s)
01:11:01

[usual stuff with that we can do it with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m03s)
01:11:03

[any model that we created okay so if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m06s)
01:11:06

[just go learn that'll go ahead and print](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m11s)
01:11:11

[it out okay so you can see we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[three thousand and seventy two features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m16s)
01:11:16

[coming in because you've got 32 by 32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m17s)
01:11:17

[pixels by three channels okay and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[we've got 40 features coming out of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m22s)
01:11:22

[first layer that's going to go into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m24s)
01:11:24

[second layer ten features coming out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m26s)
01:11:26

[because we've got the ten so far ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m28s)
01:11:28

[categories okay you can call dot summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m31s)
01:11:31

[to see that a little bit more detail we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m35s)
01:11:35

[can do LR find we can plot that and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m38s)
01:11:38

[can then go fetch and we can use cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[length and so forth okay so with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m44s)
01:11:44

[simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m48s)
01:11:48

[how many hidden layers do we have one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m50s)
01:11:50

[hidden layer right one getting layer one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m52s)
01:11:52

[output layer one hidden layer model with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m54s)
01:11:54

[and here we can see the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h11m58s)
01:11:58

[parameters we have is that over 120,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m00s)
01:12:00

[okay we get a 47 percent accuracy so not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[great all right so let's kind of try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m13s)
01:12:13

[improve it right and so the goal here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m15s)
01:12:15

[we're going to try and eventually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m18s)
01:12:18

[replicate the basic kind of architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m19s)
01:12:19

[of a resonator okay so that's where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m24s)
01:12:24

[we're going to try and get to hear it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m26s)
01:12:26

[specially built up to a resonant so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m27s)
01:12:27

[first step is to replace our fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m30s)
01:12:30

[connected model with a convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m32s)
01:12:32

[model okay so to remind you so to remind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m34s)
01:12:34

[you a fully connected layer is simply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m44s)
01:12:44

[doing a dot product right so if we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m47s)
01:12:47

[like all of these data points and all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m50s)
01:12:50

[these weights right then we basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m54s)
01:12:54

[do a sum product of all of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h12m59s)
01:12:59

[together right in other words it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m02s)
01:13:02

[matrix multiply right then that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m03s)
01:13:03

[fully connected layer okay and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[need the white matrix is going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m10s)
01:13:10

[contain an item for every every element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m12s)
01:13:12

[of the input for every element of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m15s)
01:13:15

[output okay so that's why we have here a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m17s)
01:13:17

[pretty big weight matrix and so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m19s)
01:13:19

[why we had despite the fact that we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m26s)
01:13:26

[such a crappy accuracy we have a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m28s)
01:13:28

[parameters because in this very first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m31s)
01:13:31

[layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m33s)
01:13:33

[we've got 3072 coming in and for T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m34s)
01:13:34

[coming out so that gives us three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m39s)
01:13:39

[thousand times forty parameters and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m41s)
01:13:41

[we end up not using them very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m44s)
01:13:44

[efficiently because we're basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m46s)
01:13:46

[saying every single pixel in the input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m48s)
01:13:48

[has a different weight and of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m50s)
01:13:50

[what we really want to do is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m52s)
01:13:52

[find groups of three by three pixels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m53s)
01:13:53

[that have particular patterns to them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m56s)
01:13:56

[okay and remember we call that a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[convolution okay so a convolution looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m00s)
01:14:00

[like so we have like little 3x3 section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m10s)
01:14:10

[of our image and a corresponding 3x3 set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m14s)
01:14:14

[of filters right or our filter with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m20s)
01:14:20

[three by three kernel and we just do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m22s)
01:14:22

[sum product of just that three by three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m25s)
01:14:25

[by that three by three okay and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m28s)
01:14:28

[do that for every single part of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m31s)
01:14:31

[image right and so when we do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m35s)
01:14:35

[across the whole image that's called a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m37s)
01:14:37

[convolution and remember in this case we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m38s)
01:14:38

[actually had multiple filters right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m42s)
01:14:42

[the result of that convolution actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m45s)
01:14:45

[had multiple it was a tensor with an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m47s)
01:14:47

[additional third dimension to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m50s)
01:14:50

[effectively so let's take exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m53s)
01:14:53

[same code that we had before but we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h14m58s)
01:14:58

[going to replace n n dot linear with NN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m01s)
01:15:01

[com2 D okay now what I want to do in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m04s)
01:15:04

[this case though is each time I have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m09s)
01:15:09

[layer I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[the next layer smaller and so the way I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m13s)
01:15:13

[did that in my Excel example was I used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m17s)
01:15:17

[max Pauling right so max Pauling took](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[every 2x2 section and replaced it with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m24s)
01:15:24

[this maximum value right nowadays we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m27s)
01:15:27

[don't use that kind of max bowling much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m31s)
01:15:31

[at all instead nowadays what we tend to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m34s)
01:15:34

[do is do what's called a stride to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m37s)
01:15:37

[convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m39s)
01:15:39

[let's drag to convolution rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m40s)
01:15:40

[saying let's go through every single 3x3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m43s)
01:15:43

[it says let's go through every second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m49s)
01:15:49

[3x3 so rather than moving this three by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[three one to the right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m57s)
01:15:57

[we move it two to the right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h15m58s)
01:15:58

[when we get to the end of the row rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m01s)
01:16:01

[than moving one row down we move two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m02s)
01:16:02

[rows down okay so that's called a stride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m05s)
01:16:05

[to convolution and so it's tried to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[convolution has the same kind of effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m10s)
01:16:10

[as a max pooling which is you end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m13s)
01:16:13

[having the resolution in each dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m15s)
01:16:15

[so we can ask for that by saying stroud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m18s)
01:16:18

[equals to okay we can say we wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m21s)
01:16:21

[be three by three by saying kernel size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m24s)
01:16:24

[and then the first term parameters are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m26s)
01:16:26

[exactly the same as nn but linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[they're the number of features coming in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m30s)
01:16:30

[and the number of features coming out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m31s)
01:16:31

[okay so we create a multiple list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m34s)
01:16:34

[those layers and then at the very end of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m37s)
01:16:37

[that so in this case I'm going to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m42s)
01:16:42

[okay I've got three channels coming in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m44s)
01:16:44

[the first one layer will come out with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m46s)
01:16:46

[20 then a at 40 and then 80 so if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m48s)
01:16:48

[look at the summary we're going to start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m52s)
01:16:52

[with a 32 by 32 we're going to spit out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m53s)
01:16:53

[of 15 by 15 and then a 7 by 7 and then a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[3 by 3 right and so what do we do now to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m01s)
01:17:01

[get that down to a prediction of one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m06s)
01:17:06

[10 classes what we do is we do something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m08s)
01:17:08

[called adaptive max pooling and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m12s)
01:17:12

[what is pretty standard now for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m15s)
01:17:15

[state-of-the-art algorithms is that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[very last layer we do a max pool but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[rather than doing like a 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m24s)
01:17:24

[go to next Paul we say like it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m26s)
01:17:26

[have you to bow to could have been 3x3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m30s)
01:17:30

[which is like replace every three by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m31s)
01:17:31

[three pixels with its maximum could have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m33s)
01:17:33

[been four by four adaptive backs Paul is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[where you say I'm not going to tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[how big an area to pull but instead I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m41s)
01:17:41

[going to tell you how big a resolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m44s)
01:17:44

[to create right so if I said for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m46s)
01:17:46

[I think my input here is like 28 by 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m51s)
01:17:51

[right if I said do a 14 by 14 adaptive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[max Paul that would be the same as a 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h17m59s)
01:17:59

[by 2 max Paul because in other that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m01s)
01:18:01

[saying please create a 14 by 14 output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m03s)
01:18:03

[if I said do a 2 by 2 adaptive max Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m06s)
01:18:06

[right then that would be the same as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m10s)
01:18:10

[saying do a 14 by 14 max Paul and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m12s)
01:18:12

[what we pretty much always do in modern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m17s)
01:18:17

[cnn's is we make our per northmet layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m19s)
01:18:19

[a 1 by 1 adaptive Max Paul so in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m22s)
01:18:22

[words find the single largest cell and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m28s)
01:18:28

[use that as our new activation right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m33s)
01:18:33

[so once we've got that we've now got a 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m39s)
01:18:39

[by 1 tensor right we're actually 1 by 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m43s)
01:18:43

[by number of features tensor so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m47s)
01:18:47

[then on top of that go view X dot view X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m50s)
01:18:50

[dot size comma minus 1 and actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m54s)
01:18:54

[there are no other dimensions to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h18m57s)
01:18:57

[basically right so this is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m01s)
01:19:01

[return a matrix of mini-batch by number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m03s)
01:19:03

[of features and so then we can feed that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m07s)
01:19:07

[into a linear layer with however many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m10s)
01:19:10

[classes we need right so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m15s)
01:19:15

[here the last thing I pass in is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m18s)
01:19:18

[many classes am I trying to predict and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m20s)
01:19:20

[that's what's going to be used to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m22s)
01:19:22

[that last layer so it goes through every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m23s)
01:19:23

[convolutional layer does a convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m26s)
01:19:26

[does arel you does an adaptive max pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m28s)
01:19:28

[this dot view just gets rid of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m33s)
01:19:33

[trailing unit backsies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m36s)
01:19:36

[one comma one axis which is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m39s)
01:19:39

[necessary that allows us to fit that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m42s)
01:19:42

[into our final linear layer that spits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m45s)
01:19:45

[out something of size C which here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m47s)
01:19:47

[ten so you can now see how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m51s)
01:19:51

[it goes 32 to 15 to 7 by 7 to 3 by 3 the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m54s)
01:19:54

[adaptive next pull makes it 80 by 1 by 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h19m59s)
01:19:59

[right and then our dot view makes it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m04s)
01:20:04

[just a mini batch size by 80 and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m07s)
01:20:07

[finally a linear layer which makes it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m10s)
01:20:10

[from 80 to 10 which is what we wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m12s)
01:20:12

[okay so that's our like most basic you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[would call this a fully convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m19s)
01:20:19

[network so a fully convolutional network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m21s)
01:20:21

[is something where every layer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m23s)
01:20:23

[convolutional except for the very last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m25s)
01:20:25

[so again we can now go Li dot find and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m31s)
01:20:31

[now in this case when I did ll find it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m35s)
01:20:35

[went through the entire data set and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m39s)
01:20:39

[we're still getting better and so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m41s)
01:20:41

[other words even a the default final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m43s)
01:20:43

[learning rate rises 10 and even at that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m46s)
01:20:46

[point it was still like pretty much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m48s)
01:20:48

[getting better so you can always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m50s)
01:20:50

[override the final learning rate by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m52s)
01:20:52

[saying n del R equals that and that will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m54s)
01:20:54

[get it just to get it to try morphine's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m57s)
01:20:57

[okay and so here is the learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h20m58s)
01:20:58

[finder and so I picked 10 to the minus 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m01s)
01:21:01

[trained that for a while and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m06s)
01:21:06

[looking pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m09s)
01:21:09

[so I try to put the cycle length of 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m10s)
01:21:10

[and it's starting to flatten out at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m12s)
01:21:12

[about 60% right so you can see here the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m14s)
01:21:14

[number of elements the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m18s)
01:21:18

[parameters I have here are 500 7000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m20s)
01:21:20

[28,000 about 30,000 right so I have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m24s)
01:21:24

[about a quarter of the number of routers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m28s)
01:21:28

[that my accuracy has gone up from 47% to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[60% right and the time per epoch here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m34s)
01:21:34

[under 30 seconds and here also so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m38s)
01:21:38

[time period box about the same and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m43s)
01:21:43

[that's not surprising because when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m44s)
01:21:44

[use small simple architectures most of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m46s)
01:21:46

[the time is the memory transfer the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m49s)
01:21:49

[actual time during the compute is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m51s)
01:21:51

[is trivial okay so I'm going to refactor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m53s)
01:21:53

[this slightly because I want to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h21m58s)
01:21:58

[put less stuff inside my forward and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m01s)
01:22:01

[calling RAL you every time you know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m05s)
01:22:05

[doesn't seem ideal so I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m07s)
01:22:07

[create a new class called conf lair okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m09s)
01:22:09

[and the conf lair class is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[contain a convolution with a kernel size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m15s)
01:22:15

[of three and a stride of two one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m18s)
01:22:18

[I'm going to do now is I'm going to add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m21s)
01:22:21

[padding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m22s)
01:22:22

[did you notice here the first layer went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m22s)
01:22:22

[from 32 by 32 to 15 by 15 not 16 by 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m25s)
01:22:25

[and the reason for that is that at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m30s)
01:22:30

[very edge of your convolution right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m33s)
01:22:33

[see how this first convolution like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m42s)
01:22:42

[there isn't a convolution where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m45s)
01:22:45

[middle is the top left point right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m46s)
01:22:46

[because there's like nothing outside it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m49s)
01:22:49

[where else if we had put a row of zeros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m52s)
01:22:52

[at the top and a row of zeros at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m55s)
01:22:55

[edge of each column we now could go all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h22m57s)
01:22:57

[the way to the edge alright so pad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m01s)
01:23:01

[equals 1 adds that little layer of zeros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m03s)
01:23:03

[around the edge for us ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[and so this way we're going to make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m10s)
01:23:10

[that we go 32 by 32 to 16 by 16 to 8 by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m12s)
01:23:12

[8 it doesn't matter too much when you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m16s)
01:23:16

[got these bigger layers but by the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m18s)
01:23:18

[you get down to like say 4 by 4 you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m20s)
01:23:20

[really don't want to throw away a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m23s)
01:23:23

[piece right so padding becomes important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m25s)
01:23:25

[so by refactoring it to put this with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m27s)
01:23:27

[its defaults here and then in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m32s)
01:23:32

[forward I put the value in here as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m33s)
01:23:33

[it makes by confident you know a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m35s)
01:23:35

[bit smaller and you know more to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m39s)
01:23:39

[point it's going to be easier for me to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m41s)
01:23:41

[make sure that everything is correct in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m42s)
01:23:42

[the future by always using this common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m44s)
01:23:44

[player class ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m46s)
01:23:46

[so now you know not only how to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m47s)
01:23:47

[your own neural network model but how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m50s)
01:23:50

[create your own neural network layer so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m52s)
01:23:52

[here now I can use conf layer right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m55s)
01:23:55

[this is such a cool thing about pi torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h23m58s)
01:23:58

[is a layer definition and a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m00s)
01:24:00

[network definition are literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m03s)
01:24:03

[identical okay they both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m04s)
01:24:04

[have a constructor and a forward and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m06s)
01:24:06

[anytime you've got the lair you can use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m09s)
01:24:09

[it as a neural net anytime you have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m12s)
01:24:12

[neural net you can use it as a lair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m13s)
01:24:13

[okay so this is now the exact same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m15s)
01:24:15

[as we had before one difference is I now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m18s)
01:24:18

[have padding okay and another thing just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[to show you you can do things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m23s)
01:24:23

[differently back here my max pool I did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m24s)
01:24:24

[as as an object likely I use the class n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m29s)
01:24:29

[n dot adaptive max pool and I stuck it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m33s)
01:24:33

[in this attribute and then I called it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m35s)
01:24:35

[but this actually doesn't have any state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m37s)
01:24:37

[there's no weights inside max pooling so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m40s)
01:24:40

[I can actually do it with a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m44s)
01:24:44

[less code by calling it as a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m45s)
01:24:45

[right so everything that you can do as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m47s)
01:24:47

[class you can also do as a function it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m50s)
01:24:50

[inside this capital F which is n n dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m52s)
01:24:52

[functional okay so this should be a tiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m54s)
01:24:54

[bit better because this time I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h24m59s)
01:24:59

[the padding I didn't trade it for as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m03s)
01:25:03

[long to actually check so let's skip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m06s)
01:25:06

[over that all right so one issue here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m09s)
01:25:09

[that in the end this is having I when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m14s)
01:25:14

[tried to add more layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m19s)
01:25:19

[I had travel training it okay and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m21s)
01:25:21

[reason I was having trouble training it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m26s)
01:25:26

[is it was you know if I used larger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m27s)
01:25:27

[learning rates it would go off to NI N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m30s)
01:25:30

[and if I use smaller learning rates that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m31s)
01:25:31

[are kind of takes forever and doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m34s)
01:25:34

[really have a chance to explore properly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m35s)
01:25:35

[so it wasn't resilient so to make my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m37s)
01:25:37

[model more resilient I'm going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m41s)
01:25:41

[something called batch normalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m43s)
01:25:43

[which literally everybody calls bachelor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m44s)
01:25:44

[and bachelorettes a couple of years old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m47s)
01:25:47

[now and it's been pretty transformative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m51s)
01:25:51

[since it came along because it suddenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m54s)
01:25:54

[makes it really easy to train deeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h25m57s)
01:25:57

[networks alright so the network I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m00s)
01:26:00

[going to create is going to have more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m02s)
01:26:02

[layers right I've got one two three four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m04s)
01:26:04

[five convolutional layers plus a fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m07s)
01:26:07

[connected layer right so like back in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m09s)
01:26:09

[the old days that would be considered a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m11s)
01:26:11

[pretty deep network and we considered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m13s)
01:26:13

[pretty hard to train nowadays super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m15s)
01:26:15

[simple thanks to vaginal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m17s)
01:26:17

[now to use batch norm you can just write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m20s)
01:26:20

[in end on that to learn about it we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m23s)
01:26:23

[going to write it from scratch okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m25s)
01:26:25

[the basic idea of batch norm is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m28s)
01:26:28

[we've got some vector of activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m32s)
01:26:32

[anytime I draw a vector of activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m35s)
01:26:35

[obviously I mean you can repeat it for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m37s)
01:26:37

[the mini batch so I pretend it's a mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[batch with one so we've got some veteran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m41s)
01:26:41

[activations and it's coming into some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m43s)
01:26:43

[layer right so so probably some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m46s)
01:26:46

[convolutional matrix multiplication and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m49s)
01:26:49

[then something comes out the other side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m52s)
01:26:52

[so imagine this this is just a matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m55s)
01:26:55

[multiply which was like I don't know say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h26m58s)
01:26:58

[it was a identity matrix right then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m01s)
01:27:01

[every time I'd multiply it by that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m11s)
01:27:11

[across lots and lots of layers my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m12s)
01:27:12

[activations are not getting bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m14s)
01:27:14

[they're not getting smaller they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m16s)
01:27:16

[changing at all okay that's all fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m17s)
01:27:17

[right but imagine if it was actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m20s)
01:27:20

[like 2 2 2 right and so if every one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m22s)
01:27:22

[my weight matrices or filters was like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m28s)
01:27:28

[that then my activations are doubling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m29s)
01:27:29

[each time right and so suddenly I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m32s)
01:27:32

[as exponential growth and that in deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m35s)
01:27:35

[models that's going to be a disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m40s)
01:27:40

[right because my gradients are exploding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m41s)
01:27:41

[at an exponential rate and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m44s)
01:27:44

[challenge you have is that it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m47s)
01:27:47

[very unlikely unless you try carefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m50s)
01:27:50

[to deal with it that your matrices your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m54s)
01:27:54

[weight matrices on average are not going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h27m57s)
01:27:57

[to cause your activations to keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m00s)
01:28:00

[getting smaller and smaller or keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m03s)
01:28:03

[getting bigger and bigger right you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m04s)
01:28:04

[to kind of carefully control things to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m06s)
01:28:06

[make sure that they stay you know at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m08s)
01:28:08

[reasonable size you want to you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m11s)
01:28:11

[keep them at a reasonable scale so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m13s)
01:28:13

[start things off with zero mean standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m16s)
01:28:16

[deviation one by normalizing the inputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m20s)
01:28:20

[really like to do is to normalize every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m23s)
01:28:23

[layer not just the inputs all right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m27s)
01:28:27

[so okay fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m30s)
01:28:30

[let's do that right so here I've created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m34s)
01:28:34

[a BN layer which is exactly like my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m37s)

[Kampf layer it's got my common 2d with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m39s)
01:28:39

[my stride my padding right I do my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m42s)
01:28:42

[condom I value right and then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m45s)
01:28:45

[calculate the mean of each channel or of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m48s)
01:28:48

[each filter and the standard deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m53s)
01:28:53

[of each channel or each filter and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m56s)
01:28:56

[I subtract the means and divide by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h28m58s)
01:28:58

[standard deviations right so now I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m02s)
01:29:02

[actually need to normalize my input at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m06s)
01:29:06

[all because it's actually going to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m09s)
01:29:09

[automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m11s)
01:29:11

[right it's normalizing it per channel or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m11s)
01:29:11

[and for later layers its normalizing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m15s)
01:29:15

[per filter so it turns out that's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m17s)
01:29:17

[enough right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m22s)
01:29:22

[because SGD is bloody-minded right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m24s)
01:29:24

[so if sgt decided that it what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m29s)
01:29:29

[weight matrix to be you know like so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m33s)
01:29:33

[where that matrix is something which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m35s)
01:29:35

[going to you know increase the values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m38s)
01:29:38

[overall repeatedly then trying to divide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m41s)
01:29:41

[it by the subtract domains and divide by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m45s)
01:29:45

[the standard deviations just means the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m47s)
01:29:47

[next mini-batch it's going to try and do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m49s)
01:29:49

[it again and they were try and do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m51s)
01:29:51

[again it'll try and do it again so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m52s)
01:29:52

[turns out that this actually doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m54s)
01:29:54

[help like it literally does nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m57s)
01:29:57

[because SGD is just going to go ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h29m58s)
01:29:58

[and undo it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m01s)
01:30:01

[the next mini batch so what we do is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m03s)
01:30:03

[create a new multiplier for each channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m08s)
01:30:08

[and a new added value for each Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m13s)
01:30:13

[literally just and we just start them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m19s)
01:30:19

[out as the addition and addition is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m21s)
01:30:21

[a bunch of zeros so for the first layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m23s)
01:30:23

[three zeros and the multiplier for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m25s)
01:30:25

[first layer is just three ones okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m28s)
01:30:28

[number of filters for the first layer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m31s)
01:30:31

[just three and so we then like basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m33s)
01:30:33

[undo exactly what we just did or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m36s)
01:30:36

[potentially we undo them right so by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[saying this is an addenda parameter that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m42s)
01:30:42

[tells PI torch you're allowed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m44s)
01:30:44

[to learn these as weights right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m47s)
01:30:47

[initially it says okay so check the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m50s)
01:30:50

[means divided by the standard deviations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m52s)
01:30:52

[multiplied by one add on zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m54s)
01:30:54

[okay that's fine nothing much happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h30m59s)
01:30:59

[there but what it turns out is that now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m01s)
01:31:01

[rather than like if it wants to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m05s)
01:31:05

[scale the layer up it doesn't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m08s)
01:31:08

[scale up every single value in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m11s)
01:31:11

[matrix it can just scale up this single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m13s)
01:31:13

[trio of numbers self dot M if it wants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m17s)
01:31:17

[to shift it all Apple down a bit doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m21s)
01:31:21

[have to shift the entire weight matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m23s)
01:31:23

[they can just shift this trio of numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m26s)
01:31:26

[self dot a so I will say this I'm at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m28s)
01:31:28

[this talk I mentioned at nips Alley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m34s)
01:31:34

[Rahim ease talk about rigor he actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m36s)
01:31:36

[pointed to this paper this batch norm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m38s)
01:31:38

[paper as being a particularly useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m40s)
01:31:40

[particularly interesting paper where a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m44s)
01:31:44

[lot of people don't necessarily we quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m48s)
01:31:48

[quite know why it was right and so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m52s)
01:31:52

[you're thinking like okay subtracting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m56s)
01:31:56

[out the means and then adding some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h31m58s)
01:31:58

[learned weights of exactly the same rank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m00s)
01:32:00

[and size sounds like a weird thing to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m05s)
01:32:05

[there are a lot of people that feel the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m09s)
01:32:09

[same way right so at the moment I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m11s)
01:32:11

[the best is I can say like intuitively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m15s)
01:32:15

[is what's going on here is that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m17s)
01:32:17

[normalizing the data and then we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m21s)
01:32:21

[saying you can then shift it and scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m24s)
01:32:24

[it using far fewer parameters than would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m28s)
01:32:28

[have been necessary if I was asking you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m31s)
01:32:31

[to actually shift and scale the entire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m34s)
01:32:34

[set of convolutional filters right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m36s)
01:32:36

[that's the kind of basic intuition more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m39s)
01:32:39

[importantly in practice what this does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m42s)
01:32:42

[is it adds is it basically allows us to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m46s)
01:32:46

[increase our learning rates and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m50s)
01:32:50

[increases the resilience of training and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m52s)
01:32:52

[allows us to add more layers so once I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m54s)
01:32:54

[added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h32m58s)
01:32:58

[a PN layer rather than a common flower I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m00s)
01:33:00

[found I was able to add more layers to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m05s)
01:33:05

[my model and it still trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m08s)
01:33:08

[effectively generally are we worried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m10s)
01:33:10

[about anything that maybe we are divided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m17s)
01:33:17

[by something very small or anything like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m20s)
01:33:20

[that once we do this probably I think in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m24s)
01:33:24

[the pie chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m28s)
01:33:28

[version it would probably be divided by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m29s)
01:33:29

[itself dudes plus Epsilon or something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m33s)
01:33:33

[yeah this worked fine for me but yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m35s)
01:33:35

[that is definitely something to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m42s)
01:33:42

[about if you were trying to make this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m43s)
01:33:43

[more reliable I mentioned poplar so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m45s)
01:33:45

[self dot m and self dot a getting it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m52s)
01:33:52

[getting updated through back propagation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m55s)
01:33:55

[as well yeah so by putting like saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h33m57s)
01:33:57

[it's an N n dot parameter that's how we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m00s)
01:34:00

[flag to pi torch to learn it through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m02s)
01:34:02

[that probe exactly right the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m05s)
01:34:05

[interesting thing it turns out the batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m10s)
01:34:10

[norm does is it regularizes in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m11s)
01:34:11

[words you can often decrease or remove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m16s)
01:34:16

[drop out or decrease or remove weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m18s)
01:34:18

[okay when you use batch normal and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m21s)
01:34:21

[reason why is if you think about it each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m23s)
01:34:23

[mini batch is going to have a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[mean and a different standard deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m30s)
01:34:30

[to the previous mini batch so these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m32s)
01:34:32

[things keep changing and because they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m34s)
01:34:34

[keep changing it's kind of changing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m37s)
01:34:37

[meaning of the filters in this subtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m39s)
01:34:39

[way and so it's adding a regularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m41s)
01:34:41

[effect because it's noise that when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m44s)
01:34:44

[add noise of any kind it regularizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m46s)
01:34:46

[your model all right I'm actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m50s)
01:34:50

[cheating a little bit here in the real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m52s)
01:34:52

[version of batch norm you don't just use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m55s)
01:34:55

[this batches mean and standard deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h34m59s)
01:34:59

[but instead you take an exponentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m01s)
01:35:01

[weighted moving average standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m04s)
01:35:04

[deviation and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m07s)
01:35:07

[and so if you wanted to exercise to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m08s)
01:35:08

[a during the week that would be a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m10s)
01:35:10

[thing to try but I will point out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m12s)
01:35:12

[something very important here which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m15s)
01:35:15

[if self-training when we are doing our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m16s)
01:35:16

[training loop this will be true when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m23s)
01:35:23

[it's being applied to the training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m25s)
01:35:25

[and it will be false when it's being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m28s)
01:35:28

[applied to the validation set and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m30s)
01:35:30

[is really important because when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m33s)
01:35:33

[going through the validation set you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m35s)
01:35:35

[not want to be changing the meaning of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m36s)
01:35:36

[the model okay so this is this really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m38s)
01:35:38

[important idea is that there are some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m42s)
01:35:42

[types of layer that are actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m45s)
01:35:45

[sensitive to what the mode of the of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m48s)
01:35:48

[network is whether it's in training mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m53s)
01:35:53

[or as plight which calls it evaluation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m55s)
01:35:55

[mode or we might say a test mode right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h35m58s)
01:35:58

[and actually we actually had a bug a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m00s)
01:36:00

[couple of weeks ago when we did our mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m03s)
01:36:03

[net for movie lens the collaborative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m06s)
01:36:06

[filtering we actually had F dot dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m08s)
01:36:08

[in our forward pass without protecting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m11s)
01:36:11

[it with a F self training F dot dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m14s)
01:36:14

[as a result of which we were actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m18s)
01:36:18

[doing dropout in the validation piece as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m20s)
01:36:20

[well as the training piece which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m23s)
01:36:23

[obviously isn't what you want okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m25s)
01:36:25

[so I've actually gone back and fixed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m26s)
01:36:26

[this by changing it to using n n dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m28s)
01:36:28

[dropout and n n dot dropout has already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m32s)
01:36:32

[been written for us to check whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m36s)
01:36:36

[it's being used in training mode or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m38s)
01:36:38

[that or alternatively I could have added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m40s)
01:36:40

[a if self dot training before I use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m43s)
01:36:43

[dropout yeah okay so it's important to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m47s)
01:36:47

[think about that you know any and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m50s)
01:36:50

[main the main true or pretty much the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m53s)
01:36:53

[only two built-in two pi torch where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m54s)
01:36:54

[this happens is dropout and and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h36m57s)
01:36:57

[interestingly this is also a key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m02s)
01:37:02

[difference in fast AI which no other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m05s)
01:37:05

[library does is that these means and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m07s)
01:37:07

[standard deviations get updated in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m12s)
01:37:12

[training mode in every other library as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m16s)
01:37:16

[soon as you basically say I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m20s)
01:37:20

[training regardless even of whether that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m22s)
01:37:22

[layer is set to trainable or not and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m24s)
01:37:24

[turns out that with a pre trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m27s)
01:37:27

[network that's a terrible idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m28s)
01:37:28

[if you have a pre trained network for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m30s)
01:37:30

[specific values of those means and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m33s)
01:37:33

[standard deviations in batch norm if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m35s)
01:37:35

[change them it changes the meaning of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m37s)
01:37:37

[those pre trained layers right and so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m39s)
01:37:39

[fast AI always by default it won't touch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m42s)
01:37:42

[those means and standard deviations if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m45s)
01:37:45

[your layer is frozen okay as soon as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m47s)
01:37:47

[I'm freezing it'll start updating them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m51s)
01:37:51

[unless you've set won't be and freeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m54s)
01:37:54

[true if you set learned up being freeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h37m59s)
01:37:59

[true it says never touch these met means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m02s)
01:38:02

[and standard deviations and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m05s)
01:38:05

[I've found in practice that that often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m07s)
01:38:07

[seems to work a lot better for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m12s)
01:38:12

[pre-trained models particularly if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m13s)
01:38:13

[you're working with data that's quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m16s)
01:38:16

[similar to what the pre trained model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m17s)
01:38:17

[was trained with you know as you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m19s)
01:38:19

[like I did a lot of work did you say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m33s)
01:38:33

[sorry like quite a lot of code here well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m35s)
01:38:35

[you're doing more work than you would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m38s)
01:38:38

[normally do essentially you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m40s)
01:38:40

[calculating all these aggregates as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m42s)
01:38:42

[go through each each each layer yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m44s)
01:38:44

[wouldn't this mean you're training like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m46s)
01:38:46

[your epoch time like now this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m49s)
01:38:49

[super fast like if you think about what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m52s)
01:38:52

[a cone has to do a cones has to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m54s)
01:38:54

[through every 3x3 you know with a stride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h38m58s)
01:38:58

[and do this multiplication and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m01s)
01:39:01

[addition like that is a lot more work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m03s)
01:39:03

[than simply calculating the per channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m06s)
01:39:06

[mean so this is so and that's a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m10s)
01:39:10

[bit of time but it's it's less time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m12s)
01:39:12

[intensive than the convolution would it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m14s)
01:39:14

[be like right after like decomposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m21s)
01:39:21

[yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m25s)
01:39:25

[we'll talk about that in a moment so at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m26s)
01:39:26

[the moment we have it after the rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m28s)
01:39:28

[and in the original batch norm paper I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m32s)
01:39:32

[will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m34s)
01:39:34

[that's where they put it so this this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m35s)
01:39:35

[idea of something called an ablation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m41s)
01:39:41

[study and an ablation study is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m43s)
01:39:43

[where you basically try kind of turning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m48s)
01:39:48

[on and off different pieces of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m52s)
01:39:52

[model to see like which bits make which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m55s)
01:39:55

[impacts and one of the things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m57s)
01:39:57

[wasn't done in the original batch norm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h39m59s)
01:39:59

[paper was any kind of really effective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m01s)
01:40:01

[ablation study and one of the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m04s)
01:40:04

[therefore that was missing was this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m06s)
01:40:06

[question which you just asked which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m08s)
01:40:08

[like where do you put the vaginal before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m10s)
01:40:10

[the early year after the earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m12s)
01:40:12

[whatever and so since that time you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m13s)
01:40:13

[that oversight has caused a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m16s)
01:40:16

[problems because it turned out the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m18s)
01:40:18

[original paper didn't actually put it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m20s)
01:40:20

[the best spot and so then other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m22s)
01:40:22

[since then have now figured that out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m25s)
01:40:25

[and they're like every time I show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m27s)
01:40:27

[people code where it's actually in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m29s)
01:40:29

[spot that turns out to be better people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m31s)
01:40:31

[always say your bedrooms in the wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m33s)
01:40:33

[spot and I have to go back and say no I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m35s)
01:40:35

[know that's what the paper said what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m37s)
01:40:37

[they're doing now that's what I thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m38s)
01:40:38

[and so it's kind of causes confusion so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m39s)
01:40:39

[there's there's been a lot of question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m42s)
01:40:42

[about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m44s)
01:40:44

[so a little bit of a higher-level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m46s)
01:40:46

[question so we started out with cipher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m49s)
01:40:49

[data yes it's the basic reasoning that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m53s)
01:40:53

[you use a smaller data set to quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h40m59s)
01:40:59

[train a new model and then you take it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m02s)
01:41:02

[the same model and you're using much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m07s)
01:41:07

[much much bigger data set to get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m11s)
01:41:11

[higher accuracy level is that the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m14s)
01:41:14

[maybe so if you want to you know if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m17s)
01:41:17

[had a large data set or if you were like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m21s)
01:41:21

[interested in the question of like how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m23s)
01:41:23

[good is this technique on a large data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m27s)
01:41:27

[set then yes what you just said would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m29s)
01:41:29

[what I would do I would do lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m31s)
01:41:31

[testing on a small data set which I had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m33s)
01:41:33

[already discovered had the same kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m36s)
01:41:36

[properties as my larger data set and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m39s)
01:41:39

[therefore my conclusions would likely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m41s)
01:41:41

[carry forward and then our test them at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m43s)
01:41:43

[the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m45s)
01:41:45

[having said that personally I matched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m45s)
01:41:45

[be more interested in actually studying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m48s)
01:41:48

[small datasets for their own sake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m53s)
01:41:53

[because I find most people I speak to in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m55s)
01:41:55

[the real world don't have a million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h41m59s)
01:41:59

[images they have you know somewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m01s)
01:42:01

[between about two thousand and twenty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m03s)
01:42:03

[thousand images seems to be much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m05s)
01:42:05

[common so I'm very you know very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m06s)
01:42:06

[interested in having fewer rows because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m10s)
01:42:10

[I think it's more valuable in factors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m14s)
01:42:14

[I'm also pretty interested in small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m16s)
01:42:16

[images not just for the rest you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m19s)
01:42:19

[mentioned which is it allows me to test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m21s)
01:42:21

[things out more quickly but also as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m24s)
01:42:24

[mentioned before often a small part of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m26s)
01:42:26

[an image actually turns out to be what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m29s)
01:42:29

[you're interested in that's certainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m30s)
01:42:30

[true in in medicine I have two questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m32s)
01:42:32

[the first is on what you mentioned in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m38s)
01:42:38

[terms of small datasets particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m41s)
01:42:41

[middle medical imaging you've you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m43s)
01:42:43

[heard of I guess is it vicarious to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m44s)
01:42:44

[start up in the specialization and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m47s)
01:42:47

[one-shot learning so your opinions on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m48s)
01:42:48

[that and then this second being this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m50s)
01:42:50

[related to I guess Ali's talk at nips so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m53s)
01:42:53

[it was I don't say its controversial but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m57s)
01:42:57

[like young laocoön there was like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h42m58s)
01:42:58

[really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m01s)
01:43:01

[I guess controversial thread attacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m01s)
01:43:01

[you in terms of what you're talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m04s)
01:43:04

[about as a baseline of theory just not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m05s)
01:43:05

[keeping up with practice and so I mean I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m08s)
01:43:08

[guess I was siding with the on where's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m11s)
01:43:11

[all he actually he tweeted at me quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m13s)
01:43:13

[bit trying to defend like he wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m15s)
01:43:15

[attacking yawn at all but in fact he was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m17s)
01:43:17

[you know trying to support him but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m22s)
01:43:22

[just kind of feel like a lot of theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m24s)
01:43:24

[as as you go is just sort of at it they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m26s)
01:43:26

[even it's hard to keep up whether then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m29s)
01:43:29

[you know no archive from on Draco party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m31s)
01:43:31

[to keep up but if the theory isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m33s)
01:43:33

[keeping up but industry is the one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m35s)
01:43:35

[that's actually sitting in the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m37s)
01:43:37

[then doesn't that mean that you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m38s)
01:43:38

[people who are actual practitioners are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m40s)
01:43:40

[the ones like young lacunae are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m43s)
01:43:43

[publishing the theory that are keeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m44s)
01:43:44

[up to date or is like academic research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m45s)
01:43:45

[institutions are actually behind so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m47s)
01:43:47

[don't have any comments on the vicarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m49s)
01:43:49

[papers because I haven't read them I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m50s)
01:43:50

[not aware of any of them have as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m52s)
01:43:52

[actually showing you know better results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m54s)
01:43:54

[than the papers but I think they've come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h43m59s)
01:43:59

[a long way in the last twelve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m01s)
01:44:01

[so that might be wrong yeah yeah I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m02s)
01:44:02

[viewed the discussion between yarn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m05s)
01:44:05

[lacunae and a lyric Jimmy is very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m06s)
01:44:06

[interesting because they're both smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m08s)
01:44:08

[people who have interesting things to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m09s)
01:44:09

[say unfortunately a lot of people talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m11s)
01:44:11

[Ally's talk as meaning something which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m16s)
01:44:16

[he says it didn't mean and when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m19s)
01:44:19

[listened to his talk I'm not sure he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m21s)
01:44:21

[didn't actually made it at the time but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m23s)
01:44:23

[he clearly doesn't mean it now which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m25s)
01:44:25

[he's he's now said many times he didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m27s)
01:44:27

[he was not talking about theory he was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m29s)
01:44:29

[not saying we need more theory at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m31s)
01:44:31

[actually he thinks we need more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m33s)
01:44:33

[experiments and so specifically he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m35s)
01:44:35

[he's also now saying he wished he hadn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m39s)
01:44:39

[used the word rigour which I also wish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m41s)
01:44:41

[because rigour is it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m43s)
01:44:43

[meaningless and everybody can kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m46s)
01:44:46

[say when he says rigor he means the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m48s)
01:44:48

[specific thing I study you know so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m50s)
01:44:50

[lots of people have kind of taken his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m55s)
01:44:55

[talk as being like oh yes this proves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m57s)
01:44:57

[that nobody else should work in neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h44m59s)
01:44:59

[networks unless they are experts at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m01s)
01:45:01

[one thing I'm an expert in so yeah so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m04s)
01:45:04

[I'm going to catch up with him and talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m08s)
01:45:08

[about more about this in January and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m09s)
01:45:09

[hopefully we'll pick up some more stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m11s)
01:45:11

[out together but basically what would we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m12s)
01:45:12

[can clearly agree on and I think you and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m16s)
01:45:16

[also agrees on is careful experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m18s)
01:45:18

[are important just doing things on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m22s)
01:45:22

[massive amounts of data using massive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m25s)
01:45:25

[amounts of TP use or GP users not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m27s)
01:45:27

[interesting of itself and we should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m30s)
01:45:30

[instead try to design experiments that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m32s)
01:45:32

[give us the maximum amount of insight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m35s)
01:45:35

[into what's going on so Jeremy is it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m36s)
01:45:36

[good statement to say something like so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m42s)
01:45:42

[drop out and bash norm are very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m46s)
01:45:46

[different things drop out is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m51s)
01:45:51

[realization technique bash norm has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m54s)
01:45:54

[maybe some realization effect but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m57s)
01:45:57

[actually just about convergence of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h45m59s)
01:45:59

[optimization method yeah yeah and and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m02s)
01:46:02

[would further say like I can't see any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m06s)
01:46:06

[reason not to use pattern or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m10s)
01:46:10

[there are versions of batch norm that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m12s)
01:46:12

[certain situations turned out not to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m16s)
01:46:16

[work so well that people have figured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m18s)
01:46:18

[out ways around that for nearly every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m22s)
01:46:22

[one of those situations now so I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m24s)
01:46:24

[always seek to find a way to use batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m26s)
01:46:26

[norm it may be a little harder in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m29s)
01:46:29

[own ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m32s)
01:46:32

[at least but even there there are ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m33s)
01:46:33

[of doing batch norm in our attenders as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m37s)
01:46:37

[well so you know try try and always use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m39s)
01:46:39

[batch norm on every layer if you can and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m41s)
01:46:41

[the question that somebody asked is does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m44s)
01:46:44

[it mean I have to I can stop normalize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m47s)
01:46:47

[in my data yeah yeah it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m51s)
01:46:51

[although do it anyway because it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h46m57s)
01:46:57

[at all hard to do it and at least that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m03s)
01:47:03

[way the people using your data I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m06s)
01:47:06

[know they kind of know how you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m09s)
01:47:09

[normalized it and particularly with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m11s)
01:47:11

[these issues around a lot of libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m15s)
01:47:15

[in my opinion at least warm not my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m17s)
01:47:17

[opinion my experiments don't deal with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m19s)
01:47:19

[batch norm correctly for pre-trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m23s)
01:47:23

[models just remember that when somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m25s)
01:47:25

[starts retraining those averages and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m27s)
01:47:27

[stuff are going to change for your data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m31s)
01:47:31

[set and so if your new data set has very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m32s)
01:47:32

[different input averages it could really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m35s)
01:47:35

[cause a lot of problems so so yeah I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m36s)
01:47:36

[went through a period where I actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m40s)
01:47:40

[stopped normalizing my data and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m43s)
01:47:43

[things kind of worked but it's probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m46s)
01:47:46

[not worth it okay so so the rest of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m49s)
01:47:49

[is identical right all I've done is I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m55s)
01:47:55

[changed conf layer to BN layer but I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h47m58s)
01:47:58

[done one more thing which is I'm kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m02s)
01:48:02

[trying to get closer and closer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m04s)
01:48:04

[modern approaches which I've added a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m06s)
01:48:06

[single convolutional layer at the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m08s)
01:48:08

[with a bigger kernel size and a stride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m11s)
01:48:11

[of one why have I done that so the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m14s)
01:48:14

[idea is that I want my first layer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m19s)
01:48:19

[kind of have a richer input right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m23s)
01:48:23

[before my first layer had an input of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m26s)
01:48:26

[just three because there's just three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m28s)
01:48:28

[channels right but if I start with my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m29s)
01:48:29

[image right and and I kind of take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m32s)
01:48:32

[bigger area few different color I kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m41s)
01:48:41

[of take a bigger area right and I do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m46s)
01:48:46

[convolution using that bigger area in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m49s)
01:48:49

[this case I'm doing five by five right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m51s)
01:48:51

[then that kind of allows me to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h48m57s)
01:48:57

[find more interesting richer features in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m00s)
01:49:00

[that 5x5 area and so then I spin out a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m04s)
01:49:04

[bigger output this case I spit out a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m08s)
01:49:08

[filter size good about ten five by five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m11s)
01:49:11

[filters and so the idea is like pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m14s)
01:49:14

[much every state of the art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m17s)
01:49:17

[convolutional architecture now starts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m19s)
01:49:19

[out with a single con flare with like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m21s)
01:49:21

[five by five or seven by seven or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m25s)
01:49:25

[sometimes even like 11 by 11 convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m27s)
01:49:27

[with like quite a few filters you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m31s)
01:49:31

[something like you know thirty two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m36s)
01:49:36

[filters coming out and it's just just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m39s)
01:49:39

[way of kind of trying to and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m42s)
01:49:42

[because I use the straight of one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m44s)
01:49:44

[the padding of kernel size minus one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m46s)
01:49:46

[over two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m50s)
01:49:50

[it means that my outputs going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m50s)
01:49:50

[exactly the same size as my input but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m52s)
01:49:52

[just got more filters now this is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m55s)
01:49:55

[good way of trying to create a richer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h49m57s)
01:49:57

[starting point for my sequence of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m00s)
01:50:00

[convolutional layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m03s)
01:50:03

[okay so that's the basic theory of why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m04s)
01:50:04

[I've added this single convolution which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m08s)
01:50:08

[I just do once at the start and then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m10s)
01:50:10

[just go through all my layers and then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m12s)
01:50:12

[do my adaptive max pooling and my final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m14s)
01:50:14

[classifier okay so it's a minor tweak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m17s)
01:50:17

[but it helps right and so you'll see now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m20s)
01:50:20

[I kind of can go for a Moodle I have 60%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m24s)
01:50:24

[and after a couple is 45% now after a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m28s)
01:50:28

[couple that's 57% and after a few more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m34s)
01:50:34

[I'm out for 68% okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m36s)
01:50:36

[so you can see it's you know the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m38s)
01:50:38

[batch norm and you know tiny bit the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m40s)
01:50:40

[conveyor at the start it's helping now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m42s)
01:50:42

[what's more you can see this is still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m45s)
01:50:45

[increasing right so that's looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m46s)
01:50:46

[pretty encouraging okay so given that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m49s)
01:50:49

[this is looking pretty good an obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m52s)
01:50:52

[thing to try might be to see is to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h50m54s)
01:50:54

[increasing the depth of the model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m01s)
01:51:01

[now I can't just add more of most dried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m03s)
01:51:03

[to layers because remember how it half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m07s)
01:51:07

[the size of the image each time I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m10s)
01:51:10

[basically down to two by two at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m13s)
01:51:13

[right so I can't add much more so what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m14s)
01:51:14

[did instead was I said okay here's my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m18s)
01:51:18

[original layers so you must trade two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m21s)
01:51:21

[layers for everyone also create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m23s)
01:51:23

[straight one layer so astrayed one layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m26s)
01:51:26

[doesn't change the size and so now I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m29s)
01:51:29

[saying zip my stride two layers and my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m31s)
01:51:31

[stride one layers together and so first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m36s)
01:51:36

[of all do the straight too and then do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m38s)
01:51:38

[the straight one so this is now actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m41s)
01:51:41

[twice as deep okay so this is so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m43s)
01:51:43

[now twice as deep but I end up with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m50s)
01:51:50

[exact same you know two by two that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m53s)
01:51:53

[had before and so if I try this you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h51m56s)
01:51:56

[here after one two three four epochs is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m00s)
01:52:00

[at sixty-five percent after one two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m03s)
01:52:03

[three epochs I'm still at 65% it hasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m06s)
01:52:06

[helped right and so the reason it hasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m08s)
01:52:08

[helped is I'm now too deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m13s)
01:52:13

[even for batch norm two handlers now my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m17s)
01:52:17

[depth is now one two three four five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m20s)
01:52:20

[times two is ten eleven kampf 112 okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m23s)
01:52:23

[so 12 layers deep it's possible to train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m30s)
01:52:30

[a standard confident 12 layers deep but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m34s)
01:52:34

[it starts to get difficult to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m36s)
01:52:36

[properly right and it certainly doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m38s)
01:52:38

[seem to be really helping much if at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m40s)
01:52:40

[so that's where I'm instead going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m42s)
01:52:42

[replace this with a ResNet all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m45s)
01:52:45

[a rest net is our final stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m49s)
01:52:49

[what a resin it does is I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m51s)
01:52:51

[replace our BN layer right I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m55s)
01:52:55

[inherit from BN layer and replace our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h52m58s)
01:52:58

[forward with that and that's it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m00s)
01:53:00

[everything else is going to be identical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m04s)
01:53:04

[except now I'm going to do like way lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m06s)
01:53:06

[of layers I'm going to make it four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m09s)
01:53:09

[times deeper right and it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m11s)
01:53:11

[Train beautifully just because of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m13s)
01:53:13

[so why does that help so much so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m17s)
01:53:17

[called a ResNet block and as you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m22s)
01:53:22

[I'm saying that's not what I meant to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m25s)
01:53:25

[I'm saying my predictions equals my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m31s)
01:53:31

[input plus some function you know in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m36s)
01:53:36

[this case a convolution of my input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m40s)
01:53:40

[alright that's that's that's what I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m42s)
01:53:42

[written here and so I'm now going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m44s)
01:53:44

[shuffle that around a little bit and I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m48s)
01:53:48

[going to say I'm going to say f of X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h53m53s)
01:53:53

[equals y minus X ok so there's the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m00s)
01:54:00

[thing shuffled around right that's my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m06s)
01:54:06

[prediction within the previous layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m09s)
01:54:09

[right and so what this is then doing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m11s)
01:54:11

[it's trying to fit a function to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m16s)
01:54:16

[difference between these two right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m19s)
01:54:19

[so the difference is actually the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m22s)
01:54:22

[residual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m28s)
01:54:28

[so if this is what I'm trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m35s)
01:54:35

[calculate my actual Y value and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m41s)
01:54:41

[the thing that I've most recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m44s)
01:54:44

[calculated then the difference between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m46s)
01:54:46

[the two is basically the error in terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m48s)
01:54:48

[of what I've calculated so far and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m51s)
01:54:51

[this is therefore saying that okay try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m54s)
01:54:54

[to find a set of convolutional weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m56s)
01:54:56

[that attempts to fill in the the amount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h54m59s)
01:54:59

[I was off by so in other words if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m04s)
01:55:04

[let's clear this out if we have some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m08s)
01:55:08

[inputs coming in right and then we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m13s)
01:55:13

[this function which is basically trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m16s)
01:55:16

[to predict the error it's like how much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m18s)
01:55:18

[are we off by right and then we add that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m21s)
01:55:21

[on so we basically add on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m25s)
01:55:25

[additional like prediction of how much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m27s)
01:55:27

[will be wrong by and then we add on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m29s)
01:55:29

[another prediction of how much were we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m31s)
01:55:31

[wrong by that time and add on another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m33s)
01:55:33

[prediction of how much we wrong by that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m35s)
01:55:35

[time then that each time we're kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m37s)
01:55:37

[zooming in getting closer and closer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m40s)
01:55:40

[our correct answer and each time we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m44s)
01:55:44

[saying like okay we've got to a certain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m46s)
01:55:46

[point but we still got an error you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m48s)
01:55:48

[still got a residual so let's try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m51s)
01:55:51

[create a model that just predicts that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m53s)
01:55:53

[residual and add that on to our previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m56s)
01:55:56

[model and then let's build another model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h55m58s)
01:55:58

[that predicts the residual and add that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m00s)
01:56:00

[on to our previous model and if we keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m02s)
01:56:02

[doing that again and again we should get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m04s)
01:56:04

[closer and closer to our answer and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m06s)
01:56:06

[is based on a theory called boosting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m10s)
01:56:10

[which people that have done some machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m14s)
01:56:14

[learning will certainly come across](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m16s)
01:56:16

[right and so basically the trick here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m17s)
01:56:17

[that by specifying that as being the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m20s)
01:56:20

[thing that we're trying to calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m30s)
01:56:30

[then we kind of get boosting for free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m36s)
01:56:36

[right it's like because we couldn't just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m39s)
01:56:39

[juggle that around to show that actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m41s)
01:56:41

[it's just calculating a model on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m44s)
01:56:44

[wrist Jill so that's kind of amazing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m47s)
01:56:47

[you know it totally works as you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m53s)
01:56:53

[here I've now got my standard batch norm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m56s)
01:56:56

[layer okay which is something which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h56m59s)
01:56:59

[going to reduce my size by two because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m02s)
01:57:02

[it's got the stride too and then I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m05s)
01:57:05

[got a resident layers dried one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m07s)
01:57:07

[another resident layer astride one right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m08s)
01:57:08

[and sorry I think I said that was four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m11s)
01:57:11

[of these is actually three of these so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m13s)
01:57:13

[this is now three times deeper I zipped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m15s)
01:57:15

[through all of those and so I've now got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m17s)
01:57:17

[a function of a function of a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m19s)
01:57:19

[so three layers per group and then my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m22s)
01:57:22

[con at the start and my linear at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m26s)
01:57:26

[end so this is now three times bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m29s)
01:57:29

[than my original and if I fit it you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m32s)
01:57:32

[see it's just keeps going up and up and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m37s)
01:57:37

[up and up I keep fitting it more he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m39s)
01:57:39

[going up and up and it's still going up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m41s)
01:57:41

[when I kind of got bored okay so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m45s)
01:57:45

[rest net has been a really important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m49s)
01:57:49

[development and it's allowed us to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m54s)
01:57:54

[create these really deep networks right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h57m58s)
01:57:58

[now the full risk net does not quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m03s)
01:58:03

[look the way I've described it here the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m06s)
01:58:06

[full res net doesn't just have one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m09s)
01:58:09

[convolution right but it actually has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m11s)
01:58:11

[two convolutions right so the way people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m14s)
01:58:14

[normally draw resident blocks is they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m16s)
01:58:16

[normally say you've got some input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m19s)
01:58:19

[coming in to the layer it goes through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m21s)
01:58:21

[one convolution to convolutions and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m26s)
01:58:26

[gets added back to the original input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m31s)
01:58:31

[right that's the full version of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m35s)
01:58:35

[ResNet block in my case I've just done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m37s)
01:58:37

[one convolution okay and then you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m40s)
01:58:40

[also in every block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m43s)
01:58:43

[right one of them it's actually the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m47s)
01:58:47

[first one does he it's actually the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m52s)
01:58:52

[first one here is not a resident block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m56s)
01:58:56

[but a standard convolution with a stride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h58m59s)
01:58:59

[of two right this is called a bottleneck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m04s)
01:59:04

[layer right and the idea is this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m07s)
01:59:07

[a ResNet block so from time to time we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m09s)
01:59:09

[actually change the geometry right we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m12s)
01:59:12

[doing this trade to in resident we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m14s)
01:59:14

[actually use just a standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m17s)
01:59:17

[convolutional layer there's actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m19s)
01:59:19

[different form of bottleneck block that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m21s)
01:59:21

[I'm not going to picture in this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m23s)
01:59:23

[I'm going to teach you in part two okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m25s)
01:59:25

[but as you can see even this somewhat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m27s)
01:59:27

[simplified version of a resin it still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m29s)
01:59:29

[works pretty well and so we can make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m31s)
01:59:31

[a little bit bigger all right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m35s)
01:59:35

[here I've just increased all of my sizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m38s)
01:59:38

[I have still got my three and also I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m41s)
01:59:41

[had it drop out right so at this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m45s)
01:59:45

[I'm gonna say this is other than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m47s)
01:59:47

[minor simplification of ResNet you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m49s)
01:59:49

[a reasonable approximation of a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m52s)
01:59:52

[starting point for a modern architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m54s)
01:59:54

[okay and so now I've added in my point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=01h59m56s)
01:59:56

[to drop out I've increased the size here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m00s)
02:00:00

[and if I train this you know I can treat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m02s)
02:00:02

[it for a while it's going pretty well I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m06s)
02:00:06

[can then add in gta at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m08s)
02:00:08

[eventually I get 85% and you know this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m09s)
02:00:09

[is at a point now where like literally I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m13s)
02:00:13

[wrote this whole notebook in like three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m16s)
02:00:16

[hours right we can like create this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m17s)
02:00:17

[thing in three hours and this is like an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m19s)
02:00:19

[accuracy that in kind of 2012-2013 was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m22s)
02:00:22

[considered pretty much data the art for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m26s)
02:00:26

[say pocket right so this is actually no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m29s)
02:00:29

[this is actually pretty damn good to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m32s)
02:00:32

[you know nowadays the most recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m35s)
02:00:35

[results are like 97% you know there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m37s)
02:00:37

[there's plenty of room we can still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m40s)
02:00:40

[improve but they're all based on these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m42s)
02:00:42

[techniques like there isn't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m44s)
02:00:44

[anything you know when we start looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m46s)
02:00:46

[in in part to it like how to get this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m49s)
02:00:49

[right up to state of the art you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m52s)
02:00:52

[it's basically better approaches to data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m53s)
02:00:53

[augmentation better approaches to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m55s)
02:00:55

[regularization some tweaks on ResNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h00m57s)
02:00:57

[but it's all basically the circuit okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m01s)
02:01:01

[so so is the residual training on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m04s)
02:01:04

[residual method is that only looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m09s)
02:01:09

[it's a generic thing that can be applied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m13s)
02:01:13

[non image problems oh great question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m16s)
02:01:16

[yeah yes it is but it's like being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m19s)
02:01:19

[ignored everywhere else in NLP something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m22s)
02:01:22

[called the transformer architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m25s)
02:01:25

[recently appeared and you know was shown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m28s)
02:01:28

[to be the state of the art for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m31s)
02:01:31

[translation and it's got like a simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m32s)
02:01:32

[resonance structure you know first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m36s)
02:01:36

[I've ever seen it in NLP I haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m38s)
02:01:38

[really seen anybody else take advantage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m40s)
02:01:40

[of it yeah this general approach we call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m42s)
02:01:42

[these skip connections this idea of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m45s)
02:01:45

[skipping over a layer and kind of doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m47s)
02:01:47

[an identity it's yeah it's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m49s)
02:01:49

[appearing a lot in computer vision and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m52s)
02:01:52

[nobody else much seems to be using it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m54s)
02:01:54

[even though there's nothing computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m56s)
02:01:56

[vision specific about it so I think it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h01m57s)
02:01:57

[a big opportunity okay so final stage I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m00s)
02:02:00

[want to show you is how to use an extra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m05s)
02:02:05

[feature of Pi torch to do something cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m09s)
02:02:09

[and it's going to be a kind of a segue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m12s)
02:02:12

[into part two it's going to be our first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m14s)
02:02:14

[little hint as to what else we can build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m17s)
02:02:17

[on these neural nets and so and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m20s)
02:02:20

[also going to take us all the way back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m23s)
02:02:23

[to lesson 1 which is we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m24s)
02:02:24

[dogs and cats ok so going all the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m26s)
02:02:26

[back to dogs and cats we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m29s)
02:02:29

[create a resin at 34 ok so these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m32s)
02:02:32

[different ResNet 3450 101 they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m34s)
02:02:34

[they're basically just different numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m38s)
02:02:38

[of different sized blocks it's like how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m42s)
02:02:42

[many of these kind of pieces do you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m46s)
02:02:46

[before it bottleneck block and then how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m48s)
02:02:48

[many of these sets of super blocks do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m50s)
02:02:50

[you have right that's all these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m53s)
02:02:53

[different numbers mean so if you look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m54s)
02:02:54

[the torch vision source code you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h02m56s)
02:02:56

[actually see the definition of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m00s)
02:03:00

[different resonates you'll see they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m01s)
02:03:01

[all just different parameters right ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m03s)
02:03:03

[so we're going to use rest at 34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m09s)
02:03:09

[and so we're going to do this a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m11s)
02:03:11

[bit more by hand okay so if this is my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m13s)
02:03:13

[architecture this is just the name of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m17s)
02:03:17

[function then I can call it to get that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m19s)
02:03:19

[model right and then true look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m22s)
02:03:22

[definition is do I want the pre-trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m25s)
02:03:25

[so in other words is it going to load in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m27s)
02:03:27

[the pre-trained imagenet weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m29s)
02:03:29

[okay so M now contains a model and so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m31s)
02:03:31

[can take a look at it like so okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m36s)
02:03:36

[so you can see here what's going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m39s)
02:03:39

[right is that inside here I've got my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m41s)
02:03:41

[initial two deconvolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m47s)
02:03:47

[and here is that kernel size of seven by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m49s)
02:03:49

[seven okay and interestingly in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m52s)
02:03:52

[case it actually starts out with a seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m54s)
02:03:54

[by seven strobe - okay there's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m56s)
02:03:56

[padding that we talked about to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h03m58s)
02:03:58

[sure that we don't lose the edges all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m00s)
02:04:00

[right there's our batch naught okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m02s)
02:04:02

[there's our Lu you get the idea right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m04s)
02:04:04

[Kong and then so here you can now see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m07s)
02:04:07

[there's a layer that contains a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m10s)
02:04:10

[blocks all right so here's a block which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m13s)
02:04:13

[contains a cons fetch norm rally you con](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m16s)
02:04:16

[Bethnal you can't see it printed but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m19s)
02:04:19

[after this is where it does the addition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m22s)
02:04:22

[all right so there's like a whole ResNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m24s)
02:04:24

[block and then another resident block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m26s)
02:04:26

[and then another ResNet block okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m28s)
02:04:28

[then you can see also sometimes you see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m33s)
02:04:33

[one where there's a stripe - right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m38s)
02:04:38

[here's actually one of these bottleneck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m40s)
02:04:40

[layers okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m44s)
02:04:44

[so you can kind of see how this is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m47s)
02:04:47

[is structure so in our case sorry I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m49s)
02:04:49

[skipped over this a little bit but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m53s)
02:04:53

[approach that we ended up using for real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h04m59s)
02:04:59

[you was to put it before our before our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m04s)
02:05:04

[Bashan on which see what they do here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m12s)
02:05:12

[we've got fetch norm railing you cons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m18s)
02:05:18

[that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m24s)
02:05:24

[no I'm really okay okay so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m25s)
02:05:25

[the order that they're using it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m26s)
02:05:26

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m27s)
02:05:27

[and you'll find like there's two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m29s)
02:05:29

[different versions of ResNet in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m31s)
02:05:31

[there's three different versions of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m33s)
02:05:33

[ResNet floating around the one which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m34s)
02:05:34

[actually turns out to be the best it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m37s)
02:05:37

[called the pre-act ResNet which has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m39s)
02:05:39

[different ordering again but you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m41s)
02:05:41

[look it up it's basically a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m47s)
02:05:47

[order of where the value and where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m48s)
02:05:48

[batch norm yeah okay so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m50s)
02:05:50

[start with a standard resident 34 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m53s)
02:05:53

[normally what we do is we need to now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h05m57s)
02:05:57

[turn this into something that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m01s)
02:06:01

[predict dogs versus class right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m02s)
02:06:02

[currently the final layer has a thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m06s)
02:06:06

[features because imagenet has a thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m10s)
02:06:10

[features right so we need to get rid of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m12s)
02:06:12

[this so when you use confer owner from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m14s)
02:06:14

[pre-trained in fast AI it actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m19s)
02:06:19

[deletes this layer for you and it also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m22s)
02:06:22

[deletes this layer and something that as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m25s)
02:06:25

[far as I know is unique to fast AI is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m30s)
02:06:30

[replace this see this is an average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m33s)
02:06:33

[pooling layer of size seven by seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m35s)
02:06:35

[right so this is the basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m37s)
02:06:37

[adaptive pooling layer but whoever wrote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m39s)
02:06:39

[this didn't know about adaptive pooling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m41s)
02:06:41

[so they manually said oh I know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m43s)
02:06:43

[meant to be seven by seven so in first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m45s)
02:06:45

[AI we replaced this with adaptive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m47s)
02:06:47

[pooling but we actually do both adaptive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m49s)
02:06:49

[average pooling and adaptive max pooling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m51s)
02:06:51

[and we then concatenate them two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m54s)
02:06:54

[together which it's it is something we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h06m56s)
02:06:56

[invented but at the same time we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m00s)
02:07:00

[invented it somebody wrote a paper about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m02s)
02:07:02

[it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m03s)
02:07:03

[so it's you know we don't get any credit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m04s)
02:07:04

[but I think we're the only library that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m06s)
02:07:06

[provides it and certainly only one that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m08s)
02:07:08

[does it by default we're going to for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m09s)
02:07:09

[the purpose of this exercise though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m14s)
02:07:14

[we're going to do a simple version where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m15s)
02:07:15

[we delete the last two layers so we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m17s)
02:07:17

[grab all the children of the model will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m19s)
02:07:19

[delete the last two layers and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m21s)
02:07:21

[instead we're going to add a convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m24s)
02:07:24

[which just has two outputs right I'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m27s)
02:07:27

[show you why in a moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m32s)
02:07:32

[right then we're going to do our average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m33s)
02:07:33

[pooling and then we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m36s)
02:07:36

[soft mess okay so that's a model which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m39s)
02:07:39

[is going to have you'll see that there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m43s)
02:07:43

[is no this one has a fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m46s)
02:07:46

[layer at the end this one does not have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m48s)
02:07:48

[a fully connected layer yet but if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m50s)
02:07:50

[think about it this convolutional layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m53s)
02:07:53

[is going to be two filters only right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h07m55s)
02:07:55

[and it's going to be two by seven by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m01s)
02:08:01

[seven and so once we then do the average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m03s)
02:08:03

[pooling it's going to end up being just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m06s)
02:08:06

[two numbers that it produces so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m09s)
02:08:09

[a different way of producing just two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m11s)
02:08:11

[numbers I'm not going to say it's better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m13s)
02:08:13

[it's going to say it's different okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m15s)
02:08:15

[but there's a reason we do it I'll show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m16s)
02:08:16

[you the reason we can now train this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m19s)
02:08:19

[model in the usual way right so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m21s)
02:08:21

[say transform stock model image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m23s)
02:08:23

[classifier data from paths and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m26s)
02:08:26

[can use that Kampf learner from model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m29s)
02:08:29

[data we just learnt about I'm now going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m30s)
02:08:30

[to freeze every single layer except for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m34s)
02:08:34

[that one and this is the fourth last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m38s)
02:08:38

[layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m41s)
02:08:41

[so we'll say freeze to minus four right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m41s)
02:08:41

[and so this is just training the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m44s)
02:08:44

[layer okay so we get 99.1 percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m46s)
02:08:46

[accuracy so that you know this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m49s)
02:08:49

[approaches working fine and here's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m50s)
02:08:50

[we can do though we can now do something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m53s)
02:08:53

[called fast comm last activated Maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h08m56s)
02:08:56

[fast activation is what we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m02s)
02:09:02

[do is we're going to try to look at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m06s)
02:09:06

[particular cat and we're going to use a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m08s)
02:09:08

[technique called class activation Maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m11s)
02:09:11

[where we take our model and we ask you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m13s)
02:09:13

[which parts of this image turned out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m16s)
02:09:16

[be important and when we do this it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m19s)
02:09:19

[going to feed out this is got the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m22s)
02:09:22

[picture it's going to create alright and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m24s)
02:09:24

[so as you can see here it's found the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m26s)
02:09:26

[cat so how did it do that well the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m28s)
02:09:28

[it did that will kind of work backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m32s)
02:09:32

[is to produce this matrix now you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m33s)
02:09:33

[in this matrix there's some pretty big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m38s)
02:09:38

[numbers around about here which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m41s)
02:09:41

[correspond to our cat so what is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m44s)
02:09:44

[matrix this matrix is simply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m48s)
02:09:48

[or to the value of this feature matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h09m52s)
02:09:52

[times this py vector the py vector is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m00s)
02:10:00

[simply equal to the predictions which in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m05s)
02:10:05

[this case said I am 100% confident it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m09s)
02:10:09

[a cat right so this is just equal to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m11s)
02:10:11

[value of if I just call the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m14s)
02:10:14

[passing in our cat this is our cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m17s)
02:10:17

[that's an X then we got our predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m20s)
02:10:20

[right so it's just the value of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m23s)
02:10:23

[predictions so py is just the value of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m24s)
02:10:24

[our predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m27s)
02:10:27

[what about feet what's that equal to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m27s)
02:10:27

[feet is equal to the values in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m30s)
02:10:30

[layer right in other words the value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m38s)
02:10:38

[that comes out of the final in facts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m40s)
02:10:40

[come out of this ladder coming out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m42s)
02:10:42

[the final convolutional layer right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m43s)
02:10:43

[it's actually the seven by seven by two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m46s)
02:10:46

[and so you can see here let's see feet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m50s)
02:10:50

[the shape of features is two filters by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m54s)
02:10:54

[seven by seven right so the idea is if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h10m58s)
02:10:58

[we multiply that vector by that tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m03s)
02:11:03

[right then it's going to end up grabbing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m09s)
02:11:09

[all of the first channel because that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m12s)
02:11:12

[a 1 and none of the second channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m15s)
02:11:15

[because that's a 0 and so therefore it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m17s)
02:11:17

[going to return the value of the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m21s)
02:11:21

[convolutional layer for the for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m23s)
02:11:23

[section which lines up with being a cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m28s)
02:11:28

[but if you think about it this the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m30s)
02:11:30

[section lines up with being a cat the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m33s)
02:11:33

[second section lines up with being a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m36s)
02:11:36

[so if we multiply that tensor by that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m37s)
02:11:37

[tensor we end up with this matrix and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m41s)
02:11:41

[this matrix is which parts most like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m45s)
02:11:45

[cat or to put it another way in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m50s)
02:11:50

[model the only thing that happened after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m53s)
02:11:53

[the convolutional layer was an average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m56s)
02:11:56

[pooling layer so the average pooling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h11m59s)
02:11:59

[layer talked that 7x7 grid and said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m01s)
02:12:01

[average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m04s)
02:12:04

[how much each part is cat Lake that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m05s)
02:12:05

[answered my final value my final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m08s)
02:12:08

[prediction was the average cattiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m10s)
02:12:10

[there's the whole thing right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m13s)
02:12:13

[because it had to be able to average out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m17s)
02:12:17

[these things to get the average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m19s)
02:12:19

[cattiness that means I could then just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m20s)
02:12:20

[take this matrix and resize it to be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m23s)
02:12:23

[same size as my original cat and just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m28s)
02:12:28

[overlay it on top you get this heat map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m30s)
02:12:30

[right so the way you can use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m33s)
02:12:33

[technique at home is to basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m35s)
02:12:35

[calculate this matrix right on some like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m39s)
02:12:39

[really you've got some really big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m41s)
02:12:41

[picture you can calculate this matrix on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m43s)
02:12:43

[a quick small little cognate and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m46s)
02:12:46

[zoom into the bit that has the highest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m48s)
02:12:48

[value and then rerun it just on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m51s)
02:12:51

[part that so it's like oh this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m54s)
02:12:54

[area that seems to be the most like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m57s)
02:12:57

[hat or most like a dog that zoom in to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h12m58s)
02:12:58

[that bit right so I skipped over that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m01s)
02:13:01

[pretty quickly because we ran out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m05s)
02:13:05

[time and so we'll be learning more about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m06s)
02:13:06

[these kind of approaches in part two and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m10s)
02:13:10

[we can talk about it more on the forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m12s)
02:13:12

[and hopefully you get the idea the one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m13s)
02:13:13

[thing that totally skipped over was how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m15s)
02:13:15

[do we actually ask for that particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m18s)
02:13:18

[layer okay and I'll let you read about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m21s)
02:13:21

[this during the week but basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m23s)
02:13:23

[there's a thing called a hook so we said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m25s)
02:13:25

[we called save features which is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m31s)
02:13:31

[little class that we wrote that goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m35s)
02:13:35

[register forward hook and basically a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m37s)
02:13:37

[forward hook is a special PI torch thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m40s)
02:13:40

[that every time it calculates a layer it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m42s)
02:13:42

[runs this function it's like a callback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m45s)
02:13:45

[basically it's like a callback that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m48s)
02:13:48

[happens every time it calculates a layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m50s)
02:13:50

[and so in this case it just saved the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m52s)
02:13:52

[value of the particular layer that I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m55s)
02:13:55

[interested in okay and so that way I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h13m59s)
02:13:59

[able to go inside here and grab those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m02s)
02:14:02

[features out look after I was done okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m04s)
02:14:04

[so I call save features that gives me my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m10s)
02:14:10

[pork and then later on I can just grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m13s)
02:14:13

[the value that I saved okay so I skipped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m15s)
02:14:15

[over that pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m18s)
02:14:18

[quickly but if you look in the pipe or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m19s)
02:14:19

[docks they have some more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m20s)
02:14:20

[and help about that yes Jeremy can you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m22s)
02:14:22

[spend five minutes talking about your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m28s)
02:14:28

[journey into deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m31s)
02:14:31

[yeah and finally how can we keep up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m34s)
02:14:34

[important research that is important to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m39s)
02:14:39

[practice sure yeah so it's gonna that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m42s)
02:14:42

[good I think I'll close more on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m46s)
02:14:46

[latter bit which is like what now okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m47s)
02:14:47

[so for those of you are interested you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m50s)
02:14:50

[should aim to come back for part two if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m55s)
02:14:55

[you're aiming to come back for part two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m57s)
02:14:57

[how many people would like to come back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h14m59s)
02:14:59

[to part two okay that's not bad I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m00s)
02:15:00

[almost everybody so if you want to come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m02s)
02:15:02

[back to part two be aware of this by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m05s)
02:15:05

[that time you're expected to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m08s)
02:15:08

[mastered all of the techniques we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m10s)
02:15:10

[learnt in part one and there's plenty of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m12s)
02:15:12

[time between now and then okay even if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m14s)
02:15:14

[you haven't done much or any ml before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m16s)
02:15:16

[but it does assume that you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m18s)
02:15:18

[be working you know at the same level of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m20s)
02:15:20

[intensity for now until then that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m23s)
02:15:23

[have been with practicing right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m25s)
02:15:25

[practicing so generally speaking the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m27s)
02:15:27

[people who did well in part two last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m30s)
02:15:30

[year had watched each of the videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m32s)
02:15:32

[about three times right and some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m34s)
02:15:34

[people actually I knew had actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m36s)
02:15:36

[discovered they learnt some of them off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m39s)
02:15:39

[by heart by mistake so they're like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m40s)
02:15:40

[watching the video is again is helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m42s)
02:15:42

[and make sure you get to the point that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m44s)
02:15:44

[you can recreate the notebooks without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m45s)
02:15:45

[watching the videos all right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m48s)
02:15:48

[other men make more interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m50s)
02:15:50

[obviously try and recreate them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m51s)
02:15:51

[notebooks using different data sets you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m53s)
02:15:53

[know and definitely then just keep up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h15m57s)
02:15:57

[with the forum and you'll see people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h16m00s)
02:16:00

[keep on posting more stuff about recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h16m01s)
02:16:01

[papers and recent advances and over the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h16m04s)
02:16:04

[next couple of months you'll find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3g26EVADgY#t=02h16m07s)
02:16:07
