okay so welcome back to deep learning
00:00:00.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m00s

lesson 2 last week we got to the point
00:00:03.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m03s

where we had successfully trained a
00:00:10.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m10s

pretty accurate image classifier and so
00:00:12.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m12s

just to remind you about how we did that
00:00:16.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m16s

can you guys see okay I think the
00:00:21.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m21s

actually we can turn the phone once all
00:00:24.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m24s

right
00:00:25.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m25s

can you guys all see the screen okay we
00:00:26.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m26s

can to adjust these ones can we some
00:00:30.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m30s

pictures all into darkness but if that
00:00:35.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m35s

works then is that okay that's better
00:00:37.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m37s

isn't it yeah can I dream the other two
00:00:41.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m41s

and maybe that one as well
00:00:46.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m46s

oh but that one oh that's great sorry I
00:00:47.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m47s

don't know your renders oh okay great
00:00:53.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m53s

that's better isn't it me so just to
00:00:55.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h00m55s

remind you the way that we built this
00:01:03.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m03s

image classifier was we used a small
00:01:05.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m05s

amount of code basically three lines of
00:01:08.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m08s

code and these three lines of code
00:01:11.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m11s

pointed at a particular path which
00:01:14.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m14s

already had some data in it and so the
00:01:17.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m17s

key thing for this to know how to train
00:01:19.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m19s

this model was that this path which was
00:01:21.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m21s

data dogs cats and had to have a
00:01:25.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m25s

particular structure which is that it
00:01:27.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m27s

had a train folder and a valid folder
00:01:30.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m30s

and in each of those trained and valid
00:01:33.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m33s

folders there was a cats folder in the
00:01:35.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m35s

dogs folder and if the cats on the docs
00:01:37.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m37s

folders was a bunch of images of cats
00:01:39.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m39s

and votes but this is like a pretty
00:01:42.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m42s

standard it's one of two main structures
00:01:44.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m44s

that are used to say here is the data
00:01:48.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m48s

that I want you to train an image model
00:01:51.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m51s

from so I know some of you during the
00:01:52.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m52s

week went away and tried different data
00:01:55.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m55s

sets where you had folders with
00:01:58.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h01m58s

different sets of images and in credit
00:02:01.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m01s

your own image classifiers and generally
00:02:02.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m02s

that seems to be working pretty well
00:02:05.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m05s

from what I can see on the forums so to
00:02:06.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m06s

make it clear at this point this is
00:02:08.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m08s

everything you need
00:02:11.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m11s

to get started so if you create your own
00:02:13.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m13s

folders with different sets of images
00:02:16.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m16s

you know a few hundred or a few thousand
00:02:18.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m18s

at each folder and run the same three
00:02:23.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m23s

lines of code that will give you an
00:02:28.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m28s

image classifier and you'll be able to
00:02:30.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m30s

see this third column tells you how
00:02:32.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m32s

accurate is so we looked at some kind of
00:02:35.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m35s

simple visualizations to see like what
00:02:42.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m42s

was it uncertain about what was it wrong
00:02:46.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m46s

about and so forth and that's always a
00:02:48.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m48s

really good idea and then we learned
00:02:50.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m50s

about the one key number you have to
00:02:55.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m55s

pick so this is this number here is the
00:02:57.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m57s

one key number is 0.01 and this is
00:02:59.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h02m59s

called the learning rate and so I wanted
00:03:02.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m02s

to go over this again and we'll learn
00:03:05.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m05s

about the theory behind what this is
00:03:07.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m07s

during the rest of the course in quite a
00:03:10.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m10s

lot of detail and for now I just wanted
00:03:12.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m12s

to talk about the practice yes you know
00:03:14.459
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m14s

they cannot see you in the medium
00:03:23.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m23s

turnout I just turned it around you tell
00:03:25.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m25s

us about the other three numbers being
00:03:31.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m31s

bad we did these three here we're going
00:03:34.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m34s

to talk about the other other ones
00:03:38.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m38s

shortly so the main one we're going to
00:03:40.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m40s

look at for now is is the last column
00:03:41.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m41s

which is the accuracy the first column
00:03:43.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m43s

as you can see is the epoch number so
00:03:48.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m48s

this tells us how many times has it been
00:03:50.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m50s

through the entire dataset trying to
00:03:52.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m52s

learn a better classifier and in the
00:03:55.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m55s

next two columns is what's called the
00:03:57.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m57s

loss which we'll be learning about
00:03:58.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h03m58s

either later today or next week the
00:04:00.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m00s

first point is the loss on the training
00:04:03.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m03s

set these are the images that we're
00:04:05.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m05s

looking at in order to try to make a
00:04:07.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m07s

better classifier and the second is the
00:04:08.459
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m08s

loss of the validation set these are the
00:04:10.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m10s

images that we're not looking at and
00:04:12.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m12s

we're training but we're just sitting on
00:04:14.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m14s

the side to see how accurate we are so
00:04:15.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m15s

we'll learn about littering loss in
00:04:17.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m17s

accuracy later
00:04:19.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m19s

okay so so we've got the epoch number
00:04:24.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m24s

the training loss is the second column
00:04:30.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m30s

the validation loss is the third column
00:04:33.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m33s

and the accuracy is the fourth column
00:04:36.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m36s

you
00:04:40.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m40s

okay so the basic idea of the loading
00:04:44.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m44s

rate so the basic idea of the learning
00:04:48.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m48s

rate is it's the thing that's going to
00:04:56.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m56s

decide how quickly do we zoom do we kind
00:04:58.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h04m58s

of hone in on the solution and so I find
00:05:01.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m01s

that a good way to think about this is
00:05:05.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m05s

to think about like well what if we were
00:05:06.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m06s

trying to fit to a function that looks
00:05:08.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m08s

something like this right we're trying
00:05:13.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m13s

to say okay where's where abouts is the
00:05:15.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m15s

minimum point this is basically what we
00:05:17.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m17s

do when we do deep learning is we try to
00:05:20.459
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m20s

find the minimum point of a function now
00:05:23.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m23s

our function happens to have millions or
00:05:26.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m26s

hundreds of millions of parameters but
00:05:29.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m29s

it works the same basic way and so when
00:05:30.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m30s

we look at it you know we can
00:05:32.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m32s

immediately see that the lowest point is
00:05:33.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m33s

here but how would you do that if you
00:05:36.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m36s

are a computer algorithm and what we do
00:05:40.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m40s

is we we start out at some point at
00:05:42.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m42s

random so you pick say here and we have
00:05:45.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m45s

a look and we say okay what's the what's
00:05:47.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m47s

the loss or the error at this point and
00:05:50.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m50s

we say what's the gradient in other
00:05:52.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m52s

words which way is up and which way is
00:05:53.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m53s

down and it tells us that down is going
00:05:55.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m55s

to be in that direction and it also
00:05:58.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h05m58s

tells us how fast is it going down which
00:06:00.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m00s

is at this point is going down pretty
00:06:03.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m03s

quickly and so then we take a step in
00:06:05.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m05s

the direction that's down and the
00:06:09.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m09s

distance we travel is going to be
00:06:11.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m11s

proportional to the gradient sort of
00:06:13.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m13s

unfortunately how steep it is the idea
00:06:15.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m15s

is if it's deeper then we're probably
00:06:17.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m17s

further away that's the general idea
00:06:20.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m20s

right and so specifically what we do is
00:06:22.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m22s

we take the gradient which is how steep
00:06:25.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m25s

is it at this point and we multiply it
00:06:26.879
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m26s

by some number and that number is called
00:06:28.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m28s

the learning rate okay
00:06:30.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m30s

so if we pick a number that is very
00:06:31.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m31s

small then we're guaranteed that we're
00:06:35.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m35s

going to go a little bit closer and a
00:06:38.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m38s

little bit closer and a little bit
00:06:39.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m39s

closer each time right but it's going to
00:06:40.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m40s

take us a very long time to eventually
00:06:43.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m43s

get to the bottom if we dig a number
00:06:45.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m45s

that's very big we could actually step
00:06:48.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m48s

too far could go in the right direction
00:06:51.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m51s

but we could step all the way over to
00:06:53.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m53s

here right as
00:06:54.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m54s

result of which we end up further away
00:06:57.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m57s

than we started and we could oscillate
00:06:59.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h06m59s

and get worse and worse so if you start
00:07:01.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m01s

training a neural net and you find that
00:07:04.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m04s

your accuracy or your loss is like
00:07:06.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m06s

spitting off into infinity
00:07:08.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m08s

almost certainly your learning rates too
00:07:10.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m10s

high so in a sense learning rate too low
00:07:12.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m12s

is is a better problem to have because
00:07:17.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m17s

you're going to have to wait a long time
00:07:20.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m20s

but wouldn't it be nice if there was a
00:07:21.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m21s

way to figure out like what's the best
00:07:23.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m23s

learning rate something where you could
00:07:25.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m25s

kind of go quickly go like Bom Bom Bom
00:07:27.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m27s

right and so that's why we use this
00:07:30.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m30s

thing called a learning rate finder and
00:07:34.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m34s

what the learning rate finder does is it
00:07:36.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m36s

tries each each time it looks at another
00:07:39.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m39s

remember the mini-batch how many batches
00:07:41.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m41s

a few images that we look at each time
00:07:44.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m44s

so that we're using the parallel
00:07:46.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m46s

processing power of the GPU effectively
00:07:48.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m48s

we look generally at around 64 128
00:07:50.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m50s

images at a time for each mini batch
00:07:53.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m53s

which is labeled here as an iteration we
00:07:56.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m56s

gradually increase the learning rate
00:07:59.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h07m59s

multiplicatively increase the learning
00:08:01.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m01s

rate we started really really tiny
00:08:02.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m02s

learning rates to make sure that we
00:08:04.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m04s

don't start at something too high and we
00:08:06.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m06s

gradually increase it and so the idea is
00:08:09.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m09s

that eventually the learning rate will
00:08:11.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m11s

be so big that the loss will start
00:08:14.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m14s

getting worse
00:08:16.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m16s

and so what we're going to do then is
00:08:17.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m17s

we're a look at the plot of learning
00:08:19.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m19s

rate against loss right so when the
00:08:22.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m22s

learning rates tiny it increases slowly
00:08:25.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m25s

then it's that's where increase a bit
00:08:28.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m28s

faster and then eventually it starts not
00:08:29.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m29s

increasing as quickly and in fact it
00:08:33.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m33s

starts getting worse right so clearly
00:08:34.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m34s

here and make sure you're you want to be
00:08:36.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m36s

familiar with this scientific notation
00:08:38.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m38s

okay so ten to the negative one is 0.1
00:08:42.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m42s

10 to 50 or is 1 10 to the negative 2 is
00:08:45.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m45s

0.001 and when we write this in Python
00:08:48.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m48s

we'll generally write it like this
00:08:52.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m52s

rather than writing 10 to the negative 1
00:08:53.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m53s

or 10 to the negative 2 we'll just write
00:08:56.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m56s

1 a neg 1 or 1 e neg - okay I mean the
00:08:59.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h08m59s

same thing you're going to see that all
00:09:05.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m05s

the time and remember that equals 0.1
00:09:06.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m06s

Oh point O one okay so don't be confused
00:09:10.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m10s

by this text that it prints out here
00:09:19.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m19s

this this loss here is the the final
00:09:21.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m21s

loss at the very at the end of it's not
00:09:25.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m25s

of any interest right so ignore this
00:09:27.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m27s

this is only interesting when we're
00:09:29.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m29s

doing regular trading that's not
00:09:31.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m31s

interesting for the learning rate finder
00:09:32.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m32s

the thing that's interesting for the
00:09:34.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m34s

learning rate finder is this loan shed
00:09:35.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m35s

plot and specifically we're not looking
00:09:38.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m38s

for the point where it's the lowest back
00:09:41.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m41s

to the point where it's the lowest it's
00:09:43.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m43s

actually not getting better anymore so
00:09:44.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m44s

that's to higher learning rate so I
00:09:46.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m46s

generally look to see like where is it
00:09:47.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m47s

the lowest and then I go back like one
00:09:49.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m49s

for magnitude so one enoch two would be
00:09:51.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m51s

a pretty good choice yeah okay so that's
00:09:56.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m56s

why you saw when we ran our fit here we
00:09:59.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h09m59s

picked 0.01 right which is one a neg two
00:10:05.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m05s

so important point to make here is like
00:10:09.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m09s

this this is the one key number that
00:10:12.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m12s

we've learnt to adjust and if you just
00:10:15.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m15s

adjust this number at nothing else most
00:10:21.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m21s

of the time you're going to be able to
00:10:22.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m22s

get pretty good results and this is like
00:10:24.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m24s

a very different message to what you
00:10:26.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m26s

would hear or see in any textbook or any
00:10:28.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m28s

video or any course because up until now
00:10:31.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m31s

there's been like dozens and dozens of
00:10:35.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m35s

these they're called hyper parameters
00:10:38.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m38s

dozens and dozens of hyper parameters to
00:10:39.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m39s

set and they've been thought of as
00:10:41.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m41s

highly sensitive and difficult to set so
00:10:43.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m43s

inside the first AI library we kind of
00:10:45.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m45s

do all that stuff for you as much as we
00:10:48.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m48s

can and during the course we're going to
00:10:51.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m51s

learn that there are some more we can
00:10:53.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m53s

quake to get slightly better results but
00:10:55.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m55s

it's kind of like it's kind of in a
00:10:58.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h10m58s

funny situation here because for those
00:11:01.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m01s

of you that haven't done anything
00:11:03.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m03s

learning before is kind of like oh this
00:11:04.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m04s

is that's all there is to it this is
00:11:06.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m06s

very easy and then when you talk to
00:11:09.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m09s

people outside this class they'll be
00:11:10.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m10s

like deep learning so difficult as
00:11:12.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m12s

someone to say it's a real art form and
00:11:14.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m14s

so that's why there's this as is
00:11:16.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m16s

difference right and so that the truth
00:11:18.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m18s

is that the learning rate really is the
00:11:19.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m19s

key thing to set and this ability to use
00:11:21.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m21s

this
00:11:24.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m24s

to figure out how to set it well though
00:11:24.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m24s

the paper is now probably 18 months old
00:11:26.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m26s

almost nobody knows about this paper it
00:11:29.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m29s

was from a guy who's not from a famous
00:11:33.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m33s

research labs so most people kind of
00:11:35.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m35s

ignored it and in fact even this
00:11:36.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m36s

particular technique was one subpart of
00:11:38.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m38s

a paper that was about something else
00:11:40.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m40s

so again this idea of like this is how
00:11:42.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m42s

you can set the learning rate really
00:11:45.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m45s

nobody outside this classroom just about
00:11:47.689
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m47s

knows about it obviously the guy who
00:11:49.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m49s

wrote it Leslie Smith knows about it
00:11:51.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m51s

yeah so it's a good thing to tell your
00:11:53.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m53s

colleagues about is like here is
00:11:56.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m56s

actually a great way to set the learning
00:11:58.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h11m58s

rate and there's even been papers caught
00:12:00.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m00s

like one of the famous papers is called
00:12:03.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m03s

no more pesky learning rates which
00:12:04.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m04s

actually is a less effective technique
00:12:07.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m07s

than this one but this idea that like
00:12:09.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m09s

setting learning rates is is very
00:12:11.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m11s

difficult and thirdly is has been true
00:12:13.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m13s

for most of the kind of deep learning
00:12:15.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m15s

history so here's the trick right go
00:12:17.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m17s

look at this plot find kind of the
00:12:20.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m20s

lowest to go back about a multiple of
00:12:23.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m23s

ten and try that all right and if that
00:12:24.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m24s

doesn't quite work you can always try
00:12:28.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m28s

you know going back another multiple ten
00:12:29.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m29s

but this is always worked for me so far
00:12:31.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m31s

once why does this learning rate this
00:12:40.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m40s

method work versus something else like
00:12:43.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m43s

momentum base or what's like the
00:12:45.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m45s

advantages a disadvantage with just
00:12:47.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m47s

learning rate rate like technique we're
00:12:50.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m50s

just feels that's a great question so
00:12:52.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h12m52s

we're going to learn during this course
00:13:00.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m00s

about a number of ways of improving
00:13:02.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m02s

gradient percent like you mentioned
00:13:03.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m03s

momentum and atom and so forth this is
00:13:05.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m05s

orthogonal in fact so one of the things
00:13:08.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m08s

the faster a library tries to do is
00:13:10.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m10s

figure out the right gradient descent
00:13:13.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m13s

version and in fact behind the scenes
00:13:15.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m15s

this is actually using something called
00:13:17.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m17s

atom and so this technique is telling us
00:13:18.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m18s

this is the best learning rate to use
00:13:21.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m21s

given what I thought other tweaks you're
00:13:23.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m23s

using in this case the atom optimizer so
00:13:26.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m26s

it's not that there's some compromise
00:13:29.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m29s

between this and some other approaches
00:13:31.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m31s

who sits on top of those approaches and
00:13:32.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m32s

you still have to set the learning rate
00:13:34.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m34s

when you use with other approaches so
00:13:36.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m36s

we're trying to
00:13:38.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m38s

find the best kind of optimizer to use
00:13:38.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m38s

for a problem that you still have to set
00:13:41.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m41s

the learning rate and this is how we can
00:13:42.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m42s

do it and in fact this idea of using
00:13:44.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m44s

this technique on top of more advanced
00:13:46.459
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m46s

optimizers like Adam might haven't even
00:13:49.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m49s

seen mentioned in a paper before so I
00:13:50.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m50s

think this is like a I mean it's not a
00:13:52.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m52s

huge breakthrough it seems obvious but
00:13:54.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m54s

nobody else seems to tried it so as you
00:13:56.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m56s

can see it was well
00:13:59.629
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h13m59s

when we use optimizers like Adam ditched
00:14:05.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m05s

Harvick adaptive learning rate so and he
00:14:08.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m08s

said this learning rate is Italy initial
00:14:10.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m10s

learning rate because it changes during
00:14:12.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m12s

the people so we're going to be learning
00:14:14.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m14s

about things like Adam the details about
00:14:21.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m21s

it later in the class but the basic
00:14:24.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m24s

answer is no even with even the Adam
00:14:26.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m26s

that there actually is a learning rate
00:14:28.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m28s

it's just being it's being basically
00:14:29.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m29s

divided by the the gradient the average
00:14:35.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m35s

previous gradient and also the recent
00:14:39.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m39s

summer Squared's of gradients so there's
00:14:41.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m41s

still like a number called the learning
00:14:43.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m43s

rate there there isn't a even these so
00:14:45.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m45s

called dynamic learning rate methods
00:14:47.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m47s

still have unlearning rate okay so the
00:14:49.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h14m49s

most important thing that you can do to
00:15:00.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m00s

make your model better and is to give it
00:15:04.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m04s

more data so the challenge that happens
00:15:07.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m07s

is that these models have hundreds of
00:15:10.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m10s

millions of parameters and if you train
00:15:13.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m13s

them for a while they start to do what's
00:15:16.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m16s

called overfitting and so overfitting
00:15:19.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m19s

means that they're going to start to see
00:15:21.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m21s

like the specific details of the images
00:15:23.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m23s

you're giving them rather than the more
00:15:26.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m26s

general learning that can transfer
00:15:27.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m27s

across to the validation set so the best
00:15:31.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m31s

thing we can do to avoid overfitting is
00:15:34.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m34s

to find more data now obviously one way
00:15:36.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m36s

to do that would just be to collect more
00:15:39.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m39s

data from where you're getting it from
00:15:41.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m41s

or label more data but a really easy way
00:15:42.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m42s

that we should always do is to use
00:15:45.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m45s

something called data augmentation so
00:15:47.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m47s

they don't open tuition is one of these
00:15:51.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m51s

things that's key in many courses it's
00:15:53.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m53s

not even mentioned at all or if it is
00:15:55.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m55s

it's kind of like an advanced topic
00:15:57.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m57s

right at the end but actually it's like
00:15:58.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h15m58s

the most important thing that you can do
00:16:00.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m00s

to make a better model okay and so it's
00:16:03.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m03s

built into the faster you library to
00:16:05.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m05s

make it very easy to do and so we're
00:16:07.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m07s

going to look at the details of the code
00:16:08.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m08s

shortly but the basic idea is that
00:16:10.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m10s

as in our initial code we had a line
00:16:14.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m14s

that said image classified data from
00:16:19.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m19s

parts and we passed in the path to our
00:16:22.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m22s

data and for transforms we passed in
00:16:23.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m23s

basically the sizing the architecture
00:16:26.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m26s

we'll look at this in more detail
00:16:30.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m30s

shortly we just add one more parameter
00:16:31.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m31s

which is what kind of data augmentation
00:16:34.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m34s

do you want to do and so to understand
00:16:36.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m36s

data augmentation it's may be easiest to
00:16:41.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m41s

look at some pictures of data
00:16:43.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m43s

augmentation so what I've done here
00:16:44.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m44s

again we'll look at the code in more
00:16:47.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m47s

detail later but the basic idea is oh
00:16:48.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m48s

I've run I've built a data class like
00:16:50.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m50s

multiple times I'm going to do it six
00:16:56.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m56s

times and each time I'm going to plot
00:16:58.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h16m58s

the same catch and you can see that what
00:17:00.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m00s

happens is that this cap here is further
00:17:03.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m03s

over to the left this one here is
00:17:07.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m07s

further over to the right and this one
00:17:09.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m09s

here is fit horizontally and so forth so
00:17:10.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m10s

data augmentation different types of
00:17:13.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m13s

image you're going to want different
00:17:17.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m17s

types of data augmentation right so for
00:17:19.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m19s

example if you were trying to recognize
00:17:22.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m22s

letters and digits you wouldn't want to
00:17:25.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m25s

flip horizontally because like it's
00:17:27.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m27s

actually has a different meaning whereas
00:17:29.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m29s

on the other hand if you're looking at
00:17:31.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m31s

photos of cats and dogs you probably
00:17:33.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m33s

don't want to fit vertically because
00:17:36.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m36s

cats aren't generally upside down all
00:17:38.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m38s

right where else if you're looking at
00:17:40.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m40s

there's a current Cargill competition
00:17:42.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m42s

which is recognizing icebergs in
00:17:44.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m44s

satellite images you probably do want to
00:17:47.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m47s

fit them upside down because it's really
00:17:50.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m50s

matter which area around the iceberg or
00:17:52.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m52s

the satellite was right so one of the
00:17:54.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m54s

examples of the transform sets we have
00:17:58.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h17m58s

is transforms sidon so in other words if
00:18:00.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m00s

you have photos that are like generally
00:18:03.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m03s

taken from the side which generally
00:18:05.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m05s

means you want to be able to flip them
00:18:07.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m07s

horizontally but not vertically this is
00:18:08.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m08s

going to give you all the transforms you
00:18:10.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m10s

need for that so it'll flip them
00:18:12.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m12s

sideways rotate them by small amounts
00:18:13.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m13s

but not too much and slightly bury their
00:18:16.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m16s

contrast and brightness and slightly
00:18:19.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m19s

zoom in and out a little bit and move
00:18:22.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m22s

them around a little
00:18:24.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m24s

so each time it's a slightly different
00:18:25.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m25s

fight billionaires we're getting a
00:18:26.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m26s

couple of questions from people about
00:18:30.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m30s

you explaining in the reason why you
00:18:33.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m33s

don't think the minimum of the loss
00:18:36.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m36s

curve yeah but it's like the higher rate
00:18:38.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m38s

so yeah and also could you people
00:18:41.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m41s

understand if this works for every CNN
00:18:44.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m44s

for CNN every minute there's a running
00:18:48.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m48s

right fine done yeah exactly yeah okay
00:18:52.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m52s

great
00:18:58.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m58s

um could you put your hand up if there's
00:18:58.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h18m58s

a spare seat next to you so there was a
00:19:02.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m02s

question about the learning rate finder
00:19:11.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m11s

about why do we use the learning rate
00:19:13.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m13s

that's less than the lowest point and so
00:19:15.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m15s

the reason why is to understand what's
00:19:18.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m18s

going on with this learning rate finder
00:19:20.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m20s

so let's go back to our picture here
00:19:24.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m24s

like how do we figure out what learning
00:19:28.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m28s

rate to use right and so what we're
00:19:31.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m31s

going to do is we're going to take steps
00:19:33.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m33s

and each time we're going to double the
00:19:35.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m35s

learning rate so kind of double the
00:19:39.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m39s

amount by which we multiply the grander
00:19:41.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m41s

gradient so in other words would go tiny
00:19:43.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m43s

step slightly bigger slightly bigger
00:19:45.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m45s

slightly bigger slightly bigger slightly
00:19:47.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m47s

bigger slightly bigger okay and so the
00:19:51.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m51s

question is of the purpose of this is
00:19:57.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m57s

not to find the minimum the purpose of
00:19:59.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h19m59s

this is to figure out what learning rate
00:20:01.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m01s

is allowing us to decrease quickly right
00:20:03.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m03s

so the point at which the loss was
00:20:07.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m07s

lowest here is actually there right but
00:20:09.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m09s

that learning rate actually looks like
00:20:13.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m13s

it's probably too high it's going to
00:20:15.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m15s

just jump like probably backwards and
00:20:16.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m16s

forwards okay so instead what we do is
00:20:19.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m19s

we go back to the point where the
00:20:22.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m22s

learning rates quickly are giving us a
00:20:24.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m24s

quick increase in the loss so here is so
00:20:26.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m26s

here is the actual learning rate
00:20:33.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m33s

increasing every single time we look at
00:20:34.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m34s

a new mini batch
00:20:36.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m36s

so mini-batch reiteration versus
00:20:38.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m38s

learning right and then here is learning
00:20:40.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m40s

rate versus loss so here's that point at
00:20:42.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m42s

the bottom where is now already too high
00:20:44.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m44s

okay and so here's the point where we go
00:20:47.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m47s

back a little bit and it's increasing
00:20:49.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m49s

nice and quickly we're going to learn
00:20:51.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m51s

about something called stochastic
00:20:55.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m55s

gradient descent with restarts shortly
00:20:57.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m57s

where we're going to see like in a sense
00:20:59.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h20m59s

you might want to go back to 1 enoch 3
00:21:01.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m01s

where it's actually even steeper still
00:21:03.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m03s

and maybe we would actually find this
00:21:05.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m05s

book actually learn even quicker you
00:21:07.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m07s

could try it but we're going to see
00:21:11.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m11s

later why actually using a higher number
00:21:13.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m13s

is going to give us better
00:21:14.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m14s

generalization so for now let's put that
00:21:16.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m16s

aside do you mean higher learning rate
00:21:19.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m19s

when you say I know I mean higher
00:21:22.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m22s

letting retina say higher
00:21:24.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m24s

yeah yeah I mean I am learning rate so
00:21:25.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m25s

as we increase the iterations from the
00:21:31.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m31s

learning rate finder the learning rate
00:21:33.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m33s

is going up this is iterations versus
00:21:35.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m35s

learning ready okay so as we do that as
00:21:37.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m37s

the learning rate increases and we plot
00:21:41.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m41s

it here the loss Goes Down and here we
00:21:43.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m43s

get to the point where the learning rate
00:21:46.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m46s

is too high and at that point the most
00:21:47.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m47s

is now getting worse because I asked the
00:21:50.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m50s

question because you were just
00:21:52.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m52s

indicating that you know even though the
00:21:54.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m54s

minimum was at 10 to the minus 1 you
00:21:55.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m55s

were gonna you suggest that we should
00:21:58.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h21m58s

choose 10 to the minus 2 but now you're
00:22:00.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m00s

saying I mean we should go back the
00:22:03.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m03s

other way higher so I didn't mean to say
00:22:04.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m04s

that I'm sorry if I said something
00:22:07.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m07s

backwards I want to go back down to the
00:22:08.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m08s

lower learning rate so possibly I said a
00:22:11.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m11s

higher when I meant higher into this
00:22:14.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m14s

lower OS do you know I'm learning right
00:22:17.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m17s

okay thanks yep
00:22:19.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m19s

last class is said that the local all
00:22:22.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m22s

the local minima are the same and this
00:22:26.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m26s

graph also shows the same is that is
00:22:29.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m29s

this something that was observed or is
00:22:32.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m32s

the logic theory behind it that's not
00:22:33.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m33s

what this graph is showing this graph is
00:22:37.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m37s

simply showing that there's a point
00:22:40.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m40s

where if we increase the learning rate
00:22:41.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m41s

more then it stops getting better than
00:22:43.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m43s

actually starts getting worse the idea
00:22:46.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m46s

that all local minima are the same is a
00:22:48.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m48s

totally separate issue and it's actually
00:22:53.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m53s

something else we'll see a picture of
00:22:57.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m57s

shortly so let's come back to that
00:22:58.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h22m58s

Jeremy do we have to find the base
00:23:02.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m02s

learning rate every time we are going to
00:23:05.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m05s

run a poke third time we're running on a
00:23:08.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m08s

poke and a pop so how many times should
00:23:13.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m13s

I run this like let me write find my
00:23:15.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m15s

training that's a great question unit um
00:23:19.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m19s

I certainly run it once when I start
00:23:27.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m27s

later on in this class we're going to
00:23:31.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m31s

learn about unfreezing layers and after
00:23:34.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m34s

I unfreeze layers I sometimes run it
00:23:37.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m37s

again if I do something to like change
00:23:40.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m40s

the thing I'm training or change the way
00:23:42.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m42s

I'm training it you may want to run it
00:23:44.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m44s

again basically or you know if you
00:23:46.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m46s

particularly if you've changed something
00:23:50.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m50s

about how you train like unfreezing
00:23:51.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m51s

layers which we're gonna soon learn
00:23:54.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m54s

about and you're finding the other
00:23:55.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m55s

training is unstable or too slow
00:23:57.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h23m57s

well again you can run it again there's
00:24:01.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m01s

never any harm
00:24:03.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m03s

in running it it doesn't take very long
00:24:04.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m04s

that's great question okay so back to
00:24:07.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m07s

data augmentation so if we add to a when
00:24:11.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m11s

we run this little transforms from model
00:24:14.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m14s

function we pass in orientation
00:24:17.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m17s

transforms we can pass in the main to a
00:24:20.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m20s

transform side on or transforms top down
00:24:23.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m23s

later on we'll learn about creating your
00:24:26.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m26s

own custom transform lists as well but
00:24:28.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m28s

for now because we're taking pictures
00:24:31.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m31s

from the side cats and dogs will say
00:24:32.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m32s

transform side on and now each time we
00:24:35.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m35s

look at an image it's going to be zoomed
00:24:38.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m38s

in or out a little bit moved around a
00:24:41.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m41s

little bit
00:24:42.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m42s

rotated a little bit possibly flipped
00:24:43.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m43s

okay and so what this does is it's not
00:24:47.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m47s

exactly creating new data but as far as
00:24:50.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m50s

the convolutional neural net is
00:24:53.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m53s

concerned it's a different way of
00:24:55.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m55s

looking at this thing and it actually
00:24:57.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m57s

therefore allows it to learn how to
00:24:59.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h24m59s

recognize cats or dogs from somewhat
00:25:02.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m02s

different angles right so when we do
00:25:06.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m06s

data orientation we're basically trying
00:25:07.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m07s

to say based on our domain knowledge
00:25:09.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m09s

here here are different ways that we can
00:25:12.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m12s

mess with this image that we know still
00:25:15.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m15s

make it the same image you know and that
00:25:18.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m18s

we could expect that you might actually
00:25:20.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m20s

see that kind of image in the real world
00:25:22.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m22s

so what we can do now is when we call
00:25:25.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m25s

this from parts function which we'll
00:25:28.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m28s

learn more about shortly we can now pass
00:25:31.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m31s

in this set of transforms which actually
00:25:33.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m33s

have these augmentations in now
00:25:35.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m35s

so that's going to we're going to start
00:25:41.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m41s

from scratch here we do a fit and
00:25:42.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m42s

initially the augmentations actually
00:25:47.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m47s

don't do anything and the reason
00:25:51.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m51s

initially they don't do anything is
00:25:53.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m53s

because we've got here something that
00:25:55.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m55s

says precompute equals true we're going
00:25:56.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m56s

to come back to these lots of times but
00:25:59.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h25m59s

basically what this is doing is do you
00:26:03.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m03s

remember this picture we saw where we
00:26:06.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m06s

learn each different layer has these
00:26:08.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m08s

activations that basically look for it
00:26:11.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m11s

or anything from the middle of flowers
00:26:13.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m13s

to eyeballs of birds or whatever right
00:26:16.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m16s

and so literally what happens is that
00:26:21.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m21s

the the later layers of this
00:26:25.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m25s

convolutional neural network have these
00:26:28.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m28s

things called activations and activation
00:26:30.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m30s

literally it's a number an activation is
00:26:32.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m32s

a number that says this feature like
00:26:34.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m34s

eyeball of bird is in this location with
00:26:38.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m38s

this level of confidence with its
00:26:42.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m42s

probability right and so we're going to
00:26:44.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m44s

see a lot of this later but what we can
00:26:46.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m46s

do is we can say all right well in this
00:26:50.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m50s

we've got a pre trained network remember
00:26:52.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m52s

and a pre trained network is one where
00:26:55.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m55s

it's already learned to recognize
00:26:57.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m57s

certain things in this case it's learnt
00:26:58.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h26m58s

to recognize the one and a half million
00:27:00.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m00s

images in the imagenet dataset and so
00:27:02.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m02s

what we could do is we could take the
00:27:05.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m05s

the second last layer so the one which
00:27:07.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m07s

is like got all of the information
00:27:10.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m10s

necessary to figure out what kind of
00:27:12.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m12s

thing a thing is and we can save those
00:27:14.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m14s

activations so basically saving things
00:27:17.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m17s

saying you know there's this level of
00:27:19.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m19s

eyeball nurse here in this level of dogs
00:27:21.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m21s

facing us here or in this level of
00:27:24.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m24s

fluffy ear there and so forth and so we
00:27:25.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m25s

save for every image these activations
00:27:29.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m29s

and that we call them the pre computed
00:27:32.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m32s

activations and so the idea is now that
00:27:35.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m35s

when we want to create a new classifier
00:27:38.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m38s

which can basically take advantage of
00:27:41.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m41s

these pre computed applications we can
00:27:43.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m43s

just very quickly train when all the
00:27:46.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m46s

details there shortly we can very
00:27:48.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m48s

quickly train a simple linear model
00:27:50.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m50s

based on those
00:27:52.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m52s

and so that's what happens when we say
00:27:54.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m54s

pre-compute equals true and that's why
00:27:55.879
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m55s

you may have noticed this week the first
00:27:58.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h27m58s

time that you run a model a new model it
00:28:01.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m01s

takes a minute or two where else you saw
00:28:05.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m05s

when I ran it it took like five or ten
00:28:08.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m08s

seconds took you a minute or two and
00:28:10.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m10s

that's because it had to pre-compute
00:28:12.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m12s

these activations and just has to do
00:28:14.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m14s

that once if you're using like your own
00:28:16.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m16s

computer or AWS it just has to do it
00:28:19.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m19s

once ever if you're using Kressel it
00:28:21.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m21s

actually has to do it once every single
00:28:24.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m24s

time you rerun press all because press
00:28:28.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m28s

or uses are just for these pre computed
00:28:30.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m30s

activations it uses a special that all
00:28:33.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m33s

had a scratch space that disappears each
00:28:35.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m35s

time you restart your press or instance
00:28:37.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m37s

so other than the special case of cresol
00:28:39.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m39s

generally speak he does have to run at
00:28:42.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m42s

once
00:28:44.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m44s

ever for a data set okay so the issue
00:28:44.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m44s

with that is that since we pre computed
00:28:50.629
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m50s

for each image you know how much does it
00:28:53.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m53s

have an EI here and how much does it
00:28:56.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m56s

have a lizard's eyeball there and so
00:28:57.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h28m57s

forth that means that data augmentations
00:29:00.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m00s

don't work right in other words even
00:29:02.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m02s

though we're trying to show at a
00:29:04.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m04s

different version of the cat each time
00:29:05.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m05s

we've pre computed the activations for a
00:29:07.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m07s

particular version of that cat so in
00:29:09.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m09s

order to use data augmentation we just
00:29:13.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m13s

have to go and learn pre compute equals
00:29:15.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m15s

false okay and then we can run a few
00:29:17.629
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m17s

more APIs right and so you can see here
00:29:20.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m20s

that as we run more a Potts the accuracy
00:29:25.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m25s

isn't particularly getting better that's
00:29:29.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m29s

the bad news
00:29:31.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m31s

the good news is that you can see that
00:29:32.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m32s

the train loss practices like the way of
00:29:35.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m35s

measuring the error of this model
00:29:39.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m39s

although that's getting better the
00:29:40.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m40s

errors going down the validation error
00:29:42.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m42s

isn't going down and but we're not
00:29:45.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m45s

overfitting and overfitting would mean
00:29:48.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m48s

that the training loss is much lower
00:29:50.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m50s

than the validation loss and we're going
00:29:53.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m53s

to talk about that a lot during this
00:29:56.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m56s

course but the general idea here is if
00:29:57.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h29m57s

you're doing much better job on the
00:30:00.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m00s

training set then you are on the
00:30:02.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m02s

validation set that means your models
00:30:04.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m04s

not generalize
00:30:06.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m06s

so we're not at that point which is good
00:30:07.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m07s

but we're not really improving so we're
00:30:10.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m10s

going to have to figure out how to deal
00:30:14.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m14s

with that before we do I want to show
00:30:15.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m15s

you one other cool trick I've added here
00:30:19.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m19s

cycle length equals one and this is
00:30:21.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m21s

another really interesting idea here's
00:30:25.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m25s

the basic idea
00:30:29.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m29s

cycle length equals one enables a recent
00:30:30.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m30s

fairly recent discovery and deep
00:30:33.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m33s

learning called stochastic gradient
00:30:35.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m35s

descent with restarts and the basic idea
00:30:37.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m37s

is this as you as you get closer and
00:30:40.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m40s

closer as you get closer and closer to
00:30:45.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m45s

the right spot right now getting closer
00:30:49.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m49s

and closer I may want to start to
00:30:52.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m52s

decrease my learning rate right because
00:30:55.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m55s

as I get closer I'm kind of like oh I'm
00:30:57.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m57s

pretty close down so let's let's slow
00:30:59.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h30m59s

down my steps to try to get executive
00:31:01.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m01s

the right spot right and so as we do
00:31:04.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m04s

more iterations
00:31:08.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m08s

our learning rate perhaps should
00:31:12.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m12s

actually go down right because as we go
00:31:15.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m15s

along we're getting closer and closer to
00:31:19.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m19s

where we want to be and we want to like
00:31:20.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m20s

get exactly to the right spot okay so
00:31:22.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m22s

the idea of decreasing the learning rate
00:31:25.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m25s

as you train is called
00:31:27.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m27s

learning rate annealing and it's it's
00:31:29.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m29s

very very common very very popular
00:31:33.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m33s

everybody uses it basically all the time
00:31:36.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m36s

the most common kind of learning rate
00:31:39.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m39s

annealing is really horrendously hacky
00:31:41.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m41s

it's basically that researchers like
00:31:45.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m45s

pick a learning rate that seems to work
00:31:47.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m47s

for a while and then when it stops
00:31:49.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m49s

learning well they drop it down by about
00:31:51.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m51s

10 times and then they keep learning a
00:31:53.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m53s

bit more until it doesn't seem to be
00:31:55.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m55s

improving and they drop it down by
00:31:56.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m56s

another ten times that's what most
00:31:58.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h31m58s

academic research papers and most people
00:32:00.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m00s

in industry do so this would be like
00:32:02.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m02s

stepwise annealing very manual very
00:32:04.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m04s

annoying a better approach is simply to
00:32:07.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m07s

pick some kind of functional form like a
00:32:11.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m11s

line it turns out that a really good
00:32:14.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m14s

functional form is one half of the
00:32:17.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m17s

cosine curve
00:32:19.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m19s

right and the reason why is that for a
00:32:22.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m22s

while when you're not very close you
00:32:25.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m25s

kind of have a really high learning rate
00:32:27.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m27s

and that is you do get close you kind of
00:32:29.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m29s

quickly drop down and do a few
00:32:31.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m31s

iterations with a really low learning
00:32:33.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m33s

rate and so this is called cosine
00:32:35.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m35s

annealing so to those of you who haven't
00:32:37.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m37s

done trigonometry for a while
00:32:40.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m40s

cosine basically looks something like
00:32:41.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m41s

this right so we've picked one little
00:32:44.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m44s

half piece okay so we're going to use
00:32:47.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m47s

cosine annealing but here's the thing
00:32:52.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m52s

when you're in a very high dimensional
00:32:56.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h32m56s

space right near we're only able to show
00:33:00.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m00s

three dimensions right but in reality
00:33:02.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m02s

we've got hundreds of millions of
00:33:05.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m05s

dimensions we've got lots of different
00:33:06.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m06s

fairly flat points there no not the
00:33:10.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m10s

actual local minima but they're fairly
00:33:13.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m13s

flat points all of which are pretty good
00:33:14.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m14s

right but they might differ in a really
00:33:17.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m17s

interesting way which is that some of
00:33:20.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m20s

those flat points let me show you
00:33:22.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m22s

let's imagine we've got a surface that
00:33:32.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m32s

looks something like this
00:33:35.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m35s

right now imagine that where you kind of
00:33:40.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m40s

random guest started here and our
00:33:43.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m43s

initial therefore kind of learning rate
00:33:47.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m47s

annealing schedule got us down to here
00:33:49.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m49s

now indeed that's a pretty nice low
00:33:51.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m51s

error right but it probably doesn't
00:33:55.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m55s

generalize very well which is to say if
00:33:57.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h33m57s

we use a different data set where things
00:34:00.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m00s

are just kind of slightly different in
00:34:02.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m02s

one of these directions suddenly is a
00:34:04.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m04s

terrible solution right where else over
00:34:07.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m07s

here is basically equally good in terms
00:34:10.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m10s

of loss right but it rather suggests
00:34:13.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m13s

that if you move if you have slightly
00:34:16.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m16s

different data sets that are slightly
00:34:18.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m18s

moved in different directions it's still
00:34:19.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m19s

going to be good right so in other words
00:34:21.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m21s

we would expect this solution here is
00:34:23.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m23s

probably going to generalize better than
00:34:25.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m25s

this by key one so here's what we do is
00:34:29.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m29s

we've got like a bunch of different low
00:34:33.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m33s

bits right then our standard loading
00:34:35.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m35s

rate annealing approach will start of go
00:34:39.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m39s

down here or downhill downhill downhill
00:34:41.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m41s

downhill to one spot right but what we
00:34:43.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m43s

could do instead is use a learning rate
00:34:47.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m47s

schedule that looks like this which is
00:34:49.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m49s

to say we do a cosign annealing and then
00:34:54.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m54s

suddenly jump up again into a cosign
00:34:56.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m56s

annealing and then jump up again
00:34:58.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m58s

and so each time we jump up it means
00:34:59.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h34m59s

that if they're going to spiky bit and
00:35:02.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m02s

then we subtly increase the learning
00:35:04.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m04s

rate and it jumps now all the way over
00:35:06.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m06s

to here and so then we kind of learning
00:35:08.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m08s

right in your learning right near death
00:35:10.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m10s

down to here and then we jump up again
00:35:11.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m11s

to a high learning rate oh and it stays
00:35:13.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m13s

here right so in other words each time
00:35:16.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m16s

we jump up the learning rate that means
00:35:19.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m19s

that if it's in a nasty spiky part of
00:35:21.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m21s

the surface it's going to hop out of the
00:35:24.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m24s

spiky part and hopefully if we do that
00:35:26.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m26s

enough times it'll eventually find a
00:35:28.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m28s

nice smooth Bowl
00:35:30.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m30s

could you get the same effect by running
00:35:40.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m40s

multiple iterations through the
00:35:42.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m42s

different ground of my starting point so
00:35:44.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m44s

that eventually you explore all possible
00:35:46.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m46s

minimize yeah so in fact that that's a
00:35:48.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m48s

great question and before this approach
00:35:52.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m52s

which is called stochastic gradient
00:35:59.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h35m59s

descent with restarts was was created
00:36:01.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m01s

that's exactly what people used to do
00:36:05.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m05s

they used to create these things called
00:36:07.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m07s

ensembles where they would basically
00:36:08.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m08s

relearn a whole new model ten times in
00:36:11.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m11s

the hope that one of them's like but it
00:36:15.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m15s

ended up being better and so the cool
00:36:17.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m17s

thing about this decosta gradient
00:36:22.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m22s

descent with restarts is that the model
00:36:24.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m24s

once we're in a reasonably good spot
00:36:26.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m26s

each time we jump up the learning rate
00:36:29.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m29s

it doesn't restart it actually hangs out
00:36:30.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m30s

in this nice part part of the space and
00:36:34.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m34s

then keeps getting better so
00:36:36.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m36s

interestingly it turns out that this
00:36:37.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m37s

approach where we do this a bunch of
00:36:39.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m39s

separate cosine annealing steps we end
00:36:42.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m42s

up with a better result as then if we
00:36:45.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m45s

just randomly try it a few different
00:36:49.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m49s

starting points so it's a super neat
00:36:50.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m50s

trick and it's a fairly recent
00:36:54.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m54s

development but and again almost
00:36:58.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h36m58s

nobody's heard of it but I found like
00:37:00.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m00s

it's now like my superpower like using
00:37:04.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m04s

this along with the learning rate finder
00:37:07.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m07s

like I can get better results than
00:37:10.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m10s

nearly anybody like in a casual
00:37:14.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m14s

competition you know in the first week
00:37:16.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m16s

or two I can like jump in it's been an
00:37:18.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m18s

arrow to and back I've got a
00:37:20.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m20s

fantastically good result and so this is
00:37:23.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m23s

why I didn't pick the point where it's
00:37:26.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m26s

got the steepest slope I actually trying
00:37:29.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m29s

to pick something kind of aggressively
00:37:31.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m31s

high it's still getting down but maybe
00:37:33.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m33s

like getting to the point where it's
00:37:35.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m35s

nearly too high not because I want to
00:37:36.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m36s

make sure because that's because when we
00:37:39.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m39s

do this stochastic gradient descent with
00:37:40.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m40s

restarts this ten to the negative two
00:37:43.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m43s

represents the
00:37:46.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m46s

a highest number that it uses so it goes
00:37:48.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m48s

up to ten to the negative two and then
00:37:51.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m51s

goes down and then up to ten negative
00:37:54.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m54s

two and down so if I use to lower
00:37:56.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m56s

learning rate it's not going to jump to
00:37:58.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h37m58s

a different part of the function so I
00:38:01.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m01s

have a few questions but the first one
00:38:06.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m06s

is how many times do you change your
00:38:08.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m08s

learning rate you want to work we don't
00:38:10.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m10s

change the learning rate all three how
00:38:13.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m13s

many times - okay so in terms of this
00:38:15.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m15s

part here where it's going down we
00:38:17.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m17s

change the learning rate every single
00:38:19.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m19s

mini - all right and then the number of
00:38:20.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m20s

times we reset it is set by the cycle
00:38:23.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m23s

length parameter and so 1 means reset it
00:38:27.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m27s

up to every epoch so if I had to there
00:38:30.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m30s

it would reset it up to every to epochs
00:38:33.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m33s

and interestingly this this point that
00:38:36.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m36s

when we do the learning rate and
00:38:38.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m38s

kneeling that we actually change it
00:38:39.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m39s

every single batch it turns out to be
00:38:41.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m41s

really critical to making this work and
00:38:43.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m43s

it again is very different to what
00:38:47.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m47s

nearly everybody in industry in academia
00:38:48.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m48s

has done before
00:38:50.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m50s

what do you get a chance could you
00:38:52.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m52s

explain recompute it was true because
00:38:54.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m54s

it's still yeah we're going to come back
00:38:58.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h38m58s

to that multiple times in this course so
00:39:02.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m02s

the way this course has been a work is
00:39:04.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m04s

we're going to like do a really
00:39:06.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m06s

high-level version of each thing and
00:39:07.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m07s

then we're going to like come back to it
00:39:09.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m09s

in two or three lessons and then come
00:39:11.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m11s

back to it at the end of the course and
00:39:12.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m12s

each time we're going to see like more
00:39:14.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m14s

of the math more of the code and get a
00:39:15.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m15s

deeper view okay and we can talk about
00:39:18.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m18s

it also in the forums during the week
00:39:20.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m20s

our main goal is to generalize and we
00:39:26.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m26s

don't want to get those like narrow
00:39:29.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m29s

demas yeah that's a it's a very short
00:39:31.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m31s

summary this method are we keeping track
00:39:34.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m34s

off to minimize and averaging them ah
00:39:37.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m37s

that's that's another level of
00:39:40.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m40s

sophistication and indeed you can see
00:39:44.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m44s

there's something here called snapshot
00:39:45.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m45s

ensemble so we're not doing it in the
00:39:47.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m47s

code right now but yes if you wanted to
00:39:50.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m50s

make us generalize even better you can
00:39:53.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m53s

save the weights here and here and here
00:39:55.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m55s

and then take the average
00:39:58.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h39m58s

ishes but for now we're just going to
00:40:00.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m00s

pick the last one if you want to skip
00:40:03.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m03s

ahead if you want to skip ahead there's
00:40:10.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m10s

a parameter called cycle safe name which
00:40:16.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m16s

you can add as well as cycle them and
00:40:19.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m19s

that will save a set of weights at the
00:40:21.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m21s

end of every learning rate cycle and
00:40:23.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m23s

then you can ensemble them ok so we've
00:40:26.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m26s

got a pretty decent model here ninety
00:40:35.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m35s

nine point three percent accuracy and
00:40:38.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m38s

we've gone through of you know a few
00:40:41.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m41s

steps that is taken you know a minute or
00:40:42.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m42s

two to run and so from time to time I
00:40:44.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m44s

tend to save my weight so if you go
00:40:47.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m47s

learn dot save and then pass in a file
00:40:49.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m49s

name it's going to go ahead and save
00:40:51.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m51s

that for you later on if you go learn
00:40:53.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m53s

load you'll be straight back to where
00:40:55.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m55s

you came from okay so it's a good idea
00:40:57.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h40m57s

to do that from time to time this is a
00:41:00.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m00s

good time to mention what happens when
00:41:03.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m03s

you do this when you go learn dot save
00:41:06.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m06s

when you create precomputed activations
00:41:10.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m10s

another thing we learn about soon when
00:41:12.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m12s

you create resized images these are all
00:41:14.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m14s

creating various temporary files okay
00:41:16.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m16s

and so what happens is if we go to data
00:41:20.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m20s

and we go to dogs cats this is my data
00:41:28.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m28s

folder and you'll see there's a folder
00:41:34.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m34s

here called TMP or - and so this is
00:41:36.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m36s

automatically created and all of my pre
00:41:41.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m41s

computed activations end up in here I
00:41:43.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m43s

mention this because if if things are if
00:41:46.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m46s

you're getting weird errors that might
00:41:50.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m50s

be because you've got some Oh pre
00:41:52.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m52s

computed activations like we're only
00:41:54.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m54s

half completed or are in some way
00:41:56.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m56s

incompatible with what you're doing so
00:41:59.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h41m59s

you can always go ahead and just delete
00:42:01.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m01s

this TMP this temporary directory and
00:42:03.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m03s

see if that causes your error to go away
00:42:05.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m05s

this is the faster I equivalent of
00:42:08.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m08s

turning it off and then on again
00:42:10.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m10s

you'll also see there's a directory
00:42:12.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m12s

called models and that's where all of
00:42:14.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m14s

these when you say dot save with a model
00:42:16.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m16s

that's where that's going to go actually
00:42:19.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m19s

it reminds me when the stochastic
00:42:22.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m22s

gradient descent with restarts paper
00:42:23.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m23s

came out I saw a tweet that was somebody
00:42:25.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m25s

was like Oh to make your deep learning
00:42:27.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m27s

work better turn it off and then on
00:42:29.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m29s

again question it so if I want to see I
00:42:30.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m30s

want to retrain my model fuselage again
00:42:38.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m38s

do I just do everything the 10 folder if
00:42:40.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m40s

you want if you want to train your model
00:42:43.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m43s

from scratch there's generally no reason
00:42:51.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m51s

to delete the pre computed activations
00:42:54.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m54s

because the pre computed activations are
00:42:56.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m56s

without any training that's what the pre
00:42:59.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h42m59s

trained model created with the with the
00:43:02.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m02s

weights that you downloaded off the
00:43:06.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m06s

internet the only yeah I mean the only
00:43:07.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m07s

reason you want to delete the pre
00:43:12.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m12s

computed activations is that there was
00:43:14.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m14s

some error caused by like half creating
00:43:15.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m15s

them and crashing or some something like
00:43:18.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m18s

that as you change the size of your
00:43:20.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m20s

import change different architectures
00:43:23.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m23s

and so forth they all create different
00:43:25.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m25s

sets of activations with different file
00:43:26.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m26s

names so you don't generally you
00:43:28.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m28s

shouldn't have to worry about it if you
00:43:30.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m30s

want to start training again from
00:43:32.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m32s

scratch all you have to do is create a
00:43:33.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m33s

new learn object so each time you go
00:43:35.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m35s

like conch learner dot pre-trained that
00:43:40.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m40s

creates a new object with with new sets
00:43:42.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m42s

of weights fever train from okay so
00:43:45.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m45s

before our break we'll finish off by
00:43:50.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m50s

talking about about fine-tuning and
00:43:52.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m52s

differential learning rates and so so
00:43:56.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h43m56s

far everything we've done has not
00:44:00.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m00s

changed any of these free trained
00:44:05.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m05s

filters right so we've used a pre
00:44:08.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m08s

trained model that already knows how to
00:44:09.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m09s

find at the early stages edges
00:44:12.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m12s

ingredients and then corners and curves
00:44:17.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m17s

and then repeating patterns and bits of
00:44:21.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m21s

text
00:44:26.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m26s

and eventually eyeballs right we have
00:44:26.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m26s

not retrained any of those activations
00:44:30.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m30s

any of those features well specifically
00:44:35.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m35s

any of those weights in the
00:44:38.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m38s

convolutional kernels all we've done is
00:44:40.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m40s

we've learnt some new layers that we've
00:44:43.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m43s

added on top of these things we've
00:44:46.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m46s

learned how to mix and match these
00:44:48.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m48s

pre-trained features now obviously it
00:44:50.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m50s

may turn out that your pictures have you
00:44:54.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m54s

know different kinds of eyeballs or
00:44:58.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h44m58s

faces or if you're using different kinds
00:45:00.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m00s

of images like satellite images totally
00:45:03.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m03s

different kinds of features altogether
00:45:05.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m05s

right so if you're like training to
00:45:07.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m07s

recognize icebergs you'll probably want
00:45:10.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m10s

to go all the way back and learn you
00:45:12.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m12s

know all the way back to kind of
00:45:15.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m15s

different combinations of these simple
00:45:16.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m16s

gradients and edges in our cases dogs
00:45:18.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m18s

vs. cats we're going to have some minor
00:45:22.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m22s

differences but we still may find it's
00:45:24.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m24s

helpful to slightly tune some of these
00:45:26.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m26s

later layers as well so to tell the
00:45:29.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m29s

learner that we now want to start
00:45:34.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m34s

actually changing the convolutional
00:45:36.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m36s

filters themselves we simply say
00:45:38.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m38s

unfreeze okay so a frozen layer is a
00:45:41.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m41s

layer which is not trained is not
00:45:44.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m44s

updated okay so unfreeze unfreezes all
00:45:46.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m46s

of the layers now when you think about
00:45:49.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m49s

it it's pretty obvious that layer one
00:45:51.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m51s

right which is like a diagonal edge or a
00:45:56.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m56s

gradient probably doesn't need to change
00:45:59.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h45m59s

by much if at all right from the 1 and a
00:46:02.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m02s

half million images on image net it
00:46:05.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m05s

probably already is figured out pretty
00:46:06.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m06s

well how to find like edges of gradients
00:46:08.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m08s

it probably already knows also like
00:46:10.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m10s

which kind of corners to look for and
00:46:13.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m13s

how to find which kinds of curves and so
00:46:15.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m15s

forth so in other words these early
00:46:17.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m17s

layers probably need little if any
00:46:19.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m19s

learning where else these later ones are
00:46:22.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m22s

much more likely to need more learning
00:46:26.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m26s

and this is universally true regardless
00:46:28.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m28s

of whether you're looking for satellite
00:46:30.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m30s

images of rainforests or icebergs or
00:46:32.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m32s

whether you're looking for cats versus
00:46:34.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m34s

dogs right
00:46:36.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m36s

so what we do is we create an array of
00:46:38.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m38s

learning rates where we say okay these
00:46:41.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m41s

are the learning rates to use for our
00:46:45.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m45s

additional layers that we've added on
00:46:47.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m47s

top these are the learning rates to use
00:46:50.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m50s

in the middle few layers and these are
00:46:53.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m53s

the learning rates to use for the first
00:46:56.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m56s

few layers so these are the ones for the
00:46:58.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h46m58s

layers that represent like very basic
00:47:00.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m00s

geometric features these are the ones
00:47:02.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m02s

that are used to for the more complex
00:47:05.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m05s

kind of sophisticated convolutional
00:47:08.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m08s

features and these are the ones that are
00:47:11.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m11s

used for the features that we've added
00:47:13.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m13s

and went from stretch right so you can
00:47:14.689
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m14s

create a array of learning rates and
00:47:17.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m17s

then when we called up fit and pass an
00:47:19.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m19s

array of learning rates it's now going
00:47:22.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m22s

to use those different learning rates
00:47:24.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m24s

for different parts of the model this is
00:47:25.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m25s

not something that we've like invented
00:47:30.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m30s

but I'd also say it's like it's so not
00:47:34.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m34s

that common that it doesn't even have a
00:47:37.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m37s

name as far as I know so we're going to
00:47:39.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m39s

call it differential learning rates if
00:47:42.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m42s

it actually has a name or indeed if
00:47:46.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m46s

somebody's actually written a paper
00:47:48.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m48s

specifically talking about it I don't
00:47:49.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m49s

know there's a great researcher called
00:47:51.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m51s

Jason your Sinskey who who did write a
00:47:54.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m54s

paper about the kind of the idea that
00:47:56.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m56s

you might want different learning rates
00:47:58.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m58s

and showing why but I don't think any
00:47:59.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h47m59s

other libraries support it and yeah I
00:48:02.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m02s

don't know of a name for it having said
00:48:05.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m05s

that though this ability to like
00:48:07.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m07s

unfreeze and then use these differential
00:48:10.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m10s

learning rates I found it's like the
00:48:12.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m12s

secret to taking a pretty good model and
00:48:14.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m14s

putting it into an awesome model so just
00:48:17.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m17s

to clarify so you have three numbers
00:48:25.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m25s

there okay three hyper parameters the
00:48:29.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m29s

first one is the photo late model so the
00:48:32.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m32s

mall that are late layers the so with
00:48:36.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m36s

the it's your answer is many many right
00:48:41.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m41s

and they're kind of in groups and we're
00:48:44.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m44s

going to learn about the architecture
00:48:46.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m46s

this is called a ResNet for residual
00:48:47.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m47s

network
00:48:49.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m49s

it kind of has ResNet blocks and so what
00:48:50.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m50s

we're doing is we're grouping the blocks
00:48:53.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m53s

into three groups and so this one is
00:48:54.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m54s

actually this first number is for the
00:48:58.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h48m58s

earliest layers yeah they're ones
00:49:00.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m00s

closest to the pixels that represent
00:49:04.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m04s

like corners and edges and gradients but
00:49:06.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m06s

why why do you well I thought those
00:49:09.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m09s

layers are frozen at first so yeah right
00:49:12.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m12s

so we just said unfreeze the streets
00:49:15.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m15s

also we so yeah I'm freezing them
00:49:17.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m17s

because you have kind of partially
00:49:19.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m19s

trained although lately we've trained
00:49:20.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m20s

we've trained our added layers yes now
00:49:24.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m24s

you are we training the Oh step exactly
00:49:26.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m26s

obviously so it waits and the learning
00:49:28.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m28s

rate is particularly small for the early
00:49:30.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m30s

layers that's right because you just
00:49:33.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m33s

find a want to find food yeah yeah we
00:49:34.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m34s

probably don't want to change them at
00:49:37.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m37s

all but you know if it does need to then
00:49:39.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m39s

it can thanks no problem so using the
00:49:42.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m42s

differential in rates a little different
00:49:50.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m50s

from like grid search there's no
00:49:51.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m51s

similarity to grid search so grid search
00:49:56.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m56s

is where we're trying to find the best
00:49:58.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h49m58s

hyper parameter for something so for
00:50:00.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m00s

example you could kind of think of the
00:50:03.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m03s

learning rate finder as a really
00:50:07.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m07s

sophisticated grid search which is like
00:50:09.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m09s

trying lots and lots of learning rates
00:50:11.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m11s

to find which one is best
00:50:12.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m12s

but this has nothing to do with that
00:50:15.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m15s

this is actually for the entire training
00:50:16.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m16s

from now on it's actually going to use a
00:50:18.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m18s

different learning rate for each layer
00:50:20.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m20s

and so I was wondering so you give a pre
00:50:28.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m28s

train model then you have to use the
00:50:33.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m33s

same input dimensions right because I
00:50:35.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m35s

was thinking okay let's say you have
00:50:39.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m39s

this big they use like big machines to
00:50:40.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m40s

train these things and you want to take
00:50:43.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m43s

advantage of it how would you go about
00:50:45.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m45s

you know you have like images that are
00:50:46.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m46s

like bigger than the ones that they used
00:50:48.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m48s

or we're going to be talking about sizes
00:50:50.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m50s

later but the short answer is that with
00:50:52.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m52s

this library and the modern
00:50:54.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m54s

architectures were using we can use any
00:50:56.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m56s

size we like so did I mean do we need
00:50:58.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h50m58s

can we at least just a specific layer we
00:51:04.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m04s

can we're not doing it yet but if you
00:51:08.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m08s

wanted to you can learn dot freeze
00:51:09.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m09s

underscore two and pass into layer
00:51:12.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m12s

number much to my surprise or at least
00:51:14.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m14s

initial my surprise it turns out I
00:51:21.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m21s

almost never need to do that I almost
00:51:23.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m23s

never find it helpful and I think it's
00:51:26.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m26s

because we're using differential
00:51:28.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m28s

learning rates the the optimizer can
00:51:29.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m29s

kind of learn just as much as it needs
00:51:33.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m33s

to so yeah it's a little data like very
00:51:35.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m35s

little data yeah it still doesn't seem
00:51:45.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m45s

to help the one place I have found it
00:51:49.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m49s

helpful is if I'm using like a really
00:51:51.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m51s

big memory intensive model and I'm like
00:51:54.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m54s

running out of GPU crazy having the the
00:51:56.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h51m56s

less layers you unfreeze the less memory
00:52:01.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m01s

it takes and the less time it takes so
00:52:03.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m03s

there's that kind of practical aspect so
00:52:05.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m05s

to me she'll say I asked the question
00:52:07.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m07s

right can I just like unfreezes specific
00:52:09.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m09s

layer no you you can only unfreeze
00:52:13.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m13s

layers from layer n onwards you could
00:52:16.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m16s

probably delve inside the library in
00:52:21.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m21s

phase one phase one layer but I don't
00:52:23.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m23s

know why you would
00:52:24.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m24s

okay so I'm really excited to be showing
00:52:28.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m28s

you guys this stuff because it's like
00:52:30.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m30s

it's something we've been kind of
00:52:31.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m31s

researching all year it's figuring out
00:52:32.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m32s

how to train state of the art models and
00:52:34.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m34s

we've kind of found these like tiny
00:52:37.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m37s

number of tricks and so once we do that
00:52:39.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m39s

we now go learn about fit right and you
00:52:41.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m41s

can see look at this we get right up to
00:52:45.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m45s

that 99.5% accuracy which is crazy
00:52:46.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m46s

there's one other trick you might see
00:52:51.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m51s

here that as well as using stochastic
00:52:54.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m54s

gradient descent with restarts a cycle
00:52:55.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m55s

length equals one we've done three
00:52:58.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h52m58s

cycles so earlier on I lied to you I
00:53:00.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m00s

said this is this is the number of
00:53:04.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m04s

epochs it's actually the number of
00:53:05.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m05s

cyclists right so if you said cycle
00:53:07.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m07s

length equals two it would do three
00:53:09.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m09s

cycles of each of two epochs or do six
00:53:11.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m11s

because so here I've said two three
00:53:14.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m14s

cycles yet somehow it's done seven
00:53:17.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m17s

epochs and the reason why is I've got
00:53:19.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m19s

one last trick to show you which is
00:53:22.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m22s

cycle mult equals two and to tell you
00:53:23.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m23s

what that does I'm simply going to draw
00:53:26.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m26s

you a picture you the picture if I go
00:53:27.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m27s

learn Dutch share top plot learning rate
00:53:30.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m30s

there it is
00:53:32.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m32s

now you can see what cycle mode equals
00:53:34.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m34s

to is doing okay it's it's doubling the
00:53:36.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m36s

length of the cycle after each cycle and
00:53:40.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m40s

so in the paper that introduced this
00:53:42.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m42s

stochastic gradient descent with
00:53:44.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m44s

restarts
00:53:46.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m46s

the researcher kind of said hey this is
00:53:46.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m46s

something that seems to sometimes work
00:53:49.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m49s

pretty well and I've certainly found
00:53:51.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m51s

that often to be the case so basically
00:53:53.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m53s

intuitively speaking if your cycle
00:53:57.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h53m57s

length is too short right then it's kind
00:54:00.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m00s

of starts going down to find a good spot
00:54:04.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m04s

and then it pops out and it goes to a
00:54:06.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m06s

try and photographs button pops out it
00:54:08.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m08s

never actually gets to find a good spot
00:54:09.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m09s

right so earlier on you want it to do
00:54:11.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m11s

that because it's trying to find the bit
00:54:14.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m14s

that's like smoother but then later on
00:54:16.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m16s

you want it to fight do more exploring
00:54:18.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m18s

and then more exploring right so that's
00:54:20.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m20s

why this cycle mole equals two thing
00:54:22.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m22s

often seems to be a pretty good approach
00:54:26.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m26s

right so suddenly we're introducing more
00:54:28.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m28s

and more hyper parameters having told
00:54:32.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m32s

you that there aren't that many but
00:54:34.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m34s

the reason is that like you can really
00:54:36.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m36s

get away with just taking a good
00:54:38.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m38s

learning rate but then adding these
00:54:40.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m40s

extra tweaks really helps get that extra
00:54:42.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m42s

level up without any effort right and so
00:54:47.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m47s

in practice I find this kind of three
00:54:50.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m50s

cycles starting at 1 mode equals 2 works
00:54:55.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m55s

very very often to get a pretty decent
00:54:59.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h54m59s

model if it does doesn't then often I'll
00:55:02.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m02s

just do 3 cycles of length 2 with no
00:55:07.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m07s

molt
00:55:10.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m10s

okay there's kind of like two things
00:55:11.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m11s

that seem to work a lot and there's not
00:55:12.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m12s

too much fiddling I find necessary and
00:55:14.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m14s

as I say even even if you just if you
00:55:17.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m17s

use this line every time I'd be
00:55:19.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m19s

surprised if you didn't get a reasonable
00:55:21.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m21s

result so a question here why does a
00:55:23.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m23s

smoother services correlate to more
00:55:29.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m29s

generalize networks so it's kind of this
00:55:32.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m32s

some this intuitive explanation I try to
00:55:40.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m40s

just kill the whole thing I try to give
00:55:44.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m44s

back here which is that if you've got
00:55:46.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m46s

something spiky right and so what this
00:55:51.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m51s

what this x-axis is showing is like how
00:55:58.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h55m58s

how good is this at recognizing dogs
00:56:02.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m02s

versus cats as you change this
00:56:05.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m05s

particular parameter right and so so
00:56:06.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m06s

something to be generalizable that means
00:56:10.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m10s

that we wanted to work when we give it
00:56:12.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m12s

when we give it a slightly different
00:56:14.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m14s

data set and so a slightly different
00:56:15.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m15s

data set may have a slightly different
00:56:17.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m17s

relationship between this parameter and
00:56:20.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m20s

how caddy versus dog it is it may
00:56:22.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m22s

instead look a little bit like this
00:56:25.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m25s

right so in other words if we end up at
00:56:30.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m30s

this point right then it's not going to
00:56:33.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m33s

do a good job on this slightly different
00:56:37.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m37s

data set for else if we end up on this
00:56:38.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m38s

point it's still going to do a good job
00:56:40.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m40s

on this data set
00:56:42.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m42s

okay so that's what psychomotor equals
00:56:49.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m49s

doing okay so we've got one last thing
00:56:52.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m52s

before we going to take a break which is
00:56:54.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m54s

we're now going to take this model which
00:56:55.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m55s

has 99.5 percent accuracy and we're
00:56:58.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h56m58s

going to try and make it better still
00:57:01.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m01s

and what we're going to do is we're not
00:57:02.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m02s

actually going to change the model at
00:57:05.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m05s

all right but instead we're going to
00:57:06.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m06s

look back at the original virtual
00:57:08.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m08s

visualization we did where we looked at
00:57:13.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m13s

some of our incorrect pictures now what
00:57:15.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m15s

I've done is I've printed out the whole
00:57:22.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m22s

of these incorrect pictures but the key
00:57:24.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m24s

thing to realize is that particularly in
00:57:26.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m26s

fact when we do the the validation set
00:57:30.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m30s

all of our inputs to our model all the
00:57:34.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m34s

time have to be square right and the
00:57:37.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m37s

reason for that is it's kind of a minor
00:57:40.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m40s

technical detail but basically the GPU
00:57:43.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m43s

doesn't go very quickly if you have like
00:57:45.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m45s

different dimensions for different
00:57:48.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m48s

images because it needs seems to be
00:57:50.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m50s

consistent so that every part of the GPU
00:57:51.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m51s

can do the same thing and I think this
00:57:53.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m53s

is probably fixable but it now that's
00:57:55.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m55s

the state of the technology we have so
00:57:57.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m57s

our validation set when we actually say
00:57:59.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h57m59s

for this particular thing is it's a dog
00:58:01.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m01s

what we actually do to make it square as
00:58:03.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m03s

we just pick out the square in the
00:58:05.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m05s

middle right so we would take off its
00:58:08.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m08s

two edges and so we take the whole
00:58:10.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m10s

height and then as much of the middle as
00:58:12.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m12s

we can and so you can see in this case
00:58:15.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m15s

we wouldn't actually see this dog's head
00:58:16.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m16s

right so I think the reason this was
00:58:19.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m19s

actually not correctly classified was
00:58:21.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m21s

because the validation set only got to
00:58:24.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m24s

see the body and the body doesn't look
00:58:26.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m26s

particularly doglike or cat-like it's
00:58:29.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m29s

not at all punctual what it is so what
00:58:31.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m31s

we're going to do when we calculate the
00:58:35.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m35s

predictions for our validation set is
00:58:38.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m38s

we're going to use something called test
00:58:39.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m39s

time augmentation and what this means is
00:58:40.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m40s

that every time we decide is this cat or
00:58:43.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m43s

a dog not in the training but after
00:58:46.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m46s

we've trained the model is we're going
00:58:48.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m48s

to actually take four random data
00:58:50.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m50s

augmentations and remember the data
00:58:56.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m56s

augmentations move around
00:58:58.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h58m58s

and zoom in and out and flip okay
00:59:00.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m00s

so we're going to take four of them at
00:59:03.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m03s

random and we're going to take the
00:59:04.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m04s

original and augmented sent a cropped
00:59:06.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m06s

image and we're going to do a prediction
00:59:09.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m09s

for all of those and then we're going to
00:59:11.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m11s

take the average of those predictions so
00:59:13.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m13s

I'm going to say is this a cat is this a
00:59:16.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m16s

cat is this a cat is this a cat but and
00:59:18.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m18s

so hopefully in one of those random ones
00:59:21.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m21s

we actually make sure that the face is
00:59:24.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m24s

there zoomed in by a similar amount to
00:59:26.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m26s

other dogs faces at sea and it's rotated
00:59:28.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m28s

by the amount that it expects to see it
00:59:30.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m30s

and so forth and so do that all we have
00:59:31.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m31s

to do is just call tt8
00:59:36.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m36s

TTA stands for Test time augmentation
00:59:38.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m38s

this term of like what a what do we call
00:59:41.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m41s

up when we're making predictions from up
00:59:43.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m43s

from a model we've trained sometimes
00:59:45.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m45s

it's called inference time sometimes
00:59:47.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m47s

it's called test time everybody since
00:59:48.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m48s

have a different name so TTA and so when
00:59:50.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m50s

we do that we go learn TTA check the
00:59:53.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m53s

accuracy and lo and behold
00:59:55.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m55s

we're now at ninety nine point six five
00:59:57.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m57s

percent which is kind of crazy where's
00:59:59.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=00h59m59s

our green box but for every park we are
01:00:01.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m01s

only showing one type of augmentation or
01:00:07.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m07s

for particular image right so when we
01:00:11.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m11s

are training back here we're not doing
01:00:13.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m13s

any TTA right so TTA is not like you
01:00:16.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m16s

could and sometimes like I've written
01:00:20.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m20s

libraries where after a cheap up I run
01:00:22.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m22s

TTA to see how well it's going but
01:00:24.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m24s

that's not what's happening here I
01:00:26.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m26s

trained the whole thing with training
01:00:27.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m27s

time organization which doesn't have a
01:00:31.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m31s

special name because that's what we mean
01:00:33.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m33s

when we say data augmentation we need
01:00:34.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m34s

training time augmentation so here every
01:00:36.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m36s

time we showed a picture
01:00:38.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m38s

we were randomly changing it a little
01:00:39.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m39s

bit so each epoch each of these seven
01:00:41.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m41s

epochs it was seen slightly different
01:00:43.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m43s

versions of the picture having done that
01:00:45.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m45s

we now have a fully trained model we
01:00:47.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m47s

then said okay let's look at the
01:00:50.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m50s

validation set so TTA by default uses
01:00:52.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m52s

the validation set and said okay what
01:00:54.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m54s

are your predictions of which ones are
01:00:56.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m56s

cats and which ones are dogs and it did
01:00:57.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m57s

4 predictions with different random
01:00:59.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h00m59s

orientations plus one on the organ under
01:01:02.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m02s

Augmented version average them all
01:01:04.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m04s

together and that's what we got and
01:01:06.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m06s

that's what we can't clear the accurate
01:01:07.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m07s

so is there a high probability of having
01:01:10.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m10s

sample in TTA that was not shown in
01:01:12.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m12s

doing trained yeah actually every data
01:01:15.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m15s

augmented for image is is unique because
01:01:19.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m19s

the rotation could be like point zero
01:01:22.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m22s

three four degrees and zoom could be 1.0
01:01:24.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m24s

one sixty five so every time it's
01:01:28.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m28s

slightly different no problem
01:01:30.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m30s

was behind you what's your might not use
01:01:32.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m32s

white padding or something like that
01:01:39.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m39s

just one of your white padding like just
01:01:40.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m40s

you know put like a white water around
01:01:44.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m44s

oh padding's not yes so like there's
01:01:46.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m46s

lots of different types of a better
01:01:48.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m48s

orientation you can do and so one of the
01:01:50.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m50s

things you can do is to add a border
01:01:52.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m52s

around it basically adding a border
01:01:54.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m54s

around it in my experiments doesn't
01:01:57.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m57s

doesn't help it doesn't make it any less
01:01:58.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h01m58s

cat-like it's not the convolutional
01:02:00.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m00s

neural network doesn't seem to find it
01:02:03.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m03s

very interesting basically something
01:02:04.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m04s

that I do do we'll see later is I do
01:02:07.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m07s

something called reflection padding
01:02:08.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m08s

which is where I add some borders that
01:02:10.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m10s

are the outside just reflected it's a
01:02:12.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m12s

way to kind of make some bigger images
01:02:15.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m15s

works well with satellite imagery in
01:02:16.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m16s

particular but yeah in general I don't
01:02:18.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m18s

do I have a lot of padding instead I do
01:02:21.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m21s

a bit of zooming
01:02:23.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m23s

it's kind of follow-up to that last one
01:02:28.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m28s

but rather than cropping just at white
01:02:30.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m30s

space because when you crop you lose the
01:02:33.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m33s

dog's face but if you added white space
01:02:35.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m35s

you wouldn't yeah so that's that's where
01:02:37.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m37s

the kind of the reflection padding or
01:02:40.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m40s

the zooming or whatever can help so
01:02:43.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m43s

there are ways in the faster you know
01:02:44.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m44s

library when you do custom transforms of
01:02:46.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m46s

of making that happen I find that it
01:02:48.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m48s

kind of depends on the image size you
01:02:58.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h02m58s

know but generally speaking it seems
01:03:00.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m00s

that using TTA plus data augmentation
01:03:03.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m03s

the best thing to do is to try to use
01:03:06.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m06s

this larger image as possible and so if
01:03:08.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m08s

you kind of crop the thing down and put
01:03:10.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m10s

white borders on top and bottom it's now
01:03:11.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m11s

quite a lot smaller and so to make it as
01:03:13.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m13s

big as it was before you now have to use
01:03:16.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m16s

more GPU and if you're going to use more
01:03:18.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m18s

that multi figure you could have zoomed
01:03:20.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m20s

in and used a bigger image so in my
01:03:21.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m21s

playing around that doesn't seem to be
01:03:24.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m24s

generally as successful there is a
01:03:25.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m25s

little interest on the topic of how do
01:03:36.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m36s

the domain tation in older than images
01:03:38.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m38s

indeed at least not images um yeah um no
01:03:41.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m41s

one seems to know I actually um I asked
01:03:47.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m47s

some of my friends in the natural
01:03:53.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m53s

language processing community about this
01:03:54.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m54s

we'll get to natural language processing
01:03:55.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m55s

in a couple of lessons you know it seems
01:03:57.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m57s

like it'd be really helpful there's been
01:03:59.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h03m59s

a few example I carry very few number
01:04:01.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m01s

examples of people where papers would
01:04:04.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m04s

like try replacing synonyms for instance
01:04:06.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m06s

but on the whole and understanding of
01:04:08.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m08s

like appropriate data augmentation for
01:04:10.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m10s

non image domains is under-researched in
01:04:12.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m12s

under under developed the question was
01:04:16.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m16s

could couldn't we just use a sliding
01:04:24.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m24s

window to generate on the images so in
01:04:26.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m26s

that dog thank you couldn't we generate
01:04:28.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m28s

three parts of it wouldn't that be
01:04:30.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m30s

better
01:04:33.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m33s

yeah PTI you mean just just in general
01:04:34.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m34s

when you're creating your so
01:04:37.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m37s

training time I would say no that
01:04:40.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m40s

wouldn't be better because we're not
01:04:42.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m42s

gonna get as much variation you know we
01:04:43.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m43s

want to have it like like one degree off
01:04:45.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m45s

five you know five degrees off ten
01:04:48.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m48s

pixels up like lots of slightly
01:04:49.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m49s

different versions and so if you just
01:04:51.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m51s

have three standard ways then you're not
01:04:52.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m52s

giving it as many different ways of
01:04:56.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m56s

looking at the data for testing
01:04:58.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h04m58s

augmentation having fixed cropped
01:05:00.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m00s

locations I think probably would be
01:05:03.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m03s

better and I just haven't gotten around
01:05:07.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m07s

to writing that yet I have a version in
01:05:09.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m09s

an old library I think having fixed
01:05:12.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m12s

cropped locations plus random contrast
01:05:13.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m13s

brightness rotation changes might be
01:05:19.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m19s

better
01:05:21.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m21s

the reason I've got around to it yet is
01:05:23.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m23s

because in my testing it didn't seem to
01:05:25.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m25s

help him practice very much and it made
01:05:27.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m27s

the code a lot more complicated so you
01:05:29.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m29s

know it's kind of it's an interesting
01:05:31.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m31s

question
01:05:32.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m32s

I just wanted all of this last AI api's
01:05:34.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m34s

that you are using is it yeah that's a
01:05:39.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m39s

great question
01:05:44.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m44s

so the faster you go libraries open
01:05:45.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m45s

source and let's talk about it a bit
01:05:47.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m47s

more generally because you know it's
01:05:48.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m48s

like the fact that the fact that we're
01:05:52.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m52s

using this library is kind of
01:05:55.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m55s

interesting and unusual and it sits on
01:05:56.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m56s

top of something called a torch right so
01:05:59.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h05m59s

pi torch is a fairly recent development
01:06:02.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m02s

and it's kind of I've noticed all the
01:06:08.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m08s

researchers that I respect pretty much
01:06:11.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m11s

are now using high torch I found in part
01:06:13.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m13s

two of last year's course that a lot of
01:06:16.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m16s

the cutting-edge stuff I wanted to teach
01:06:18.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m18s

I couldn't do it in chaos and tensorflow
01:06:20.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m20s

which is what we used to teach with and
01:06:23.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m23s

so I had to switch the course to pay
01:06:26.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m26s

torch halfway through part two the
01:06:29.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m29s

problem was that PI torch isn't very
01:06:31.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m31s

easy to use you have to write your own
01:06:35.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m35s

training loop from scratch I basically
01:06:37.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m37s

write everything from scratch or the
01:06:38.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m38s

stuff you see inside the class they are
01:06:40.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m40s

library we would have had to written it
01:06:41.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m41s

you know to learn and so it really makes
01:06:43.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m43s

it very hard to learn deep learning when
01:06:47.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m47s

you have to write hundreds of lines of
01:06:49.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m49s

code to do anything so so we decided to
01:06:50.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m50s

create a library on top of Pi torch
01:06:55.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m55s

because we you know this our mission is
01:06:57.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h06m57s

to teach world class big morning so we
01:07:00.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m00s

wanted to show you like here's how you
01:07:03.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m03s

can be the best in the world at doing it
01:07:04.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m04s

and we found that a lot of the world
01:07:06.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m06s

class stuff we needed to show really
01:07:09.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m09s

needed PI torch or at least with PI
01:07:12.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m12s

torch it was far easier and but then PI
01:07:13.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m13s

thought itself just wasn't suitable as a
01:07:16.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m16s

first thing to teach with for new for
01:07:19.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m19s

new deep learning practitioners so we
01:07:23.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m23s

built this library on up of PI torch
01:07:25.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m25s

initially heavily influenced by chaos
01:07:28.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m28s

which is what we taught last year and
01:07:31.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m31s

but then we realized we could actually
01:07:32.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m32s

make things much much much easier than
01:07:34.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m34s

care us so in care us if you look back
01:07:36.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m36s

at last year's course notes you'll find
01:07:38.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m38s

that all of the code is two to three
01:07:41.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m41s

times longer and there's lots more
01:07:43.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m43s

opportunities for
01:07:45.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m45s

stakes because there's just a lot of
01:07:47.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m47s

things you have to get right so we ended
01:07:48.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m48s

up kind of building this this this
01:07:52.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m52s

library in order to make it easier to
01:07:54.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m54s

get into deep learning but also easier
01:07:57.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h07m57s

to get state-of-the-art results and then
01:08:00.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m00s

over the last year as we started
01:08:03.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m03s

developing on top of that we started
01:08:04.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m04s

discovering that by using this library
01:08:06.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m06s

it made us so much more productive that
01:08:09.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m09s

we actually started kind of developing
01:08:12.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m12s

you state-of-the-art results and new
01:08:14.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m14s

methods ourselves and we started
01:08:15.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m15s

realizing that there's a whole bunch of
01:08:17.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m17s

like papers that have kind of been
01:08:19.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m19s

ignored or lost which when you use them
01:08:21.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m21s

it could like automate or semi-automated
01:08:23.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m23s

stuff like learning read finder that's
01:08:26.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m26s

not in any other library so so it kind
01:08:28.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m28s

of got to the point where now not only
01:08:31.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m31s

is kind of fast AI lets us do things
01:08:33.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m33s

easier much easier than any other
01:08:36.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m36s

approach but at the same time it
01:08:38.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m38s

actually has a lot more kind of
01:08:41.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m41s

sophisticated stuff behind the scenes
01:08:44.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m44s

than anything else so so it's kind of an
01:08:46.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m46s

interesting mix so yeah so we've
01:08:48.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m48s

released this library like at this stage
01:08:52.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m52s

it's like very early version and so
01:08:54.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m54s

through this course by the end of this
01:08:57.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m57s

course I hope as a group you know we
01:08:58.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h08m58s

will all a lot of people are already
01:09:00.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m00s

helping have developed it into something
01:09:02.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m02s

that's you know really pretty stable and
01:09:04.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m04s

rock-solid and yeah anybody can then can
01:09:08.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m08s

use it to build your own models under an
01:09:12.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m12s

open-source license as you can see it's
01:09:16.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m16s

available on github behind the scenes
01:09:18.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m18s

it's it's creating play torch models and
01:09:23.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m23s

so apply torch models can then be
01:09:26.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m26s

exported into various different formats
01:09:29.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m29s

having said that like a lot of folks
01:09:33.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m33s

like issue if you want to do something
01:09:35.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m35s

on a mobile phone for example you're
01:09:36.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m36s

probably going to need to use tensorflow
01:09:38.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m38s

and so later on in this course we're
01:09:40.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m40s

going to show like how some of the
01:09:44.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m44s

things that we're doing in the past AI
01:09:46.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m46s

library you can do in chaos and cancel
01:09:47.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m47s

flow so you can going to get a sense of
01:09:50.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m50s

what the different libraries look like
01:09:51.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m51s

and generally speaking the simple stuff
01:09:53.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m53s

is like it'll take you a small number of
01:09:56.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m56s

days
01:09:59.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h09m59s

to learn to do it and care us in
01:10:00.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m00s

tensorflow versus fast AI and high torch
01:10:02.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m02s

and the more complex stuff often this
01:10:04.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m04s

won't be possible so that like if you
01:10:08.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m08s

needed to be intensive flow you're just
01:10:09.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m09s

kind of simplify it off in a little bit
01:10:12.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m12s

but you know I think the more important
01:10:17.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m17s

thing to realize is every year the kind
01:10:19.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m19s

of the libraries that are available and
01:10:24.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m24s

which ones are the best totally changes
01:10:26.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m26s

so like the main thing I hope that you
01:10:28.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m28s

get out of this course is an
01:10:30.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m30s

understanding of the concepts like
01:10:31.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m31s

here's how you find a learning rate
01:10:33.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m33s

here's why differential learning rates
01:10:34.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m34s

are important is they do learn where the
01:10:36.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m36s

kneeling you know here's what stochastic
01:10:38.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m38s

gradient a second's restarts does so on
01:10:40.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m40s

and so forth because you know by the
01:10:42.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m42s

time we do this course again next year
01:10:45.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m45s

you know the library situations and the
01:10:47.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m47s

difference the king that's a question of
01:10:52.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m52s

that I was wondering if you've had an
01:10:55.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h10m55s

opinion on pyro which is ubers new
01:11:05.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m05s

release I haven't looked at it no I'm
01:11:08.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m08s

very interested in probabilistic
01:11:10.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m10s

programming and it's really cool that's
01:11:11.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m11s

built on top of paper so one of the
01:11:14.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m14s

things we'll learn about in this course
01:11:15.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m15s

is we'll see that PI torch is much more
01:11:17.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m17s

than just a deep learning library it
01:11:19.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m19s

actually lets us write arbitrary
01:11:20.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m20s

gpu-accelerated algorithms from scratch
01:11:24.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m24s

which we're actually going to do and
01:11:28.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m28s

pyro is a great example of what people
01:11:29.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m29s

are now doing with might watch outside
01:11:31.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m31s

of the deep level great ok let's take a
01:11:33.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m33s

eight-minute break and we'll come back
01:11:38.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m38s

at 7:55 so ninety nine point six five
01:11:40.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m40s

percent accuracy what does that mean so
01:11:52.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m52s

in classification when we do
01:11:56.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m56s

classification and machine learning the
01:11:59.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h11m59s

really simple way to look at the result
01:12:01.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m01s

of a classification is what's called the
01:12:04.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m04s

confusion matrix this is not just deep
01:12:05.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m05s

learning but in any kind of classifier
01:12:07.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m07s

machine learning where we say okay what
01:12:09.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m09s

was the actual truth there were
01:12:12.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m12s

thousand cats and a thousand dogs out of
01:12:14.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m14s

the thousand actual cats how many did we
01:12:17.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m17s

predict were cats this is obviously in
01:12:20.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m20s

the validation step this is the images
01:12:22.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m22s

that we didn't use to train with it
01:12:25.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m25s

turns out there were nine hundred
01:12:27.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m27s

ninety-eight cats that we actually
01:12:28.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m28s

predicted as cats and two that we got
01:12:29.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m29s

wrong
01:12:32.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m32s

okay and then for dogs there were nine
01:12:32.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m32s

hundred ninety-five that we predicted
01:12:35.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m35s

were dogs and then five that we got
01:12:36.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m36s

wrong and so often these confusion
01:12:38.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m38s

matrices can be helpful particularly if
01:12:41.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m41s

you've got like four or five classes
01:12:42.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m42s

you're trying to predict to see like
01:12:44.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m44s

which group you having the most trouble
01:12:46.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m46s

with and you can see it uses color
01:12:48.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m48s

coding to tell you you know to highlight
01:12:49.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m49s

the large the large bits you've got to
01:12:52.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m52s

hope that the diagonal is the
01:12:55.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m55s

highlighted section so now that we've
01:12:57.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h12m57s

retrained the model it can be quite
01:13:01.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m01s

helpful now that's better to actually
01:13:02.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m02s

look back and see like okay which ones
01:13:04.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m04s

in particular were incorrect and we can
01:13:07.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m07s

see here there were actually only two
01:13:09.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m09s

incorrect cats it prints out four by
01:13:12.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m12s

default so you can actually see these
01:13:15.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m15s

two actually less than 0.5 so they
01:13:16.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m16s

weren't they weren't wrong okay so it's
01:13:19.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m19s

actually these two were wrong cats and
01:13:21.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m21s

this one isn't obviously a cat at all
01:13:23.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m23s

this one is but it looks like it's got a
01:13:26.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m26s

lot of weird artifacts and you can't see
01:13:28.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m28s

its eyeballs at all so and then here are
01:13:31.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m31s

the how many dogs where they're all
01:13:34.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m34s

wrong there were five wrong dogs here
01:13:36.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m36s

are four of them that's not obviously a
01:13:38.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m38s

dog that looks like a mistake that looks
01:13:40.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m40s

like a mistake that one I guess doesn't
01:13:44.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m44s

have enough information that I guess
01:13:46.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m46s

it's a mistake so so we've done a pretty
01:13:47.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m47s

good job here of creating a good
01:13:51.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m51s

classifier I would based on entering a
01:13:53.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m53s

lot of capital competitions and
01:13:57.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m57s

comparing results I've done two various
01:13:59.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h13m59s

research papers I can tell you it's a
01:14:00.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m00s

state of the art classifier it's it's
01:14:02.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m02s

right up there with the best in the
01:14:05.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m05s

world we're going to make it a little
01:14:06.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m06s

bit better in a moment but here in the
01:14:08.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m08s

basic steps right so if you want to
01:14:09.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m09s

create a world-class image classifier
01:14:11.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m11s

the steps that we just went through was
01:14:14.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m14s

that we started our week's term data
01:14:16.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m16s

augmentation on by saying oil transforms
01:14:18.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m18s

equals and you either say sidon or
01:14:21.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m21s

top-down depending on what you're doing
01:14:22.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m22s

start with pre compute equals true find
01:14:24.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m24s

a decent learning
01:14:27.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m27s

eight we then train just like it one or
01:14:28.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m28s

two epochs which that takes a few
01:14:31.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m31s

seconds as we got through compute equals
01:14:33.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m33s

true then we turn off pre compute which
01:14:34.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m34s

allows us to use data augmentation to do
01:14:37.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m37s

another two or three epochs generally
01:14:40.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m40s

with cycle length equals one then I
01:14:43.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m43s

unfreeze all them as I then set the
01:14:45.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m45s

earlier layers to be like either
01:14:48.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m48s

somewhere between a 3 times 2 10 times
01:14:50.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m50s

mobile learning rate in the previous so
01:14:52.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m52s

in this case I did 10 times right so
01:14:54.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h14m54s

it's like this was my learning rate that
01:15:01.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m01s

I found from the learning rate finer
01:15:03.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m03s

than I went 10 times smaller and then 10
01:15:04.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m04s

times smaller as a rule of thumb like
01:15:06.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m06s

knowing that you're starting with a pre
01:15:08.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m08s

trained imagenet model if you know if
01:15:11.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m11s

you can see that the things that you're
01:15:13.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m13s

now trying to classify a pretty similar
01:15:15.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m15s

the kinds of things in imagenet ie
01:15:17.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m17s

pictures of normal objects in normal
01:15:18.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m18s

environments
01:15:21.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m21s

you probably want about a 10x difference
01:15:21.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m21s

because you want those earlier layers
01:15:24.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m24s

like you think that the earlier layers
01:15:26.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m26s

are probably very good already but also
01:15:27.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m27s

if you're doing something like satellite
01:15:30.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m30s

imagery or medical imaging which is not
01:15:31.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m31s

at all like image net then you probably
01:15:34.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m34s

want to be training those earlier layers
01:15:36.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m36s

a lot more so you might have like oh
01:15:37.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m37s

just a 3/8 difference all right so
01:15:39.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m39s

that's like one change that I make is to
01:15:42.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m42s

try to make it out of 10x or 3x yes so
01:15:45.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m45s

then after unfreezing you can now call
01:15:52.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m52s

LR find again but at Nike didn't in this
01:15:56.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m56s

case but like once you've unfrozen all
01:15:59.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h15m59s

the layers you've turned on differential
01:16:01.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m01s

learning rates you can then call a lot
01:16:03.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m03s

of fine again right and so you can then
01:16:05.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m05s

check like oh does it still look like
01:16:10.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m10s

the same point I had last time is about
01:16:12.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m12s

right something to note is that if you
01:16:13.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m13s

call LR find having set differential
01:16:16.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m16s

learning rates the thing that's actually
01:16:20.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m20s

going to print out is the learning rate
01:16:21.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m21s

of the last layers right because you've
01:16:23.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m23s

got three different learning rates so
01:16:25.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m25s

it's actually showing you the last layer
01:16:27.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m27s

so then yeah then I trained the full
01:16:28.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m28s

network with cycle more equals two and
01:16:31.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m31s

it'll either it starts with the fitting
01:16:33.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m33s

or I run out of time right so like let
01:16:35.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m35s

me show you all right so let's do this
01:16:38.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m38s

again
01:16:40.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m40s

a totally different data set so this
01:16:41.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m41s

morning I noticed that some of you on
01:16:43.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m43s

the forums were playing around with this
01:16:45.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m45s

playground Kegel competition very
01:16:47.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m47s

similar called dog breed identification
01:16:49.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m49s

so the dog breed identification cat will
01:16:53.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m53s

challenge is one where you don't
01:16:56.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m56s

actually have to decide which ones are
01:16:59.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h16m59s

cats and which ones the dogs they're all
01:17:01.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m01s

dogs but you have to decide what kind of
01:17:02.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m02s

dog it is but there are 120 different
01:17:05.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m05s

breeds of dogs okay
01:17:07.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m07s

so you know obviously this could be like
01:17:10.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m10s

different types of cells and pathology
01:17:14.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m14s

slides it could be different kinds of
01:17:18.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m18s

cancers in CT scans it could be
01:17:20.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m20s

different kinds of icebergs and
01:17:23.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m23s

satellite images whatever right as long
01:17:25.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m25s

as you've got some kind of labeled
01:17:28.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m28s

images so I want to show you what I did
01:17:29.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m29s

this morning so it took me about an hour
01:17:33.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m33s

basically to go in to end from something
01:17:34.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m34s

I'd never seen before so I downloaded
01:17:38.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m38s

the data from kaggle and I'll show you
01:17:42.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m42s

how to do that shortly but the short
01:17:43.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m43s

answer is there's something called cable
01:17:45.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m45s

CLI which is a github project you can
01:17:47.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m47s

search for and if you read the docs to
01:17:49.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m49s

basically run cagey download provide the
01:17:51.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m51s

competition name and it will grab all
01:17:54.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m54s

the data for you to your crystal or
01:17:55.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m55s

Amazon or whatever instance I put in my
01:17:57.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h17m57s

data folder and I then went LS and I saw
01:18:01.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m01s

that it's a little bit different to our
01:18:07.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m07s

previous data set it's not that there's
01:18:12.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m12s

a train folder which has a separate
01:18:14.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m14s

folder for each kind of dog but instead
01:18:17.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m17s

of tonette there was a CSV file and the
01:18:20.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m20s

CSV file I read it in with pandas so
01:18:22.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m22s

pandas is the thing we use in python to
01:18:25.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m25s

do structured data analysis like csv
01:18:27.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m27s

files so he picked pandas we called pd
01:18:30.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m30s

that's pretty much universal PDR htsb
01:18:33.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m33s

reads in the csv file we can then take a
01:18:36.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m36s

look at it and you can see that
01:18:38.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m38s

basically it had like some kind of
01:18:39.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m39s

identifier and then the debris right so
01:18:41.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m41s

this is like a different way this is the
01:18:45.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m45s

second main way that people kind of give
01:18:46.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m46s

you image labels one is to put different
01:18:49.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m49s

images into different folders
01:18:51.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m51s

the second is generally to give you as
01:18:53.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m53s

some kind of file like a CSV file to
01:18:55.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m55s

tell you here's the image name and
01:18:57.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m57s

here's the label okay so what I then did
01:18:59.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h18m59s

was I used pandas again to create a
01:19:05.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m05s

pivot table which basically groups it up
01:19:08.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m08s

just to see how many of each breed there
01:19:10.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m10s

were and I sorted them and so I saw okay
01:19:13.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m13s

they've got like about a hundred some of
01:19:15.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m15s

the more common breeds and some of the
01:19:18.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m18s

less common breeds they've got like 60
01:19:21.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m21s

or so okay altogether there are 120 rows
01:19:23.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m23s

and I've been 120 different breeds
01:19:27.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m27s

represented okay so I'm going to go
01:19:28.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m28s

through the steps right so enable data
01:19:32.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m32s

augmentation so to enable data
01:19:35.879
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m35s

augmentation when we call this
01:19:37.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m37s

transforms from model you just pass in
01:19:39.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m39s

and all transformers in this case I
01:19:42.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m42s

chose side on again these are pictures
01:19:44.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m44s

of dots and stuff so this side on photos
01:19:46.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m46s

I we're talking about maqsuum as more
01:19:48.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m48s

detail later but maximum basically says
01:19:53.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m53s

when you do the data augmentation we
01:19:55.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m55s

like zoom into it by up to one point one
01:19:58.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h19m58s

times okay so but randomly between one
01:20:01.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m01s

the original image size and one point
01:20:04.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m04s

one points so it's not always cropping
01:20:06.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m06s

out in the middle or an edge but it
01:20:08.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m08s

could be cropping out a smaller part
01:20:11.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m11s

okay so having done that the key step
01:20:12.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m12s

now is to graphically going from paths
01:20:16.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m16s

so previously we went from paths and
01:20:18.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m18s

that tells it that the the names of the
01:20:21.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m21s

folders are the names of the labels we
01:20:23.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m23s

go from CSV and we pass in the CSV file
01:20:25.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m25s

that contains the letters so we're
01:20:29.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m29s

passing in the path that contains all of
01:20:32.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m32s

the data the name of the folder that
01:20:34.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m34s

contains the training data the CSV that
01:20:37.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m37s

contains the labels we need to also tell
01:20:40.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m40s

it where the test set is if you want to
01:20:43.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m43s

submit to cattle later talk more about
01:20:45.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m45s

that next week now this time the
01:20:47.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m47s

previous data set we had had actually
01:20:53.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m53s

separated a validation set out into a
01:20:55.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m55s

separate folder right but in this case
01:20:57.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m57s

you'll see that there is not a separate
01:20:59.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h20m59s

folder called validation right so we
01:21:02.459
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m02s

want to be able to track how good our
01:21:05.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m05s

performance is low
01:21:07.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m07s

so we're going to have to separate some
01:21:09.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m09s

of the images out to put it into a
01:21:10.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m10s

validation set okay so I do that at
01:21:12.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m12s

random and so up here you can see how it
01:21:15.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m15s

basically opened up the CSV file turned
01:21:18.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m18s

it into a list of rows and then taken
01:21:22.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m22s

the length of that minus one because
01:21:25.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m25s

there's a header at the top right and so
01:21:28.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m28s

that's the number of rows in the CSV
01:21:30.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m30s

file which must be the number of images
01:21:33.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m33s

that we have and then this is a fast AI
01:21:35.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m35s

thing get cross-validation indexes now
01:21:37.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m37s

we'll talk about cross-validation later
01:21:40.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m40s

but basically if you call this and pass
01:21:42.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m42s

in a number it's going to return to you
01:21:44.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m44s

by default a random twenty percent of
01:21:48.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m48s

the rows who uses your validation set
01:21:52.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m52s

and you can pass in parameters to get
01:21:54.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m54s

different amounts right so this is now
01:21:57.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m57s

going to grab twenty percent of the data
01:21:58.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h21m58s

and say all right this is the this is
01:22:00.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m00s

the indexes the numbers of the files
01:22:03.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m03s

which we're going to use as a validation
01:22:05.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m05s

set
01:22:07.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m07s

okay so now that we've got that in fact
01:22:08.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m08s

let's kind of run this so you can see
01:22:12.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m12s

what that looks like so well indexes is
01:22:14.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m14s

just a big bunch of numbers okay and so
01:22:19.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m19s

an is
01:22:23.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m23s

10,000 right and so we have about twenty
01:22:26.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m26s

percent of those is going to be in a
01:22:31.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m31s

validation set
01:22:33.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m33s

so when we call from CSV we can pass in
01:22:34.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m34s

a parameter which is talent which
01:22:44.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m44s

indexes to treat us a validation set and
01:22:46.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m46s

so that's passed in those indexes one
01:22:48.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m48s

thing that's a little bit tricky here is
01:22:52.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m52s

that the file names actually have I
01:22:54.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h22m54s

checked they actually have a dot jpg on
01:23:03.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m03s

the end and these obviously don't have a
01:23:05.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m05s

dot jpg so you can pass in when you call
01:23:07.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m07s

from CSV you can pass in a suffix it
01:23:11.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m11s

says that the labels don't actually
01:23:13.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m13s

contain the full file names you need to
01:23:15.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m15s

add this to them okay so that's
01:23:17.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m17s

basically all I need to do to set up my
01:23:22.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m22s

data and as a lot of Europe noticed
01:23:24.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m24s

during the week inside that data object
01:23:28.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m28s

you can actually get access to the data
01:23:31.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m31s

set like what the training data set by
01:23:33.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m33s

same train yes and inside train des is a
01:23:35.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m35s

whole bunch of things including the file
01:23:38.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m38s

names
01:23:41.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m41s

okay so train desktop file names
01:23:41.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m41s

contains all of the file names of
01:23:43.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m43s

everything in the training set and so
01:23:45.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m45s

here's like one file name
01:23:47.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m47s

okay so here's an example of one file
01:23:48.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m48s

name so I can now go ahead and open that
01:23:50.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m50s

file and take a look at it that's the
01:23:54.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m54s

next thing I did was to try and
01:23:56.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m56s

understand what my file my dataset looks
01:23:58.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m58s

like and it found an adorable puppy so
01:23:59.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h23m59s

that was very nice
01:24:02.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m02s

so feeling good about this I also want
01:24:03.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m03s

to know like how big of these files
01:24:06.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m06s

right like how big are the images
01:24:08.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m08s

because that's a key issue if they're
01:24:09.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m09s

huge and then I have to think really
01:24:12.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m12s

carefully about how to deal with huge
01:24:13.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m13s

images that's really challenging if
01:24:15.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m15s

they're tiny well that's also
01:24:17.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m17s

challenging most of imagenet models are
01:24:19.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m19s

trained on either 224 by 224 or 299 by
01:24:22.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m22s

299 images so anytime you have images in
01:24:25.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m25s

that kind of range that's that's really
01:24:28.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m28s

hopeful you're probably not going to
01:24:31.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m31s

have to do too much different in this
01:24:32.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m32s

case the first image I looked at was
01:24:34.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m34s

about the right size so I'm thinking of
01:24:36.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m36s

pretty hopeful so what I did then is I
01:24:38.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m38s

created a dictionary comprehension now
01:24:41.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m41s

if you don't know about list
01:24:42.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m42s

comprehensions and dictionary
01:24:44.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m44s

comprehensions in Python go study them
01:24:45.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m45s

they're the most useful thing super
01:24:48.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m48s

handy you can see the basic idea here is
01:24:51.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m51s

that are going through all of the files
01:24:54.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m54s

and then putting a dictionary that map's
01:24:55.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m55s

the name of the file to the size of that
01:24:57.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h24m57s

file again this is a handy little Python
01:25:01.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m01s

feature which I'll let you think learn
01:25:05.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m05s

about during the week if you don't know
01:25:07.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m07s

about it which is zip and using a
01:25:08.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m08s

special star notation is never to take
01:25:10.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m10s

this dictionary and turn it into the
01:25:12.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m12s

rows and the columns and so I can now
01:25:15.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m15s

turn those into num pay arrays and like
01:25:19.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m19s

okay here are the first five rows sizes
01:25:22.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m22s

for each of my images and then
01:25:26.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m26s

matplotlib is something you want to be
01:25:28.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m28s

very familiar with if you do any kind of
01:25:30.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m30s

data science or machine learning in
01:25:32.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m32s

python matplotlib we always refer to as
01:25:33.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m33s

PLT as if this is a histogram and so I
01:25:36.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m36s

got a histogram of the how high how many
01:25:39.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m39s

rows there are in each image so you can
01:25:43.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m43s

see here I'm kind of getting a sense
01:25:45.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m45s

before I start doing any modeling I kind
01:25:46.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m46s

of need to know what I'm modeling with
01:25:49.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m49s

and I can see some of the images are
01:25:50.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m50s

going to be like 2500 3000 pixels high
01:25:52.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m52s

but most of them seem to be around 500
01:25:54.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m54s

so given it so few of them were bigger
01:25:57.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h25m57s

than a thousand I use standard numpy
01:26:00.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m00s

slicing to just grab those at a smaller
01:26:03.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m03s

than a thousand and histogram that just
01:26:05.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m05s

to zoom in a little bit and I can see
01:26:08.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m08s

here all right it looks like yet the
01:26:10.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m10s

vast majority are around 500 and so this
01:26:12.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m12s

actually also prints out the histogram
01:26:15.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m15s

so I can actually go through and I can
01:26:17.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m17s

see here for four thousand five hundred
01:26:19.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m19s

of them are about 450 okay so I get
01:26:21.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m21s

about that seems about anywhere so
01:26:23.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m23s

generally how many images should we get
01:26:28.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m28s

in the validation set is always a 20%
01:26:32.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m32s

so the size of the validation set like
01:26:38.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m38s

using 20% is fine unless you kind of
01:26:44.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m44s

feeling like my data is my data sets
01:26:48.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m48s

really small I'm not sure that's enough
01:26:49.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m49s

you know like if you've got basically
01:26:53.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m53s

think of it this way if you train like
01:26:57.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m57s

the same model multiple times and you're
01:26:59.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h26m59s

getting very different validation set
01:27:01.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m01s

results and your validation sets kind of
01:27:02.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m02s

small but smaller than a thousand or so
01:27:04.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m04s

then it's going to be quite hard to
01:27:08.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m08s

interpret how well you're doing now this
01:27:10.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m10s

is particularly true like if you're like
01:27:13.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m13s

if you care about the third decimal
01:27:14.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m14s

place of accuracy and you've got like a
01:27:16.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m16s

thousand things in your validation set
01:27:19.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m19s

then you bring about like a single image
01:27:21.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m21s

changing class is changing you know it's
01:27:22.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m22s

what you're looking at so it's it really
01:27:25.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m25s

depends on my cow accurate you have much
01:27:28.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m28s

difference you care about I would say in
01:27:31.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m31s

general like at the point where you care
01:27:35.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m35s

about difference between like out of
01:27:37.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m37s

0.01 and 0.02 like the second decimal
01:27:39.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m39s

place you want that to represent like 10
01:27:41.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m41s

or 20 roads you know like changing the
01:27:44.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m44s

class of that 10 or 20 rows then that's
01:27:48.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m48s

something you can be pretty confident of
01:27:51.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m51s

so like most of the time you know give
01:27:53.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m53s

them the data sizes we normally have 20
01:27:57.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h27m57s

percent seems to work fine but yeah it's
01:28:00.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m00s

it's it's kind of a it depends a lot on
01:28:04.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m04s

specifically what you're doing and what
01:28:07.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m07s

you care about and it's not it's not a
01:28:09.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m09s

deep learning specific question either
01:28:12.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m12s

you know so those who are interested in
01:28:15.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m15s

this kind of thing we're going to look
01:28:17.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m17s

into it a lot more detail in our machine
01:28:17.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m17s

learning course which will also be
01:28:19.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m19s

available online ok so I did the same
01:28:23.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m23s

thing for the columns just to make sure
01:28:28.459
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m28s

that these aren't like super wide and
01:28:29.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m29s

I've got similar results and checked in
01:28:31.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m31s

and again found they're kind of like 4
01:28:33.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m33s

or 500 seem to be about the average size
01:28:35.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m35s

so based on all of that I kind of
01:28:37.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m37s

thought ok this looks like a pretty
01:28:39.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m39s

normal kind of image data set that I can
01:28:41.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m41s

probably use pretty normal kinds of
01:28:43.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m43s

models on I was also particularly
01:28:44.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m44s

encouraged to see that when I looked at
01:28:46.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m46s

the
01:28:48.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m48s

that the dog like takes up most of the
01:28:48.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m48s

frame right so I'm not too worried about
01:28:51.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m51s

like cropping problems you know if the
01:28:53.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m53s

if the dog was just like a tiny little
01:28:56.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m56s

piece of one little corner that I'd be
01:28:57.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h28m57s

thinking about doing different you know
01:29:00.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m00s

maybe zooming in a lot more or something
01:29:02.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m02s

like a medical imaging that happens a
01:29:04.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m04s

lot like often the tumor or the cell
01:29:07.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m07s

whatever is like one tiny piece and
01:29:09.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m09s

there's much more complex so yeah based
01:29:11.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m11s

on all that and this morning I kind of
01:29:14.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m14s

thought like okay this looks pretty
01:29:15.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m15s

standard so I I went ahead and created a
01:29:18.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m18s

little function called get data that
01:29:24.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m24s

basically had my normal two lines of
01:29:26.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m26s

code in it but I made it so I could
01:29:28.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m28s

passed in a size and a batch size the
01:29:31.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m31s

reason for this is that when I start
01:29:35.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m35s

working with new data set I want
01:29:37.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m37s

everything to go super fast and so if I
01:29:38.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m38s

use small images it's going to go super
01:29:41.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m41s

fast so I actually started out with size
01:29:43.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m43s

equals 64 just to create some super
01:29:46.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m46s

small images that just go like a second
01:29:49.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m49s

to run through and see how it later on I
01:29:51.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m51s

started using some big images and some
01:29:54.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m54s

and some also some bigger architectures
01:29:57.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m57s

at which point I started running out of
01:29:59.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h29m59s

GPU memory so I started getting these
01:30:01.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m01s

errors saying CUDA out of memory error
01:30:02.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m02s

when you get a CUDA out of memory error
01:30:05.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m05s

the first thing you need to do is to go
01:30:08.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m08s

kernel restart once you get a code an
01:30:10.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m10s

out of memory error on your GPU you
01:30:13.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m13s

can't really recover from it right
01:30:15.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m15s

doesn't matter what you do you know you
01:30:17.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m17s

have to go restart and once I've
01:30:18.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m18s

restarted I then just changed my batch
01:30:22.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m22s

size to something smaller so when you
01:30:24.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m24s

call create your data object you can
01:30:26.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m26s

pass in a batch size parameter okay and
01:30:30.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m30s

like i normally use 64 until i hit
01:30:34.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m34s

something that says out of memory and
01:30:37.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m37s

then i'll just have it and if i still
01:30:39.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m39s

get out of memory I was hobbit again
01:30:40.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m40s

okay so that's where I created this to
01:30:42.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m42s

allow me to like start making my size as
01:30:45.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m45s

bigger as I looked into it more and you
01:30:47.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m47s

know as I started running out of memory
01:30:50.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m50s

to decrease my batch size so at this
01:30:51.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m51s

point you know I went through this a
01:30:55.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m55s

couple of iterations but I basically
01:30:57.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m57s

found everything was working fine so
01:30:59.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h30m59s

once it's working fine
01:31:01.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m01s

set size 2 to 24 and I created my you
01:31:02.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m02s

know pre-compute equals true first time
01:31:07.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m07s

I did that it took a minute to create
01:31:10.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m10s

the precomputed activations and then it
01:31:11.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m11s

ran through this in about 4 or 5 seconds
01:31:13.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m13s

and you can see I was getting
01:31:15.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m15s

eighty-three percent accuracy
01:31:17.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m17s

now remember accuracy means it's it's
01:31:18.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m18s

exactly right and so it's predicting out
01:31:21.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m21s

of a hundred and twenty categories it's
01:31:24.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m24s

predicting exactly right so when you see
01:31:26.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m26s

something with two classes is you know
01:31:27.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m27s

80% accurate versus something with 120
01:31:30.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m30s

classes is 80% accurate they're very
01:31:33.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m33s

different levels you know so when I saw
01:31:36.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m36s

like eighty-three percent accuracy with
01:31:39.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m39s

just a pre computed classify and OData
01:31:41.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m41s

augmentation though I'm freezing
01:31:43.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m43s

anything else
01:31:45.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m45s

across 120 classes of the oh this looks
01:31:46.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m46s

good right so um then I just kind of
01:31:49.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m49s

kept going throughout at all standard
01:31:54.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m54s

process right so then I turn precompute
01:31:56.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h31m56s

off okay and cycle length equals one and
01:32:01.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m01s

I started doing a few more cycles few
01:32:06.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m06s

more epochs so remember an epoch is one
01:32:10.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m10s

pass through the data and a cycle is
01:32:15.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m15s

however many epochs you said is in a
01:32:19.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m19s

cycle it's one it's the learning rate
01:32:22.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m22s

going from the top that you asked for
01:32:24.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m24s

all the way down so since here cycle
01:32:26.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m26s

length equals one a cycle in an epoch at
01:32:29.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m29s

the same okay so I did I tried a few
01:32:31.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m31s

epochs I did actually do the learning
01:32:35.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m35s

rate finder and I found one in a two
01:32:39.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m39s

again looked fine it often looks fine
01:32:41.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m41s

and I found it kind of kept improving so
01:32:43.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m43s

I tried five epochs and I found my
01:32:46.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m46s

accuracy getting better so then I saved
01:32:48.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m48s

that and I tried something which we
01:32:54.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m54s

haven't looked at before but it's kind
01:32:56.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m56s

of cool if you train something on a
01:32:58.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h32m58s

smaller size you can then actually call
01:33:01.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m01s

learned set data and pass in a larger
01:33:05.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m05s

size data set and that's gonna take your
01:33:10.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m10s

model however it's trained so far and
01:33:12.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m12s

it's going to let you can
01:33:14.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m14s

in you to train on on larger images and
01:33:16.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m16s

I tell you something amazing
01:33:20.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m20s

this actually is another way you can get
01:33:22.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m22s

state-of-the-art results and I've never
01:33:25.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m25s

seen this written in any paper or
01:33:26.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m26s

discussed anywhere as far as I know this
01:33:29.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m29s

is a new insight basically I've got a
01:33:30.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m30s

pre trained model which in this case
01:33:34.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m34s

I've trained a few epochs with the size
01:33:36.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m36s

of 224 by 224 and I'm now going to do a
01:33:38.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m38s

few more air pops with the size of 299
01:33:41.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m41s

by 299 now I've gotten very little data
01:33:43.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m43s

cut out by deep learning standards only
01:33:47.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m47s

about 10,000 images right so with a 224
01:33:49.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m49s

by 224 I kind of built this these final
01:33:52.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m52s

layers to try to find things that work
01:33:55.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m55s

well to 24 but to 24 but I go to 299 by
01:33:57.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h33m57s

299 I basically if I over fit before I'm
01:34:01.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m01s

definitely not going to over fit now
01:34:05.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m05s

might have changed the size of my images
01:34:07.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m07s

they're kind of like totally different
01:34:08.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m08s

but like conceptually they're still
01:34:10.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m10s

picked the same kinds of pictures are
01:34:13.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m13s

the same kinds of things so I found this
01:34:14.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m14s

trick of like starting training on small
01:34:16.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m16s

images for a few a box and then
01:34:19.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m19s

switching to bigger images and
01:34:21.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m21s

continuing training is an amazingly
01:34:22.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m22s

effective way to avoid overfitting and
01:34:25.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m25s

it's like it's so easy and so obvious I
01:34:28.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m28s

don't understand why it's never been
01:34:32.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m32s

written about before maybe it's in some
01:34:34.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m34s

paper somewhere and I haven't found it
01:34:36.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m36s

but it's I haven't seen it would it be
01:34:37.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m37s

possible to do the same thing on using
01:34:44.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m44s

let's take a resort our disposal to feed
01:34:46.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m46s

a different size yeah I think so like as
01:34:49.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m49s

long as you use one of these more modern
01:34:53.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m53s

architectures what we call fully
01:34:56.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m56s

convolutional architectures which means
01:34:57.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h34m57s

not vgg and you'll see we don't use vgg
01:35:00.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m00s

in this course because it doesn't have
01:35:02.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m02s

this property but most of the
01:35:04.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m04s

architectures developed in the last
01:35:06.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m06s

couple of years can handle pretty much
01:35:07.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m07s

arbitrary sizes yeah be worth trying
01:35:09.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m09s

yeah I think it ought to work okay so I
01:35:13.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m13s

call get data again remember get data is
01:35:18.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m18s

the just a little function that I
01:35:20.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m20s

created back up here right get data is
01:35:21.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m21s

just this little function that's oh I
01:35:22.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m22s

just passed a different size to it and
01:35:24.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m24s

so I call freeze just to make sure that
01:35:27.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m27s

but everything so the last layer is
01:35:31.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m31s

frozen I mean it actually already was at
01:35:33.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m33s

its point that really doing a thing
01:35:35.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m35s

and
01:35:37.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m37s

you can see now with free compute off
01:35:42.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m42s

I've now got that data augmentation
01:35:44.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m44s

working so I kind of run a few more a
01:35:46.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m46s

pox and what I notice here is that the
01:35:48.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m48s

loss to my training set and the loss of
01:35:51.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m51s

my validation set my validation set loss
01:35:54.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m54s

is a lot lower than my training set this
01:35:56.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m56s

is still just training the last layer so
01:35:58.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h35m58s

what this is telling me is I'm under
01:36:00.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m00s

fitting right and so from under fitting
01:36:02.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m02s

it means this cycle length equals one is
01:36:05.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m05s

too short it means it's like finding
01:36:07.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m07s

something better popped with popping out
01:36:08.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m08s

and it's like never getting a chance to
01:36:10.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m10s

zoom in properly so then I'd set cycle
01:36:12.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m12s

mod equals two to give it more time so
01:36:15.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m15s

like the first time is one epoch the
01:36:18.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m18s

second one is two epochs
01:36:21.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m21s

the third one is for epochs and you can
01:36:23.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m23s

see now the validation train and
01:36:26.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m26s

training are about the same okay so
01:36:28.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m28s

that's kind of thinking yeah this is
01:36:30.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m30s

this is about the right track and so
01:36:32.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m32s

then I tried using test time
01:36:34.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m34s

augmentation to see if that gets any
01:36:36.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m36s

better still didn't actually help a hell
01:36:38.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m38s

of a lot just a tiny bit and just kind
01:36:40.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m40s

of at this point I think here this is
01:36:44.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m44s

nearly done so I just did it like you
01:36:46.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m46s

know one more cycle of two to see if it
01:36:48.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m48s

got any better and it did get a little
01:36:50.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m50s

bit better and then I'm like okay that
01:36:53.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m53s

looks pretty good
01:36:55.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m55s

I've got a validation set lost 0.199
01:36:57.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h36m57s

and so your Lotus here actually you
01:37:02.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m02s

haven't tried unfreezing the reason why
01:37:05.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m05s

I was going to try to unfreezing and
01:37:08.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m08s

training more it didn't get any better
01:37:09.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m09s

and so the reason for this clearly is
01:37:11.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m11s

that this data set is so similar the
01:37:13.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m13s

image net that the training that
01:37:16.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m16s

convolutional layers actually doesn't
01:37:19.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m19s

help in the slightest and actually when
01:37:20.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m20s

I loaded up into it it turns out that
01:37:23.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m23s

this competition is actually using a
01:37:25.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m25s

subset of improve image net so that's
01:37:27.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m27s

okay so that if we check this out point
01:37:30.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m30s

one nine nine against the leaderboard
01:37:33.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m33s

this is only a playground competition so
01:37:36.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m36s

it's not like the best of here but you
01:37:38.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m38s

know it's still interesting it gets us
01:37:40.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m40s

somewhere around ten thrillers okay and
01:37:44.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m44s

in fact we're competing against I
01:37:48.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m48s

noticed other
01:37:52.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m52s

the first AI student this is a first AI
01:37:53.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m53s

student these people up here I know they
01:37:55.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m55s

actually posted that they cheated they
01:37:58.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h37m58s

actually went you downloaded the
01:38:00.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m00s

original images and train to that so and
01:38:02.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m02s

this is why this is a playground
01:38:07.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m07s

competition they call it it's not it's
01:38:08.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m08s

not real right you know it's just to
01:38:10.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m10s

allow us to try things out but you can
01:38:12.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m12s

basically see out of two hundred and
01:38:14.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m14s

something people where you know we're
01:38:18.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m18s

getting some very good results without
01:38:20.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m20s

doing anything remotely interesting or
01:38:23.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m23s

clever and we haven't even used the
01:38:25.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m25s

whole data set you're going to use to
01:38:26.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m26s

eighty percent of it like to get a
01:38:27.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m27s

better result I would go back and remove
01:38:29.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m29s

that validation set and just rerun the
01:38:31.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m31s

same steps and then submit that exact
01:38:33.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m33s

let's just use it under percent of the
01:38:36.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m36s

data I have three questions the first
01:38:37.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m37s

one is like that class in this case is
01:38:48.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m48s

very it's not balanced
01:38:50.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m50s

instead unbalanced like it's not totally
01:38:53.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m53s

balanced but it's not bad right it's
01:38:56.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m56s

like between sixty and a hundred like
01:38:58.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h38m58s

it's it's it's it's not unbalanced
01:39:02.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m02s

enough that I would give it a second
01:39:04.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m04s

thought
01:39:05.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m05s

okay yeah let's get to that later in
01:39:06.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m06s

this course and don't let me forget
01:39:14.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m14s

right the short answer is that there was
01:39:16.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m16s

a recent list the paper came out about
01:39:18.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m18s

two or three weeks ago on this and it
01:39:20.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m20s

said the best way to deal with very
01:39:21.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m21s

unbalanced data sets is to basically
01:39:23.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m23s

make copies of the rare cases yeah my
01:39:25.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m25s

second question is I want to pin down a
01:39:35.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m35s

difference between creation he read was
01:39:38.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m38s

and so you have these two options right
01:39:40.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m40s

so when you beginning I did an
01:39:44.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m44s

optimization use that pre computed it
01:39:47.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m47s

was true by not using layers right right
01:39:49.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m49s

so it's not only they frozen their pre
01:39:52.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m52s

computed so the data augmentation
01:39:54.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m54s

doesn't do anything at that point
01:39:55.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m55s

right before you outcries everything
01:39:59.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h39m59s

what as examples you and IV only you
01:40:03.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m03s

only on freeze
01:40:06.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m06s

so we're going to learn more about the
01:40:08.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m08s

details as we look into the the math and
01:40:10.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m10s

stuff in coming lessons but basically
01:40:12.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m12s

what happened was we started with a pre
01:40:14.459
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m14s

trained network right which was kind of
01:40:16.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m16s

finding activations that had these kind
01:40:20.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m20s

of rich features and we were adding then
01:40:23.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m23s

we add a couple of layers on the end of
01:40:27.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m27s

it which which start out random and so
01:40:29.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m29s

with fries equals with with everything
01:40:33.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m33s

frozen and indeed with pre compute
01:40:36.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m36s

equals true all we're learning is told
01:40:38.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m38s

is those couple of layers that we've
01:40:40.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m40s

added and so with pre compute equals
01:40:42.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m42s

true we actually pretty calculate like
01:40:45.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m45s

how much does this image have something
01:40:47.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m47s

that looks like this a ball one looks
01:40:49.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m49s

like this face and so forth and
01:40:51.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m51s

therefore data augmentation doesn't do
01:40:53.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m53s

anything with pre compute equals true
01:40:55.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m55s

because you know we're actually showing
01:40:56.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m56s

exactly the same activations each time
01:40:59.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h40m59s

we can then set pre compute equals false
01:41:01.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m01s

which means it's still only training
01:41:03.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m03s

those last two layers that we added it's
01:41:06.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m06s

still frozen but data augmentations now
01:41:09.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m09s

working because it's actually going
01:41:11.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m11s

through and recalculating all of the
01:41:12.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m12s

activations from scratch and then
01:41:14.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m14s

finally when we unfreeze that's actually
01:41:17.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m17s

saying okay now you can go ahead and
01:41:19.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m19s

change all of these earlier
01:41:21.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m21s

convolutional filters so well you just
01:41:23.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m23s

so the only reason to have pre compute
01:41:28.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m28s

equals true is it's just much faster so
01:41:31.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m31s

it's like it is it's about you know ten
01:41:33.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m33s

or more times faster so particularly if
01:41:35.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m35s

you're working with like quite a large
01:41:38.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m38s

data set you know it can save quite a
01:41:39.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m39s

bit of time but it's never there's no
01:41:42.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m42s

like companies like accuracy reason ever
01:41:45.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m45s

to use pre computed calls true it's just
01:41:49.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m49s

a it's just a shortcut it's also like
01:41:51.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m51s

quite handy if you're like throwing
01:41:53.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m53s

together a quick model you know it can
01:41:55.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m55s

take a few seconds to create
01:41:57.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h41m57s

my last question which I think you
01:42:01.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m01s

answer is I don't like your suggestions
01:42:03.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m03s

to build a model you have this aged yeah
01:42:07.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m07s

what if would you like we just wanted
01:42:11.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m11s

one initial setting without these like
01:42:15.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m15s

checking after each I mean if you want
01:42:19.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m19s

it like if your question is like is
01:42:24.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m24s

there some shorter version of this
01:42:25.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m25s

that's like a bit quicker and easier I
01:42:27.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m27s

could like to lead a few things here
01:42:29.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m29s

okay I think this is a kind of a minimal
01:42:39.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m39s

version to get you a very good result
01:42:41.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m41s

which is like don't worry about pre
01:42:43.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m43s

compute equals true because that's just
01:42:45.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m45s

saving a little bit of time you know so
01:42:47.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m47s

so I still suggest use LR find at the
01:42:49.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m49s

start to find a good learning rate by
01:42:52.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m52s

default everything is frozen from the
01:42:56.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m56s

start so then you can just go ahead and
01:42:57.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m57s

run two or three epochs or cyclic
01:42:59.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h42m59s

Nichols one unfreeze and then train the
01:43:01.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m01s

rest of the network with differential
01:43:05.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m05s

learning rates so it's basically three
01:43:07.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m07s

steps learning rate finder trained
01:43:09.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m09s

frozen network with cycle methods one
01:43:13.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m13s

and then trained unfrozen network with
01:43:15.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m15s

differential learning rates and cycle
01:43:18.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m18s

molecules too so like that's something
01:43:20.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m20s

you could turn into I guess five or six
01:43:22.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m22s

lines of code at all I think it's a
01:43:26.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m26s

question provide your own mix book by
01:43:30.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m30s

reusing the batch size does the only at
01:43:34.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m34s

better speed of training yeah pretty
01:43:36.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m36s

much so each batch and again we're going
01:43:39.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m39s

to see like all this stuff about
01:43:42.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m42s

precomputing batch sizes we dig into the
01:43:43.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m43s

details of the algorithms it's going to
01:43:45.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m45s

make a lot more sense intuitively but
01:43:47.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m47s

basically if you're showing it less
01:43:49.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m49s

images each time then it's calculating
01:43:53.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m53s

the gradient with less images which
01:43:56.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m56s

means it's less accurate which means
01:43:58.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h43m58s

like knowing which direction to go and
01:44:00.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m00s

how far to go in that direction is less
01:44:02.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m02s

accurate so as you make the batch size
01:44:04.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m04s

smaller
01:44:06.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m06s

you're basically making it kind of more
01:44:07.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m07s

volatile it's
01:44:09.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m09s

kind of like it kind of impacts the
01:44:11.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m11s

optimal learning rate that you would
01:44:18.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m18s

need to use but in practice where only
01:44:20.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m20s

you know I generally find only dividing
01:44:22.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m22s

with the batch size by like 2 or 4 it
01:44:24.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m24s

doesn't seem to change things very much
01:44:26.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m26s

should I reveals the learning rate of
01:44:28.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m28s

quality me if you if you change the
01:44:30.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m30s

batch size by much you can rerun the
01:44:33.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m33s

learning rate finder to see if it's
01:44:34.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m34s

changed if I match but it it I was in
01:44:36.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m36s

for only generally looking at like a
01:44:38.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m38s

power of 10 it probably is not going to
01:44:40.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m40s

change the it's not that you can't
01:44:42.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m42s

because plus back there
01:44:43.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m43s

this is sort of a conceptual basic
01:44:48.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m48s

questions we're going back to the
01:44:50.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m50s

previous night where you should put in
01:44:51.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m51s

the thought behind sorry yeah this is
01:44:53.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m53s

well one for conceptual so a basic
01:44:55.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m55s

question we've actually really slide
01:44:57.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m57s

where you should what the different
01:44:59.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h44m59s

layers were doing yes from this slide I
01:45:01.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m01s

understand right the meaning of sync the
01:45:07.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m07s

third column relative to the fourth
01:45:11.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m11s

column is that what you're interpreting
01:45:12.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m12s

what the layer is doing based on what
01:45:16.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m16s

the image is actually yeah so we're
01:45:19.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m19s

going to look at this in more detail so
01:45:23.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m23s

these these gray ones basically say this
01:45:24.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m24s

is kind of what the filter looks like so
01:45:26.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m26s

on the first layer you can see exactly
01:45:28.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m28s

what the filter looks like because the
01:45:31.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m31s

input to it of pixels right so you can
01:45:32.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m32s

absolutely say and remember we looked at
01:45:34.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m34s

what a convolutional kernel was like was
01:45:36.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m36s

that three by three thing so this look
01:45:38.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m38s

like there's seven by seven kernels you
01:45:41.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m41s

can say this is actually what it looks
01:45:43.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m43s

like but later on it's combined you know
01:45:44.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m44s

the the the input to it are themselves
01:45:47.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m47s

activations which are combinations of
01:45:50.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m50s

activations relation to activations so
01:45:52.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m52s

you can't draw it but there's clever
01:45:54.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m54s

technique that I learned focus created
01:45:56.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m56s

which allowed them to say this is kind
01:45:58.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h45m58s

of what the filters tended to look like
01:46:00.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m00s

on average alright so this is kind of
01:46:02.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m02s

what the photos look like and then here
01:46:04.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m04s

is specific examples of patches of image
01:46:06.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m06s

which activated that filter highly so
01:46:10.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m10s

yet the pictures are the ones that I
01:46:14.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m14s

kind of find more useful because it
01:46:16.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m16s

tells you this kernel is kind of a mini
01:46:17.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m17s

cycle we all find right how do we know
01:46:21.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m21s

that's it well we'll come back well we
01:46:35.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m35s

may come back to that if not in this
01:46:40.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m40s

part in the next part that probably a
01:46:41.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m41s

part two actually because this paper
01:46:45.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m45s

this paper uses to create these things
01:46:48.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m48s

this paper uses something called a
01:46:49.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m49s

deconvolution which I'm pretty sure we
01:46:50.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m50s

won't do in this part but we will do it
01:46:53.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m53s

in part two so if you're interested
01:46:54.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m54s

check out the paper it's it's in the
01:46:57.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h46m57s

notebook has a link to it xyler in
01:47:00.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m00s

Fergus it's a very clever technique and
01:47:01.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m01s

not terribly intuitive
01:47:06.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m06s

um right so so you mentioned that it was
01:47:10.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m10s

good that the dog took up the full
01:47:18.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m18s

picture and it would have been a problem
01:47:20.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m20s

if it was kind of like off in one of the
01:47:22.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m22s

corners in really tiny well what would
01:47:24.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m24s

you what would you technique have been
01:47:27.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m27s

to try to make that work something that
01:47:29.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m29s

we'll learn about in part two but
01:47:34.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m34s

basically there's a technique that
01:47:36.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m36s

allows you to to kind of figure out
01:47:38.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m38s

roughly which parts of an image and most
01:47:41.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m41s

likely to have the interesting things in
01:47:43.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m43s

them and then you can like crop out
01:47:45.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m45s

those bits if you're interested in
01:47:47.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m47s

learning about it we did cover it
01:47:50.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m50s

briefly in lesson seven of part one but
01:47:52.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m52s

I'm going to actually do it properly in
01:47:55.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m55s

part two of this course because I didn't
01:47:58.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h47m58s

really cover it thoroughly enough maybe
01:48:01.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m01s

we'll find time to have a quick look at
01:48:06.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m06s

it but we'll see I know your Nets
01:48:07.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m07s

written some of the code that we need
01:48:10.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m10s

already
01:48:11.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m11s

ah
01:48:13.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m13s

so once I have something like this
01:48:16.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m16s

notebook that's basically working I can
01:48:18.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m18s

immediately make it better by doing two
01:48:24.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m24s

things assuming that the size image I
01:48:28.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m28s

was using is smaller than the average
01:48:32.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m32s

size of the image that we've been given
01:48:34.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m34s

I can increase the size and as I showed
01:48:35.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m35s

before with the dog breeds you can
01:48:38.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m38s

actually increase it during training the
01:48:40.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m40s

other thing I can do is to create is to
01:48:42.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m42s

use a better architecture now an
01:48:45.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m45s

architect we're going to talk a lot in
01:48:48.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m48s

this course about architectures but
01:48:49.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m49s

basically there are different ways of
01:48:51.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m51s

putting together like what size
01:48:58.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h48m58s

convolutional filters and how are they
01:49:00.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m00s

connected to each other and so forth and
01:49:02.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m02s

different architectures have different
01:49:05.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m05s

like numbers of layers and sizes of
01:49:07.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m07s

kernels and number of filters and so
01:49:09.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m09s

forth and so there are some the one that
01:49:11.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m11s

we've been using ResNet 34 is a great
01:49:16.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m16s

starting point and often a good
01:49:19.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m19s

finishing point because it's like it's
01:49:21.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m21s

pretty it doesn't have too many
01:49:23.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m23s

parameters often it works pretty well
01:49:25.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m25s

with small amounts of data as we've seen
01:49:27.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m27s

and so forth but there's actually an
01:49:28.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m28s

architecture that I really like called
01:49:32.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m32s

not res net but res next which was
01:49:34.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m34s

actually the second-place winner in last
01:49:37.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m37s

year's image net competition and like
01:49:39.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m39s

ResNet you can put a number after the
01:49:44.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m44s

res next to say like how big it is and
01:49:46.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m46s

like my next step after resume 34 is
01:49:49.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m49s

always res next 50 now you'll find res
01:49:52.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m52s

next 50 takes like can take like twice
01:49:55.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m55s

as long as ResNet 34 that can take like
01:49:58.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h49m58s

2 to 4 times as much memory as retina 34
01:50:01.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m01s

so what I wanted to do was I wanted to
01:50:06.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m06s

rerun that previous notebook with res
01:50:08.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m08s

next and increasing the image size to
01:50:10.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m10s

turn on a node so here I just said
01:50:12.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m12s

architecture equals res next 50 size
01:50:15.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m15s

equals 299 and then I found that I had
01:50:18.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m18s

to take the batch size all the way back
01:50:20.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m20s

to 28 to get it to fit my GPU is 11 gig
01:50:21.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m21s

if you're using AWS or cresol I think
01:50:25.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m25s

they're like 12 gigs they might be
01:50:27.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m27s

a bit higher but this is what I found I
01:50:30.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m30s

had to do so then I this is literally a
01:50:32.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m32s

copy of the previous notebook so you can
01:50:34.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m34s

actually go file make a copy right and
01:50:36.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m36s

then rerun it with with these different
01:50:39.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m39s

parameters and so I deleted some of the
01:50:41.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m41s

pros and some of the expiratory stuff to
01:50:45.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m45s

see you know basically I said everything
01:50:47.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m47s

else is the same all the same steps as
01:50:49.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m49s

before there's my in fact you can kind
01:50:52.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m52s

of see what this minimum service desk
01:50:54.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m54s

looks like I didn't need to worry about
01:50:55.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m55s

learning rate finder so I just left it
01:50:57.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m57s

as is so transforms data equals loan
01:50:59.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h50m59s

equals bit pre computed false feet with
01:51:02.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m02s

cycle integrals one and freeze
01:51:06.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m06s

differential learning rates bits and
01:51:08.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m08s

more and you can see here I didn't do
01:51:12.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m12s

the cycle mop thing because I found like
01:51:14.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m14s

now that I'm using a bigger architecture
01:51:17.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m17s

it's got more parameters it was
01:51:19.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m19s

overfitting pretty quickly so rather
01:51:21.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m21s

than like cycle length equals one never
01:51:23.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m23s

finding the right spot it actually did
01:51:25.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m25s

find the right spot and if I used longer
01:51:28.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m28s

cycle legs I found that my validation
01:51:29.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m29s

error was higher than my training error
01:51:34.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m34s

it was over there so check us out though
01:51:37.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m37s

by using these you know three steps
01:51:40.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m40s

I got plus TTA 99.75
01:51:43.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m43s

so what does that mean that means I have
01:51:47.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m47s

one incorrect dog for incorrect cats and
01:51:50.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m50s

when we look at the pictures of them my
01:51:54.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m54s

incorrect dog has a cat now this one is
01:51:58.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h51m58s

not a either this one is not either so
01:52:02.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m02s

I've actually got one mistake and then
01:52:04.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m04s

my incorrect dog is teeth right so like
01:52:07.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m07s

we're at a point where we're now able to
01:52:12.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m12s

train a classifier that's so good that
01:52:15.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m15s

it has like basically one's dead right
01:52:18.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m18s

and so when people say like we have
01:52:23.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m23s

superhuman image performance now this is
01:52:25.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m25s

kind of what they're talking about right
01:52:27.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m27s

so did you actually when I looked at the
01:52:29.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m29s

dog breed one I did this morning I was
01:52:31.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m31s

like it was it was getting the dog
01:52:34.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m34s

breeds much better than I ever could
01:52:36.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m36s

so like hits this this is what we can
01:52:39.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m39s

get to if you use a really modern
01:52:42.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m42s

architect
01:52:43.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m43s

like redneck and this suddenly took out
01:52:44.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m44s

a tall way and remember don't like 20
01:52:48.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m48s

minutes to Train so that's kind of where
01:52:51.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m51s

we're up to so if you want to do
01:52:55.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h52m55s

satellite imagery
01:53:02.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m02s

instead right then it's the same thing
01:53:04.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m04s

and in fact the the planet satellite
01:53:07.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m07s

data sets already oh and Chris or if
01:53:09.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m09s

you're using Chris or you can jump
01:53:11.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m11s

straight there right and I just went
01:53:12.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m12s

into this data stash planet and I can do
01:53:17.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m17s

exactly the same thing right I can image
01:53:20.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m20s

classifier from CSV right and you can
01:53:25.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m25s

see these three lines are actually
01:53:28.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m28s

exactly the same as my dog breed lines
01:53:30.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m30s

you know how big how many lines are in
01:53:31.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m31s

the file grab my validation indexes this
01:53:34.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m34s

get data as you can see it's identical
01:53:37.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m37s

except I've changed side on to top down
01:53:38.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m38s

the satellite images about top down so I
01:53:42.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m42s

can fit them vertically and they still
01:53:44.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m44s

make sense right and so you can see here
01:53:47.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m47s

I'm doing this trick round back to size
01:53:49.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m49s

equals 64 and train a little bit first
01:53:51.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m51s

learning rate find on right and
01:53:55.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m55s

interestingly in this case you can see
01:53:57.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m57s

it I want really high learning rates I
01:53:59.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h53m59s

don't know what it is about this
01:54:01.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m01s

particular data set this is true but
01:54:03.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m03s

it's clearly I can use super high
01:54:05.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m05s

learning rate so I use a lot here at a
01:54:07.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m07s

point too and so I've trained for a
01:54:08.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m08s

while
01:54:12.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m12s

differential learning rates right and so
01:54:13.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m13s

remember I said like if the data sets
01:54:16.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m16s

very different to image net I probably
01:54:18.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m18s

want to train those middle layers a lot
01:54:20.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m20s

more so I'm using divided by three
01:54:23.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m23s

rather than divided by ten all right the
01:54:25.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m25s

other than that is the same thing cycle
01:54:27.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m27s

Nauticals - all right and then I just
01:54:28.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m28s

kind of keep an eye on it so you can
01:54:33.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m33s

actually plot the loss if you go and
01:54:34.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m34s

learned up shared a plot loss you can
01:54:35.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m35s

see here that here's the first cycle is
01:54:37.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m37s

the second cycle is the third cycle
01:54:40.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m40s

right so you can see it gets better pops
01:54:43.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m43s

out gets better pops out if better pops
01:54:45.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m45s

out and each time it finds something
01:54:46.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m46s

better than the last time
01:54:48.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m48s

then set the size up to 128 and just
01:54:50.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m50s

repeat exactly the last few steps and
01:54:53.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m53s

then set up to 256
01:54:55.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m55s

repeat the last two steps and then do
01:54:58.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h54m58s

TTA and if you submit this and this gets
01:55:02.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m02s

about 30th place in this competition so
01:55:05.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m05s

these basic steps work super well this
01:55:10.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m10s

this thing where I went all the way back
01:55:12.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m12s

to a size of 64 I wouldn't do that if I
01:55:14.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m14s

was doing like dogs and cats or dog
01:55:19.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m19s

breeds because like this is so small
01:55:21.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m21s

that if if the thing I was working on is
01:55:23.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m23s

very similar to imagenet I would kind of
01:55:26.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m26s

destroy those imagenet weights like 64
01:55:29.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m29s

by 64 is so small but in this case the
01:55:32.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m32s

satellite imagery data it's so different
01:55:34.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m34s

to imagenet um you know I really found
01:55:36.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m36s

that it worked pretty well
01:55:38.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m38s

start right back to these tiny images it
01:55:39.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m39s

really helped me to avoid overfitting
01:55:43.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m43s

and interestingly using this kind of
01:55:45.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m45s

approach I actually found that even with
01:55:48.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m48s

using only 128 by 128 I was getting like
01:55:50.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m50s

much better cackled results than really
01:55:53.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m53s

everybody on the leader board
01:55:55.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m55s

and when I say 30th place this is a very
01:55:57.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h55m57s

recent competition right and so I find
01:56:00.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m00s

like in the last year like a lot of
01:56:02.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m02s

people have got a lot better at computer
01:56:05.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m05s

vision and so the people in the top 50
01:56:07.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m07s

in this competition were generally
01:56:09.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m09s

ensemble in dozens of models lots of
01:56:10.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m10s

people on a team lots of pre-processing
01:56:13.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m13s

specific satellite data and so forth so
01:56:15.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m15s

like to be able to get xxx using this
01:56:18.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m18s

totally standard technique is pretty
01:56:21.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m21s

cool
01:56:22.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m22s

alright so now that we've got to this
01:56:24.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m24s

point right we've got through two
01:56:28.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m28s

lessons if you're still here then
01:56:29.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m29s

hopefully you're thinking okay this is
01:56:32.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m32s

actually pretty useful I want to do more
01:56:35.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m35s

in which case Kressel might not be where
01:56:37.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m37s

you want to stay the issues with Kressel
01:56:41.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m41s

I mean it's it's it's pretty handy it's
01:56:43.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m43s

pretty cheap and something we haven't
01:56:45.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m45s

talked about much is paper space is
01:56:47.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m47s

another great choice by the way paper
01:56:50.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m50s

space are short they're going to be
01:56:52.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m52s

releasing kress or like instant Drupal
01:56:53.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m53s

notebooks unfortunately they're not
01:56:55.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m55s

ready quite yet but they do have an
01:56:57.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m57s

ability to basically they have the best
01:56:59.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h56m59s

price performance relationship right now
01:57:01.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m01s

and they you can SSH into them and use
01:57:04.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m04s

them so they're also a great choice and
01:57:08.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m08s

probably by the time this
01:57:10.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m10s

the MOOC will probably have a separate
01:57:11.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m11s

lesson showing you how to set up set up
01:57:13.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m13s

paper space because there they're likely
01:57:15.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m15s

to be a great option but at some point
01:57:18.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m18s

you're probably going to want to look at
01:57:20.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m20s

AWS a couple of reasons why the first is
01:57:21.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m21s

as you all know by now amazon have been
01:57:26.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m26s

kind enough to donate about $200,000
01:57:30.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m30s

worth of compute time to this course so
01:57:33.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m33s

I want to say thank you very much to
01:57:35.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m35s

Amazon we've all been given credit so
01:57:37.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m37s

everybody this year so thanks very much
01:57:40.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m40s

hey don't worry we're so sorry you're
01:57:42.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m42s

sure in the MOOC we didn't get it for
01:57:46.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m46s

you but everybody here is like AWS
01:57:48.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m48s

credits for everybody so um but you can
01:57:50.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m50s

get even if you're not here in person
01:57:53.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m53s

you can get AWS credits from lots of
01:57:55.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m55s

places github has a student pack Google
01:57:57.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h57m57s

for github student pack that's like 150
01:58:00.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m00s

bucks worth of credits AWS educate can
01:58:02.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m02s

get credits these our office students so
01:58:05.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m05s

there's lots of places you can get
01:58:08.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m08s

started on AWS pretty much everybody
01:58:09.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m09s

everybody a lot of the people that you
01:58:13.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m13s

might work with will be using AWS
01:58:15.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m15s

because it's like super flexible right
01:58:18.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m18s

now AWS has the fastest available GPUs
01:58:21.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m21s

you can get in the cloud they're p3s
01:58:25.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m25s

they're kind of expensive at three bucks
01:58:28.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m28s

an hour but if you've got like a model
01:58:31.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m31s

where you've done all the steps before
01:58:32.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m32s

you're thinking this is looking pretty
01:58:34.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m34s

good you know for 6 bucks you could get
01:58:35.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m35s

a p3 for 2 hours and run turbo speed
01:58:38.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m38s

right um we didn't start with AWS
01:58:41.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m41s

because well hey it's like twice as
01:58:45.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m45s

expensive as Chris Hall for the cheapest
01:58:48.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m48s

GPU and being a Texan setup right but I
01:58:49.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m49s

wanted to kind of go through and show
01:58:54.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m54s

you how to get your AWS setup and so
01:58:57.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m57s

we're going to be going slightly over
01:58:59.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h58m59s

time to do that but I want to show you a
01:59:01.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m01s

very quick place I feel prettier if you
01:59:03.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m03s

have to but I want to show you very
01:59:05.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m05s

quickly how you can get your AWS setup
01:59:07.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m07s

right from scratch so basically you have
01:59:10.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m10s

to go to consult on AWS but amazon.com
01:59:14.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m14s

and it'll take you to the console right
01:59:17.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m17s

and so you can follow along on the video
01:59:19.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m19s

with this
01:59:22.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m22s

quickly from here you have to go to AC -
01:59:23.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m23s

this is where you set up your instances
01:59:27.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m27s

and so from ec2 you need to do what's
01:59:29.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m29s

called launching an instance so
01:59:33.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m33s

launching an instance means you're
01:59:35.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m35s

basically creating a computer right now
01:59:36.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m36s

creating a computer on Amazon so I say
01:59:38.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m38s

launch instance and what we've done is
01:59:41.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m41s

we've created a fast AI it's got an amo
01:59:44.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m44s

and ami is like a template for how your
01:59:47.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m47s

computer's going to begin so if you've
01:59:49.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m49s

got a community a Mis and type in fast
01:59:51.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m51s

AI you'll see that there's one there
01:59:54.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m54s

called fast AI part 1 version 2 for the
01:59:56.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=01h59m56s

p2 ok so I'm going to select that and
02:00:00.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m00s

then we need to say what kind of
02:00:04.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m04s

computer do you want and so I can say I
02:00:06.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m06s

want a GPU compute computer and then I
02:00:08.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m08s

can say I want a p2 x large this is the
02:00:13.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m13s

cheapest reasonably effective for deep
02:00:16.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m16s

learning instance type they have and
02:00:19.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m19s

then I can say launch and then I can say
02:00:21.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m21s

launch and so at this point they asked
02:00:25.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m25s

you to choose a key pair right now
02:00:29.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m29s

if you don't have a key pair you have to
02:00:33.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m33s

create one right so to create a key pair
02:00:35.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m35s

you need to open your terminal if you
02:00:39.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m39s

don't have a terminal if you've got a
02:00:44.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m44s

Mac or Linux box you've definitely got
02:00:47.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m47s

one if you've got Windows hopefully
02:00:48.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m48s

you've got Ubuntu if you don't already
02:00:50.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m50s

have Ubuntu setup you can go to the
02:00:53.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m53s

Windows Store and click on Ubuntu right
02:00:56.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h00m56s

we'll get it from the Windows Store so
02:01:01.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m01s

from there you basically go SSH
02:01:04.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m04s

- caged in and that will create like a
02:01:08.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m08s

special password for your computer to be
02:01:12.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m12s

able to log in to Amazon and then you
02:01:15.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m15s

just hit enter three times okay and
02:01:16.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m16s

that's going to create for you your key
02:01:19.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m19s

you can use to get into Amazon alright
02:01:22.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m22s

so then what I do is I copy that key
02:01:24.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m24s

somewhere that I know where it is so
02:01:26.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m26s

it'll be in the dot SSH folder
02:01:28.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m28s

it's called IDRs a dub and so I'm going
02:01:30.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m30s

to copy it to my hard drive so if you're
02:01:33.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m33s

in a macro and Linux it'll already be in
02:01:39.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m39s

an easy to find place it'll be in your
02:01:41.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m41s

SSH folder that in documents so from
02:01:42.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m42s

there back in AWS you have to tell it
02:01:49.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m49s

that you've created this key so you can
02:01:53.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m53s

go to key pairs and you say import key
02:01:55.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m55s

pair and you just browse to that file
02:01:59.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h01m59s

that you just created there it is
02:02:02.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m02s

I say import okay so if you've ever used
02:02:06.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m06s

SSH before you've already got the key
02:02:11.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m11s

pair you don't have to do those depths
02:02:13.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m13s

if you've used AWS before you've already
02:02:14.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m14s

imported it you don't have to do that
02:02:17.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m17s

step maybe haven't done any of those
02:02:18.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m18s

things you have to do both steps so now
02:02:20.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m20s

I can go ahead and launch my instance
02:02:24.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m24s

community I am eyes search last day I
02:02:30.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m30s

select launch and so now it asks me
02:02:35.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m35s

what's where's your key pair and I can
02:02:41.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m41s

choose that one that I just grabbed okay
02:02:43.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m43s

so this is going to go ahead and create
02:02:48.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m48s

a new computer for me to log into and
02:02:51.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m51s

you can see here it says the following
02:02:55.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m55s

have been initiated and so if I click on
02:02:56.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m56s

that it'll show me this new computer
02:02:58.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h02m58s

that I've created okay so it'll be able
02:03:02.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m02s

to log into it
02:03:05.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m05s

I need to know its IP address so here it
02:03:08.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m08s

is the IP address there okay so I can
02:03:11.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m11s

copy that and that's the IP address of
02:03:14.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m14s

my computer so to get to this computer I
02:03:17.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m17s

need to SSH to it so SSH into a computer
02:03:20.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m20s

means connecting to that computer so
02:03:23.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m23s

that it's like you're typing in that
02:03:25.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m25s

computer so I type SSH and they username
02:03:26.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m26s

for this instance is always Ubuntu right
02:03:29.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m29s

and then I can paste in that IP address
02:03:33.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m33s

and then there's one more thing I have
02:03:36.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m36s

to do which is I have to connect up the
02:03:38.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m38s

jupiter notebook on that instance to the
02:03:41.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m41s

jupiter notebook on my machine and so to
02:03:44.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m44s

do that there's just a particular flag
02:03:46.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m46s

that i said okay we can talk about it on
02:03:48.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m48s

the forums as to exactly what it does
02:03:50.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m50s

but you just type - l.a today date
02:03:52.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m52s

localhost 8 8 8 8 ok so like once you've
02:03:55.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m55s

done it once you can like save that as
02:03:59.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h03m59s

an alias and type in the same thing
02:04:01.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m01s

every time
02:04:03.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m03s

so we can check here we can see it says
02:04:05.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m05s

that it's running so we should be able
02:04:07.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m07s

to now hit enter first time ever which
02:04:09.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m09s

sit reconnect to it it does checks this
02:04:12.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m12s

is okay I'll say yes and then that goes
02:04:14.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m14s

ahead and SSH is in so this ami is all
02:04:19.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m19s

set up for you alright so you'll find
02:04:27.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m27s

that the very first time you log in it
02:04:29.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m29s

takes a few extra seconds because it
02:04:31.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m31s

just kind of is getting everything set
02:04:32.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m32s

up but once it's logged in you'll see
02:04:34.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m34s

there that there's a directory called
02:04:36.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m36s

fast AI and the fast AI directory
02:04:38.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m38s

contains our fast AI repo that contains
02:04:41.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m41s

all the notebooks or the code etc so I
02:04:45.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m45s

can just go CD faster all right first
02:04:48.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m48s

thing you do when you get in is to make
02:04:51.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m51s

sure it's updated so you just go git
02:04:53.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m53s

pull right and that updates to make sure
02:04:55.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m55s

that your repo is the same as the most
02:04:59.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h04m59s

recent video and so as you can see there
02:05:01.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m01s

we go
02:05:05.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m05s

let's make sure it's got all the most
02:05:05.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m05s

recent code the second thing you should
02:05:06.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m06s

do is type Condor and update you can
02:05:08.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m08s

just do this maybe once a month or so
02:05:11.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m11s

and that makes sure that the libraries
02:05:13.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m13s

there are all the most recent libraries
02:05:15.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m15s

I'm not going to run that so it takes a
02:05:17.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m17s

couple of minutes okay
02:05:19.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m19s

and then the last step is to type
02:05:20.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m20s

particular notebook okay
02:05:22.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m22s

so this is going to go ahead and launch
02:05:26.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m26s

the triplet notebook server on this
02:05:29.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m29s

machine again the first time I do it the
02:05:32.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m32s

first time you do everything on AWS
02:05:35.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m35s

it just takes like a minute or two and
02:05:37.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m37s

then once you've done it in the future
02:05:40.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m40s

we just as fast as running it locally
02:05:42.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m42s

basically okay so you can see it's going
02:05:44.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m44s

ahead and firing out the notebook and so
02:05:47.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m47s

what's going to happen is that because
02:05:49.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m49s

when we SSH into it we said to both
02:05:51.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m51s

connect our notebook port to the remote
02:05:53.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m53s

notebook port we're just going to be
02:05:56.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m56s

able to use this locally so I see he
02:05:58.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h05m58s

says here copy paste this URL so I'm
02:06:00.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m00s

going to grab that URL and I'm going to
02:06:03.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m03s

paste it into my browser and that's it
02:06:06.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m06s

okay so this notebook is now actually
02:06:11.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m11s

not running on my machine it's actually
02:06:15.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m15s

running on AWS okay using the AWS GPU
02:06:17.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m17s

it's got a lot of memory it's not the
02:06:21.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m21s

fastest around but it's not terrible
02:06:23.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m23s

you can always fire up a p3 if you want
02:06:25.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m25s

something that's super fast this is
02:06:28.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m28s

costing me ninety cents a minute okay so
02:06:30.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m30s

when you're finished please don't forget
02:06:33.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m33s

to shut it down right so to shut it down
02:06:36.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m36s

you can right-click on it and say
02:06:38.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m38s

instance date stop okay we've got five
02:06:43.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m43s

hundred bucks of credit assuming that
02:06:48.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m48s

first time I showed you this by the way
02:06:55.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m55s

I said make sure you choose a p2 the
02:06:57.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h06m57s

second time I went through I didn't
02:07:02.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxcznsrRb8#t=02h07m02s

choose p2 by mistake so just don't
