[I thought what we might do today is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m00s)
00:00:00

[like finish off where we were in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m04s)
00:00:04

[Russman noteblock looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m08s)
00:00:08

[timeseriesforecasting and structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m11s)
00:00:11

[data analysis and then we might do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m14s)
00:00:14

[little mini review of like everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m17s)
00:00:17

[we've learned because believe it or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m22s)
00:00:22

[this is the end like there's nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m24s)
00:00:24

[more to know about machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m27s)
00:00:27

[rather than everything that you're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m28s)
00:00:28

[to learn next semester and for the rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m30s)
00:00:30

[of your life there anyway I got nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m34s)
00:00:34

[else to teach ya so I'll do a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m37s)
00:00:37

[review and and then we'll cover like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m41s)
00:00:41

[most important part of the course which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m43s)
00:00:43

[is like thinking about like what are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m45s)
00:00:45

[what what of how are ways to think about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m48s)
00:00:48

[how to use this kind of technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m50s)
00:00:50

[appropriately and you know effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m52s)
00:00:52

[in a way that's a positive hopefully a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m56s)
00:00:56

[positive impact on society so last time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h00m58s)
00:00:58

[we got to the point where we talked a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m02s)
00:01:02

[bit about this site this idea that when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m05s)
00:01:05

[we were looking at like building this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m08s)
00:01:08

[competition months open derived variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m10s)
00:01:10

[but we actually truncated it down to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m14s)
00:01:14

[no more than 24 months and we talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m16s)
00:01:16

[about the reason why being that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m18s)
00:01:18

[actually wanted to use it as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m20s)
00:01:20

[categorical variable because categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m21s)
00:01:21

[variables thanks to embeddings have more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m24s)
00:01:24

[flexibility in how the neural net can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m27s)
00:01:27

[can use them and so that was kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m29s)
00:01:29

[where we where we left off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m33s)
00:01:33

[so let's like keep working through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m36s)
00:01:36

[because what's happening in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m39s)
00:01:39

[notebook is stuff which is probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m43s)
00:01:43

[going to apply to most time series data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[sets that you work with right and as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m49s)
00:01:49

[talked about like although we used the F](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m54s)
00:01:54

[dot apply here this is something where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m56s)
00:01:56

[it's running a piece of Python code over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h01m58s)
00:01:58

[every row and it's that's terrifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m01s)
00:02:01

[slow right so we only do that if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m04s)
00:02:04

[can't find a vectorized pandas or numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m07s)
00:02:07

[function that can do it too the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[column at once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m12s)
00:02:12

[but in this case I couldn't find a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m14s)
00:02:14

[to convert a year and a week number into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m16s)
00:02:16

[a date without using arbitrary Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m21s)
00:02:21

[also worth remembering this idea of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m27s)
00:02:27

[lambda function anytime you're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m31s)
00:02:31

[apply a function to every row of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m34s)
00:02:34

[something or every element of a tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m36s)
00:02:36

[or something like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m38s)
00:02:38

[if there isn't a vectorized version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m39s)
00:02:39

[already you're going to have to call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m42s)
00:02:42

[something like data frame dot apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m44s)
00:02:44

[which will run a function you pass to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[every element so this is something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m49s)
00:02:49

[you know kind of this is basically a map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[in functional programming since very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h02m56s)
00:02:56

[often the function that you want to pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m00s)
00:03:00

[to it is something you're just going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m02s)
00:03:02

[use once and then throw it away it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m03s)
00:03:03

[really common to use this lambda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m06s)
00:03:06

[approach so this lambda is creating a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m08s)
00:03:08

[function just for the purpose of telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m11s)
00:03:11

[DF not apply what to use right so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[could we could also have written this in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m17s)
00:03:17

[a different way which would have been to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m20s)
00:03:20

[say define create from o2 since on some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[value return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m39s)
00:03:39

[and then we put that in here okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h03m48s)
00:03:48

[that and that are the same thing okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m06s)
00:04:06

[one approach is to define the function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[and then pass it by name or the other is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m11s)
00:04:11

[to define the function in place using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m14s)
00:04:14

[lambda all right and so if you're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m16s)
00:04:16

[comfortable creating and using lambdas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m20s)
00:04:20

[you know good thing to practice and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m23s)
00:04:23

[playing around at the F dot apply as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m25s)
00:04:25

[good way to good way to practice it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[so let's talk about this durations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m32s)
00:04:32

[section which may at first seem a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m35s)
00:04:35

[specific but actually it turns out not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m42s)
00:04:42

[to be what we're going to do is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m45s)
00:04:45

[going to look at three fields promot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m47s)
00:04:47

[state holiday and school holiday and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m51s)
00:04:51

[basically what we have is a table of for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m55s)
00:04:55

[each store for each date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h04m59s)
00:04:59

[that's that store have a promo going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m02s)
00:05:02

[at that date is there a school holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m05s)
00:05:05

[in that region of that store of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m08s)
00:05:08

[date is there a state holiday in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m11s)
00:05:11

[region for that store at that date okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m14s)
00:05:14

[and so this kind of thing is you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m16s)
00:05:16

[like their events and time series with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m21s)
00:05:21

[events are like very very common like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m24s)
00:05:24

[you're looking at oil and gas drilling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m26s)
00:05:26

[data you're trying to say like the flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m29s)
00:05:29

[through this pipe you know here's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m31s)
00:05:31

[event representing when it set off some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[alarm you know or here's an event where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m36s)
00:05:36

[the drill got stuck or or whatever right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m39s)
00:05:39

[and so like most time series at some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m42s)
00:05:42

[level will tend to represent some events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m45s)
00:05:45

[so the fact that an event happened at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m48s)
00:05:48

[time is is interesting itself but very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m54s)
00:05:54

[often a time series will also show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h05m58s)
00:05:58

[some something happening before and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m01s)
00:06:01

[after the event so for example in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m03s)
00:06:03

[case we're doing grocery sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m06s)
00:06:06

[prediction if there's a holiday coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m08s)
00:06:08

[up it's quite likely that sales will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m11s)
00:06:11

[higher before and after the holiday and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m14s)
00:06:14

[lower during the holiday if this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m17s)
00:06:17

[City based store right because you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m20s)
00:06:20

[you're gonna you've got to stock up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m23s)
00:06:23

[before you go away to bring things with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m24s)
00:06:24

[you then when you come back you've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m27s)
00:06:27

[refill the fridge for instance right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m29s)
00:06:29

[it's alone like we don't necessarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m34s)
00:06:34

[have to do this kind of feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m37s)
00:06:37

[engineering to create features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m39s)
00:06:39

[specifically about like this is before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m41s)
00:06:41

[or after a holiday that the neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m43s)
00:06:43

[you know the more we can give the neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m47s)
00:06:47

[that like the kind of information it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m49s)
00:06:49

[needs the less it's going to have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m51s)
00:06:51

[learn it the less that it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m53s)
00:06:53

[have to learn it the more we can do with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m55s)
00:06:55

[the data or we already have the more we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m57s)
00:06:57

[can do with the you know the size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h06m59s)
00:06:59

[architecture we already have so future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m02s)
00:07:02

[engineering even even with stuff like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m04s)
00:07:04

[neural nets is still important because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m06s)
00:07:06

[it means that you know we'll be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m10s)
00:07:10

[do you know get better results with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m12s)
00:07:12

[whatever limited data we have whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m15s)
00:07:15

[limited computation we have so the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m17s)
00:07:17

[idea here therefore is when we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m21s)
00:07:21

[events in our time series is we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m24s)
00:07:24

[create two new columns for each event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m26s)
00:07:26

[how long is it going to be until the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m29s)
00:07:29

[next time this event happens and how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m32s)
00:07:32

[long has it been since the last time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m34s)
00:07:34

[that event happened so in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m36s)
00:07:36

[how long until the next state holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m38s)
00:07:38

[how long since the previous state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m40s)
00:07:40

[holiday okay so that's not something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m42s)
00:07:42

[which I'm aware of as existing as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m46s)
00:07:46

[library or anything like that so we I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m49s)
00:07:49

[wrote up here by hand right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m52s)
00:07:52

[importantly I need to do this by store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m55s)
00:07:55

[right so I want to say like because you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[know for this store when was this stores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m02s)
00:08:02

[last promo so how long has it been since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m05s)
00:08:05

[the last time it had a promo how long it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m08s)
00:08:08

[will be until the next time it has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m10s)
00:08:10

[promo for instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[all right so here's what I'm going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m15s)
00:08:15

[I'm gonna create a little function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[that's going to take a field name and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m22s)
00:08:22

[I'm going to pass it a chive promo and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m25s)
00:08:25

[then state holiday and then school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[holiday all right so let's do school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m28s)
00:08:28

[holiday for example so we'll say field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[equals school holiday and then we'll say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m31s)
00:08:31

[get elapsed school holiday comma after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m35s)
00:08:35

[so let me show you what that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m39s)
00:08:39

[do so we've got a first of all sort by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m41s)
00:08:41

[store and date right so now when we loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m44s)
00:08:44

[through this we're going to be looping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m47s)
00:08:47

[through within a store so store number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m49s)
00:08:49

[one January the first journey the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m51s)
00:08:51

[January third and so forth and as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m53s)
00:08:53

[look through each store we're basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m57s)
00:08:57

[going to say like is is this row a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h08m59s)
00:08:59

[school holiday or not and if it is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m04s)
00:09:04

[school holiday then we'll keep track of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m05s)
00:09:05

[this variable called last date which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m07s)
00:09:07

[says this is the last date and which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m10s)
00:09:10

[where we saw a school holiday okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m12s)
00:09:12

[so then we're basically going to append](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m15s)
00:09:15

[to our result the number of days since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m17s)
00:09:17

[the last school holiday that's the kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m21s)
00:09:21

[of basic idea here so there's a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m24s)
00:09:24

[interesting features one is the use of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[zip right so I could actually write this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m30s)
00:09:30

[much more simply right I could say let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m33s)
00:09:33

[go through well we could basically go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m40s)
00:09:40

[through like four row in DF get a rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m43s)
00:09:43

[right and then grab the the fields we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[want from each row it turns out this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[300 times slower than the version that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h09m57s)
00:09:57

[have and basically like iterating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[through a data frame and extracting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m03s)
00:10:03

[specific fields out of a row has a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m07s)
00:10:07

[of overhead what's much faster is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m13s)
00:10:13

[iterate through a numpy array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m16s)
00:10:16

[so if you take a series like the F store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m21s)
00:10:21

[and add values after it that grabs a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m24s)
00:10:24

[numpy array of that series okay so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m27s)
00:10:27

[are three numpy arrays one is the store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m31s)
00:10:31

[IDs one is whatever field is in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m33s)
00:10:33

[case that's a school holiday and what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m38s)
00:10:38

[the date so now what I want to want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m41s)
00:10:41

[do is look through the first one of each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m44s)
00:10:44

[of those lists and then the second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m48s)
00:10:48

[of each of those lists and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m51s)
00:10:51

[third one of each of those lists and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m51s)
00:10:51

[like this is a really really common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m53s)
00:10:53

[pattern I need to do something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m55s)
00:10:55

[in basically every notebook I write and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m57s)
00:10:57

[the way to do it is with zip all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h10m59s)
00:10:59

[so zip means look through each of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m02s)
00:11:02

[lists one at a time and then this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m05s)
00:11:05

[is where we can grab that element out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m09s)
00:11:09

[the first list the second list and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m12s)
00:11:12

[third list okay so if you haven't played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m14s)
00:11:14

[around watch with zip that's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m17s)
00:11:17

[important function to practice with like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m19s)
00:11:19

[I say I use it in pretty much every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m22s)
00:11:22

[notebook I write all the time you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m24s)
00:11:24

[to look through you know a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m28s)
00:11:28

[lists at the same time alright so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[going to look through every store every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m36s)
00:11:36

[school holiday at every date yes so is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m38s)
00:11:38

[it living through like all the possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m45s)
00:11:45

[combinations of each of those or for one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m48s)
00:11:48

[one one yeah exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m51s)
00:11:51

[thanks for the question so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m53s)
00:11:53

[we basically want to say let's grab the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m56s)
00:11:56

[first store the first school holiday the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h11m58s)
00:11:58

[first date right so fast or one January](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m02s)
00:12:02

[the first school holiday was true or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m05s)
00:12:05

[false right and so if the if it is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m08s)
00:12:08

[school holiday I'll keep track of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m11s)
00:12:11

[fact by saying the last time I saw a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[school holiday was that day okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m15s)
00:12:15

[then append how long has it been since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m18s)
00:12:18

[the last school holiday right and if the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m22s)
00:12:22

[store ID is different to the last door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m26s)
00:12:26

[ID I saw then I've now got to a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m29s)
00:12:29

[new store in which case I have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[basically reset everything okay you pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m34s)
00:12:34

[that to her what will happen to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m37s)
00:12:37

[first points that we don't have a life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m40s)
00:12:40

[last holiday yeah so I just said I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m43s)
00:12:43

[basically set this to some arbitrary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m47s)
00:12:47

[starting point it's going to end up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m51s)
00:12:51

[like I can't remember is either largest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m52s)
00:12:52

[or the smallest possible date and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h12m55s)
00:12:55

[know you may need to replace this with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m00s)
00:13:00

[missing value afterwards or some you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m03s)
00:13:03

[know the zero or or whatever you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m07s)
00:13:07

[the nice thing is though thanks to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[rallies it's very easy for a neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m17s)
00:13:17

[to kind of cut off extreme values so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[this case I didn't do anything special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m25s)
00:13:25

[with it I ended up with these like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[negative a billion day time stamps and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m27s)
00:13:27

[it still worked fine okay so we can go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m31s)
00:13:31

[through and so the next thing to note is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m36s)
00:13:36

[there's a whole bunch of stuff that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m40s)
00:13:40

[need to do to both the training set and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m42s)
00:13:42

[the test set right so in the previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m44s)
00:13:44

[section I actually kind of added this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m47s)
00:13:47

[little loop where I go for each of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m50s)
00:13:50

[training data frame and the test data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m52s)
00:13:52

[frame through these things right so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m55s)
00:13:55

[kind of you know each cell I did for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h13m58s)
00:13:58

[each of the data frames I've now got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m00s)
00:14:00

[whole coming up a whole series of cells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m03s)
00:14:03

[that I want to run first of all for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m07s)
00:14:07

[training set and then for the test set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m09s)
00:14:09

[so in this case the way I did that was I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m12s)
00:14:12

[have two different cells here one which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m14s)
00:14:14

[set DF to be the training set one which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m16s)
00:14:16

[set to be the test set and so the way I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m19s)
00:14:19

[use this is I run just this cell right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m21s)
00:14:21

[and then I run all the cells underneath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m24s)
00:14:24

[right so it does it alter the training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[set and then I come back and run just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m29s)
00:14:29

[this cell and then run all the cells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m31s)
00:14:31

[underneath okay so like this notebook is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m33s)
00:14:33

[not designed to be just run from top to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m37s)
00:14:37

[bottom but it's designed to be run in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m39s)
00:14:39

[this particular way and I mentioned that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m41s)
00:14:41

[because like this can be a handy trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m44s)
00:14:44

[no like you could of course put all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m47s)
00:14:47

[stuff underneath in a function that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m49s)
00:14:49

[pass the data frame to and call it once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m52s)
00:14:52

[with a test set once with the training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m54s)
00:14:54

[set bill I kind of like to experiment a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[bit more interactively look at each step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h14m59s)
00:14:59

[as I go so this way is an easy way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m01s)
00:15:01

[kind of run something on two different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m04s)
00:15:04

[data frames without turning it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m06s)
00:15:06

[function okay so this is going to if if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[I sort by store and by date then this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m15s)
00:15:15

[keeping track of the last time something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m18s)
00:15:18

[happened and so this is therefore going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m20s)
00:15:20

[to end up telling me how many days was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[it since the last school holiday okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m24s)
00:15:24

[now if I sort date descending and call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m28s)
00:15:28

[the exact same function then it's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m33s)
00:15:33

[to say how long until the next school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m36s)
00:15:36

[holiday okay so that's a kind of a nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m39s)
00:15:39

[little trick for adding these kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m42s)
00:15:42

[event time as arbitrary event timers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[into your time series models right so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m47s)
00:15:47

[you're doing for example the Ecuadorean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m50s)
00:15:50

[groceries competition right now you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m53s)
00:15:53

[maybe this kind of approach would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m55s)
00:15:55

[useful for various events in that as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h15m56s)
00:15:56

[well do it for state holiday do it for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[promo there we go okay the next thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m04s)
00:16:04

[that we look at here is rolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m12s)
00:16:12

[functions so rolling functions is how we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m15s)
00:16:15

[rolling in pandas is how we what we call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m20s)
00:16:20

[create what we call windowing functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m23s)
00:16:23

[so let's say I had some data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[you know something like this right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m40s)
00:16:40

[this is like date and I don't know this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m46s)
00:16:46

[is like sales or whatever what I could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m52s)
00:16:52

[do is I could say like okay let's create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m55s)
00:16:55

[a window around this point of like seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h16m58s)
00:16:58

[days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m03s)
00:17:03

[all right so it'd be like okay this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m03s)
00:17:03

[seven day window say right and so then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[could take the average sales in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m11s)
00:17:11

[seven-day window all right then I could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m15s)
00:17:15

[like do the same thing like I don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m17s)
00:17:17

[over here take the average sales over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m18s)
00:17:18

[that seven-day window all right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m24s)
00:17:24

[if we do that for every point and join](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m26s)
00:17:26

[up those averages you're going to end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m28s)
00:17:28

[with a moving average okay so the kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m31s)
00:17:31

[of the the the more generic version of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m36s)
00:17:36

[the moving average is a window function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m39s)
00:17:39

[ie something where you apply to some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m44s)
00:17:44

[function to some window of data around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m47s)
00:17:47

[each point now very often that windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m50s)
00:17:50

[that I've shown here are not actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m54s)
00:17:54

[what you want if you're trying to build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m56s)
00:17:56

[a predictive model you can't include the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h17m58s)
00:17:58

[future as part of a moving average all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m01s)
00:18:01

[right so quite often you actually need a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m04s)
00:18:04

[window that's ends here so that would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m06s)
00:18:06

[our window function right and so pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m12s)
00:18:12

[lets you create window func arbitrary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m18s)
00:18:18

[window functions using this rolling here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m21s)
00:18:21

[this here says how many time steps do I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m24s)
00:18:24

[want to apply the function to write this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m29s)
00:18:29

[here says if I'm at the edge so in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m32s)
00:18:32

[words if I'm like out here should you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m35s)
00:18:35

[have should you make that a missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m38s)
00:18:38

[value because I don't have seven days to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m41s)
00:18:41

[average over or you know what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m43s)
00:18:43

[minimum number of time periods to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m46s)
00:18:46

[that's so here I said one okay and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m47s)
00:18:47

[then optionally you can also say do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m50s)
00:18:50

[want to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m53s)
00:18:53

[the window at the start of a period or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m54s)
00:18:54

[the end of a period or the middle of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h18m56s)
00:18:56

[period okay so and then within that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m00s)
00:19:00

[can then apply whatever function you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m02s)
00:19:02

[like okay so here I've got my weekly buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m04s)
00:19:04

[store sums okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m09s)
00:19:09

[so there's a nice easy way of getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m12s)
00:19:12

[kind of moving averages or or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m17s)
00:19:17

[else and you know I should mention in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m20s)
00:19:20

[pandas if you go to the time series page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m22s)
00:19:22

[on pandas there's literally like look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m27s)
00:19:27

[just the index here time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m32s)
00:19:32

[functionality is all of this is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[like there's lots because like where's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m39s)
00:19:39

[bikini who created this he was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m41s)
00:19:41

[originally in hedge fund trading I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m43s)
00:19:43

[believe and you know his work was all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m46s)
00:19:46

[about time series and so I think like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m49s)
00:19:49

[pandas originally was very focused on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m52s)
00:19:52

[time series and still you know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m53s)
00:19:53

[perhaps the strongest part of pandas so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m56s)
00:19:56

[if you're playing like if you're playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h19m58s)
00:19:58

[around with time-series computations you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m00s)
00:20:00

[definitely owe it to yourself to try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m02s)
00:20:02

[learn this entire API and like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[there's a lot of kind of conceptual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m09s)
00:20:09

[pieces around like time stamps and date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m11s)
00:20:11

[offsets and resampling and stuff like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m16s)
00:20:16

[that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m19s)
00:20:19

[to kind of get your head around but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[totally worth it because otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m21s)
00:20:21

[you'll be writing this stuff as loops by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m24s)
00:20:24

[hand it's going to take you a lot longer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m27s)
00:20:27

[than leveraging what pandas already does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[and of course pandas will do it in you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m30s)
00:20:30

[know highly optimized C code for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m34s)
00:20:34

[vectorize the C code whereas your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m37s)
00:20:37

[version is going to loop in Python so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m39s)
00:20:39

[definitely worth you know if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m41s)
00:20:41

[doing stuff in x here is learning the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m43s)
00:20:43

[the full panda's time series API there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m45s)
00:20:45

[about is about as strong as any time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m50s)
00:20:50

[series API out there okay so at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m52s)
00:20:52

[of all that you can see here's those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m57s)
00:20:57

[kind of starting point values I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h20m59s)
00:20:59

[mentioned slightly on the extreme side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m01s)
00:21:01

[and so you can see here the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m05s)
00:21:05

[17th of September store one was thirteen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m07s)
00:21:07

[days after the last school holiday the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m12s)
00:21:12

[16th was 12 11 10 so forth okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m15s)
00:21:15

[we're currently in a promotion right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m18s)
00:21:18

[here this is one day before a promotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m21s)
00:21:21

[here we've got nine days after the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m25s)
00:21:25

[promotion and so forth okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m27s)
00:21:27

[how we can add kind of event counters to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m32s)
00:21:32

[our time series and probably always a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m38s)
00:21:38

[good idea when you're doing work with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m40s)
00:21:40

[time series so now that we've done that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m43s)
00:21:43

[you know we've got lots of columns in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m47s)
00:21:47

[our data set and so we split them out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m50s)
00:21:50

[into categorical versus continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m53s)
00:21:53

[columns we'll talk more about that in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m55s)
00:21:55

[moment in the review section but so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h21m59s)
00:21:59

[these are going to be all the things I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m01s)
00:22:01

[going to create an embedding for okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m02s)
00:22:02

[and these are all of the things that I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m04s)
00:22:04

[going to feed directly into the into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m07s)
00:22:07

[model so for example we've got like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m10s)
00:22:10

[competition distance so that's distance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m14s)
00:22:14

[to the nearest competitor maximum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m16s)
00:22:16

[temperature and here we've got day of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m18s)
00:22:18

[week right so so here we've got maximum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m21s)
00:22:21

[temperature maybe is like twenty two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m33s)
00:22:33

[point one because they use centigrade in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m37s)
00:22:37

[Germany we've got distance two nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m39s)
00:22:39

[competitor might be 321 kilometres 0.7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m42s)
00:22:42

[all right and then we've got day of week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m47s)
00:22:47

[which might be I don't know maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m52s)
00:22:52

[Saturday is a six okay so these numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h22m54s)
00:22:54

[here are going to go straight into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m00s)
00:23:00

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m03s)
00:23:03

[now vector right the vector that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m09s)
00:23:09

[going to be feeding into our neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m12s)
00:23:12

[right 22 1-3 21.7 okay well see in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m14s)
00:23:14

[moment we'll actually will normalize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m24s)
00:23:24

[them but more or less but this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m25s)
00:23:25

[categorical variable we're not we need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m29s)
00:23:29

[to put it through an embedding right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m31s)
00:23:31

[we'll have some embedding matrix right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m34s)
00:23:34

[of if there are seven days by I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m37s)
00:23:37

[know maybe dimension for embedding okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m42s)
00:23:42

[and so this will look up the sixth row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m44s)
00:23:44

[to get back the four items right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m47s)
00:23:47

[this is going to turn into length four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m53s)
00:23:53

[vector which will then add here okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h23m59s)
00:23:59

[so that's how our continuous and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m08s)
00:24:08

[categorical variables they're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m10s)
00:24:10

[work so then all of our categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m13s)
00:24:13

[variables will turn them into pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m25s)
00:24:25

[categorical variables in the same way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m27s)
00:24:27

[that we've done before and then we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[going to apply the same mappings to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m34s)
00:24:34

[test set right so if Saturday is a six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m36s)
00:24:36

[in the training set this apply cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m40s)
00:24:40

[makes sure that Saturday is also a six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m42s)
00:24:42

[and the test set for the continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m45s)
00:24:45

[variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m48s)
00:24:48

[make sure they're all floats because pay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m49s)
00:24:49

[torch expects everything to be a float](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[so then this is another little trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h24m57s)
00:24:57

[that I use both of these cells to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m00s)
00:25:00

[something called joined sent one of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m04s)
00:25:04

[defines them as the whole training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m08s)
00:25:08

[one of them defines them as a random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m11s)
00:25:11

[subset all right and so the idea is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m14s)
00:25:14

[I do all of my work on the sample make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m17s)
00:25:17

[sure it all works well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m19s)
00:25:19

[play around with different hyper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[parameters and architectures and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m22s)
00:25:22

[unlike okay I'm very happy with this I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m24s)
00:25:24

[then go back and run this line of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m26s)
00:25:26

[to say okay now make that make the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m29s)
00:25:29

[dataset be the sample and then rerun it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m32s)
00:25:32

[okay so this is a good way again similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m35s)
00:25:35

[to that what I showed you before it lets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m37s)
00:25:37

[you use the same cells in your notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[to run first of all on the sample and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m41s)
00:25:41

[then go back later and run it on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m43s)
00:25:43

[full data set okay so now that we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m46s)
00:25:46

[that join samp we can then pass it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m52s)
00:25:52

[proc DF as we've done before to grab the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m55s)
00:25:55

[dependent variable to deal with missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h25m59s)
00:25:59

[values and in this case we pass one more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m02s)
00:26:02

[thing which is du scale equals true de](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m05s)
00:26:05

[scale equals true we'll subtract the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m09s)
00:26:09

[mean and divide by the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m13s)
00:26:13

[deviation and so the reason for that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m16s)
00:26:16

[that if our first layer you know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m19s)
00:26:19

[just a matrix model play right so here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m23s)
00:26:23

[our set of weights and our input is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m26s)
00:26:26

[I don't know it's got something with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m30s)
00:26:30

[just like 0.001 and then it's got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m32s)
00:26:32

[something like which is like 10 to the 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m35s)
00:26:35

[right and then our weight matrix has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m38s)
00:26:38

[been initialized to be like random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m41s)
00:26:41

[numbers between 0 &amp; 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m44s)
00:26:44

[right so got like 0.6 0.1 etc then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m45s)
00:26:45

[basically this thing here is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m50s)
00:26:50

[have gradients that are nine orders of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m52s)
00:26:52

[magnitude bigger than this thing here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m56s)
00:26:56

[which is not going to be good for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h26m58s)
00:26:58

[optimization okay so by normalizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m00s)
00:27:00

[everything to be mean of 0 standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m04s)
00:27:04

[deviation of 1 to start with then that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m07s)
00:27:07

[means that all of the gradients are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m10s)
00:27:10

[going to be you know on the same kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m12s)
00:27:12

[scale we didn't have to do that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[random forests because in random forests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m20s)
00:27:20

[we only cared about the sort order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m23s)
00:27:23

[we didn't care about the values at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m25s)
00:27:25

[right but in that with linear models and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m28s)
00:27:28

[things that are built out of layers of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m32s)
00:27:32

[lynnium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m34s)
00:27:34

[like ie neural nets we care very much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[about the scale okay so do scale equals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m38s)
00:27:38

[true normalizes our data for us now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m42s)
00:27:42

[since it normalizes our data for us it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m45s)
00:27:45

[returns one extra object which is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m47s)
00:27:47

[mapper which is an object that contains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m51s)
00:27:51

[for each continuous variable what was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m53s)
00:27:53

[the mean and standard deviation it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m56s)
00:27:56

[normalized with the reason being that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h27m58s)
00:27:58

[we're going to have to use the same know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m01s)
00:28:01

[mean and standard deviation on the test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[set correct because we need our test set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m06s)
00:28:06

[in our training set to be scaled in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m09s)
00:28:09

[exact same way otherwise they're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[to have different meanings okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[these details about making sure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m16s)
00:28:16

[your tests and training set have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m20s)
00:28:20

[same categorical codings the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[missing value replacement and the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m25s)
00:28:25

[scaling normalization are really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m27s)
00:28:27

[important to get right because if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m30s)
00:28:30

[don't get it right then your test set is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m33s)
00:28:33

[you know not gonna work at all okay but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m35s)
00:28:35

[if you follow these steps you know it'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m41s)
00:28:41

[work fine we also take the log of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m43s)
00:28:43

[dependent variable and that's because in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m47s)
00:28:47

[this capital competition the evaluation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m49s)
00:28:49

[metric was root mean squared percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m52s)
00:28:52

[error so root mean squared percent error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m54s)
00:28:54

[means we're being penalized based on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h28m57s)
00:28:57

[ratio between our answer and the correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m01s)
00:29:01

[answer we don't have a loss function in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m04s)
00:29:04

[pie chart called root mean square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[percent error we could write 1 but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m10s)
00:29:10

[easier is just to take the log of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m14s)
00:29:14

[dependent because the difference between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m16s)
00:29:16

[logs is the same as the ratio okay so by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m17s)
00:29:17

[taking the log we kind of get that for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m21s)
00:29:21

[free you'll notice like the vast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m23s)
00:29:23

[majority of regression competitions on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m25s)
00:29:25

[Kaggle use either root mean squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[percent error or a root mean squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m32s)
00:29:32

[error of the log as their evaluation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m34s)
00:29:34

[metric and that's because in real world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m36s)
00:29:36

[problems most of the time we care more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m38s)
00:29:38

[about ratios than about raw differences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m41s)
00:29:41

[right so if you're designing your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m44s)
00:29:44

[project it's quite likely that you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m48s)
00:29:48

[want to think about using log of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m51s)
00:29:51

[dependent variable so then we create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h29m55s)
00:29:55

[validation set and as we've learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m01s)
00:30:01

[before most of the time if you've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m03s)
00:30:03

[problem involving a time component your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m07s)
00:30:07

[validation set probably wants to be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[most recent time period rather than a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m12s)
00:30:12

[random subset okay so that's what I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m15s)
00:30:15

[here when I finished modeling and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[found an architecture and a set of hyper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m22s)
00:30:22

[parameters and a number of epochs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[all that stuff that works really well if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m25s)
00:30:25

[I want to make my model as good as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m28s)
00:30:28

[possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m29s)
00:30:29

[I'll retrain on the whole thing right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m30s)
00:30:30

[including the validation set right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m33s)
00:30:33

[currently at least past AI assumes that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m36s)
00:30:36

[you do have a validation set so my kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m39s)
00:30:39

[of hacky workaround is to set my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[validation set to just be one index](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

[which is the first row okay and that way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m46s)
00:30:46

[like all the code keeps working but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m48s)
00:30:48

[there's no real validation set so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m50s)
00:30:50

[obviously if you do this you need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m53s)
00:30:53

[make sure that your final training is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m55s)
00:30:55

[like the exact same hyperparameters the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h30m58s)
00:30:58

[exact same number of epochs exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m00s)
00:31:00

[same as the thing that worked because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m02s)
00:31:02

[you don't actually have a proper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m05s)
00:31:05

[validation set now to check against I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m06s)
00:31:06

[have a question regarding get elapsed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m10s)
00:31:10

[function which we discussed before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m12s)
00:31:12

[so in get elapsed function we are trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m15s)
00:31:15

[to find when is the next holiday like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m18s)
00:31:18

[when will the next one ready come how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m23s)
00:31:23

[many how many days away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m26s)
00:31:26

[so every year the holidays are more or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m27s)
00:31:27

[less fixed like there will be holiday on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m31s)
00:31:31

[4th of July 21st assemble and there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m33s)
00:31:33

[hardly any change so can't we just look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m36s)
00:31:36

[from previous years and just get a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m38s)
00:31:38

[of all the holidays that are going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m41s)
00:31:41

[occur this year maybe I mean in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m42s)
00:31:42

[case I guess like that's not sure of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m47s)
00:31:47

[promo right and some holidays change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m49s)
00:31:49

[like Easter you know so like this this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m53s)
00:31:53

[this way I get to write one piece of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h31m57s)
00:31:57

[code that works for all of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m00s)
00:32:00

[you know and it doesn't take very long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m02s)
00:32:02

[to run so yeah so there might be ways if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m06s)
00:32:06

[you're if your data set was so big that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m09s)
00:32:09

[this took too long you could maybe do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m11s)
00:32:11

[on one year and then kind of somehow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m13s)
00:32:13

[copy it but yeah in this case so those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m14s)
00:32:14

[no need to and I don't you know I always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m17s)
00:32:17

[value my time over my computer's time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m20s)
00:32:20

[I try to keep things as simple as I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m25s)
00:32:25

[okay so now we can create our model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[so to create our model we have to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m34s)
00:32:34

[a model data object as we always do with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m36s)
00:32:36

[fast AI so a columnar model data object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m38s)
00:32:38

[is just a data a model data object that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m41s)
00:32:41

[represents a training set a validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m43s)
00:32:43

[set and an optional test set of standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m45s)
00:32:45

[columnar you know structured data okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m48s)
00:32:48

[and we just have to tell it which of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m51s)
00:32:51

[variables should we treat as categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m55s)
00:32:55

[okay and then pass in our data friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h32m59s)
00:32:59

[so for each of our categorical variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m06s)
00:33:06

[here is the number of categories it has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m10s)
00:33:10

[okay so for each of our embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[matrices this tells us the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m18s)
00:33:18

[rows and that embedding matrix and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m21s)
00:33:21

[then we define what embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m26s)
00:33:26

[dimensionality we want if you're doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m29s)
00:33:29

[like natural language processing then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m35s)
00:33:35

[the number of dimensions you need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m37s)
00:33:37

[capture all the nuance of what a word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[means and how it's used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m41s)
00:33:41

[has been found empirically to be about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m43s)
00:33:43

[600 it turns out that when you do NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m46s)
00:33:46

[models with embedding matrices that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m51s)
00:33:51

[that are smaller than 600 you don't get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m55s)
00:33:55

[as good a results as you do if you do if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h33m59s)
00:33:59

[there's the size 600 beyond 600 it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m01s)
00:34:01

[doesn't seem to improve much I would say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m04s)
00:34:04

[that human language is one of the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m07s)
00:34:07

[complex things that we model so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m09s)
00:34:09

[wouldn't expect you to come across](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m14s)
00:34:14

[many if any categorical variables that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m16s)
00:34:16

[need embedding matrices with more than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m19s)
00:34:19

[600 dimensions at the other end you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m21s)
00:34:21

[some things may have pretty simple kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m28s)
00:34:28

[of causality right so for example let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m32s)
00:34:32

[have a look state holiday you know maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m38s)
00:34:38

[if something's a holiday then it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m44s)
00:34:44

[a case of like ok at stores that are in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m47s)
00:34:47

[the city there's some behavior there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m50s)
00:34:50

[doors that are in the country there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m52s)
00:34:52

[some other behavior and that's about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m54s)
00:34:54

[you know like maybe it's a pretty pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m56s)
00:34:56

[simple relationship so like ideally when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h34m58s)
00:34:58

[you decide what imbedding size to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m04s)
00:35:04

[you would kind of use your knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m08s)
00:35:08

[about the domain to decide like how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m10s)
00:35:10

[complex is the relationship and so how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m14s)
00:35:14

[big embedding do I need right in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m17s)
00:35:17

[practice you almost never know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m19s)
00:35:19

[right like you only know that because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m23s)
00:35:23

[maybe somebody else has previously done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m25s)
00:35:25

[that research and figured it out like in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m27s)
00:35:27

[NLP so in practice you probably need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m29s)
00:35:29

[use some rule of thumb okay and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m34s)
00:35:34

[having tried to a rule of thumb you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m37s)
00:35:37

[could then maybe try a little bit higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m39s)
00:35:39

[and a little bit lower and see what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m41s)
00:35:41

[helps so it's kind of experimental so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[here's my rule of thumb my rule of thumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m45s)
00:35:45

[is look at how how many discrete values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m47s)
00:35:47

[the category has ie the number of rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m52s)
00:35:52

[in the embedding matrix and make the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m55s)
00:35:55

[dimensionality of the embedding half of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m57s)
00:35:57

[that alright so if a day of week which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[is the second one eight rows and four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m03s)
00:36:03

[colors so here it is there right the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m06s)
00:36:06

[number of categories divided by two but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m11s)
00:36:11

[then I say don't go more than 50 right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m15s)
00:36:15

[so here you can see for store there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m17s)
00:36:17

[thousand stores only have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m19s)
00:36:19

[dimensionality of 50 why 50 I don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m20s)
00:36:20

[it seems to work - okay so far like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m23s)
00:36:23

[may find you need something a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m26s)
00:36:26

[different actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m27s)
00:36:27

[for the ecuadorian groceries competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m29s)
00:36:29

[you know I haven't really tried playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[with this but I think we may need some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m34s)
00:36:34

[larger embedding sizes but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m35s)
00:36:35

[something to feel a bit princess can you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m40s)
00:36:40

[pass that left social variables the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m42s)
00:36:42

[cardinality size becomes larger and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m46s)
00:36:46

[larger you're creating more and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m47s)
00:36:47

[like I think we collide in very much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m50s)
00:36:50

[seas on you therefore massively risking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m53s)
00:36:53

[overfitting which is just using so many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m56s)

[parameters of the model can never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h36m58s)

[the difference between modern machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m08s)
00:37:08

[learning and old machine learning an old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m10s)
00:37:10

[machine learning we control complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m13s)
00:37:13

[by reducing the number of parameters in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m16s)
00:37:16

[modern machine learning we control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m17s)
00:37:17

[complexity by regularization so short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m19s)
00:37:19

[answer is not I'm not concerned about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m23s)
00:37:23

[overfitting because the way I avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m25s)
00:37:25

[overfitting is not by reducing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[number of parameters but by increasing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m29s)
00:37:29

[my dropout or increasing my weight okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m31s)
00:37:31

[okay now having said that like there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m35s)
00:37:35

[no point using more parameters for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m39s)
00:37:39

[particular embedding than I need like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m42s)
00:37:42

[because regularization like is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m45s)
00:37:45

[penalizing a model by giving it like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m48s)
00:37:48

[more random data or by actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m51s)
00:37:51

[penalizing weights so we like we'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[rather not use more than we have to but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m55s)
00:37:55

[they're kind of my general rule of thumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h37m59s)
00:37:59

[for designing an architecture is to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m01s)
00:38:01

[know be generous on the side of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m05s)
00:38:05

[number of parameters but yeah in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m07s)
00:38:07

[case if after doing some work we kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m09s)
00:38:09

[felt like you know what the store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m12s)
00:38:12

[doesn't actually seem to be that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m15s)
00:38:15

[important then I might manually go and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m18s)
00:38:18

[make change this to make it smaller but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[you know or if I was really finding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m23s)
00:38:23

[there's not enough data here I'm either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m25s)
00:38:25

[overfitting or I'm using more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m27s)
00:38:27

[regularization uncomfortable with again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m29s)
00:38:29

[you know then you might go back but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m31s)
00:38:31

[would always start with like being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m33s)
00:38:33

[generous with parameters and yeah in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m34s)
00:38:34

[this case this model turned out pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m37s)
00:38:37

[good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m40s)
00:38:40

[okay so now we've got a list of tuples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m41s)
00:38:41

[containing the number of rows and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m43s)
00:38:43

[columns of each bar embedding matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m45s)
00:38:45

[and so when we call get learner to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m47s)
00:38:47

[create our neural net that's the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m50s)
00:38:50

[thing we pass in right is how big is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m52s)
00:38:52

[each of our embeddings okay and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m55s)
00:38:55

[tell it how many continuous variables we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h38m58s)
00:38:58

[have we tell it how many activations to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m01s)
00:39:01

[create for each layer and we tell it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m04s)
00:39:04

[what dropout to use page layer okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m06s)
00:39:06

[so then we can go ahead and call fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m10s)
00:39:10

[okay so then we fit for awhile and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m15s)
00:39:15

[kind of getting something around the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m21s)
00:39:21

[point one mark all right so I tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m23s)
00:39:23

[running this on the test set and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m26s)
00:39:26

[submitted it to kaggle during the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m29s)
00:39:29

[actually last week and here it is okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m32s)
00:39:32

[private score 107 public score 103 okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m39s)
00:39:39

[so let's have a look and see how that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m46s)
00:39:46

[would go so when I was seven private 103](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m48s)
00:39:48

[public's let's start on public which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m50s)
00:39:50

[103 not there out of 3000 I've got to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h39m52s)
00:39:52

[back a long way here it is 103 okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m09s)
00:40:09

[three hundred and fortieth yeah that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m17s)
00:40:17

[not good so on the public leaderboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m20s)
00:40:20

[three hundred and fortieth let's try the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m24s)
00:40:24

[private leader board which is 107 oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m26s)
00:40:26

[fifth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[so like hopefully you are now thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[oh there are some chemical competitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m38s)
00:40:38

[finishing soon which I entered and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m41s)
00:40:41

[spent a lot of time trying to get good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m43s)
00:40:43

[results on the public leaderboard I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m44s)
00:40:44

[wonder if that was a good idea and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[answer is no I want write the cavil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m49s)
00:40:49

[public leaderboard is not meant to be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m52s)
00:40:52

[replacement for your carefully developed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m55s)
00:40:55

[validation set okay so for example if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h40m58s)
00:40:58

[you're doing the iceburg competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m02s)
00:41:02

[right which ones are ships which ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m04s)
00:41:04

[icebergs then they've actually put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m06s)
00:41:06

[something like 4,000 synthetic images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m09s)
00:41:09

[into the public leaderboard and money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m12s)
00:41:12

[into the private leaderboard okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m14s)
00:41:14

[this is one of the really good kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m19s)
00:41:19

[things that tests you out on Kegel is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m23s)
00:41:23

[like are you creating a good validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m26s)
00:41:26

[set and are you trusting it right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m28s)
00:41:28

[because if you're trusting your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m30s)
00:41:30

[leaderboard feedback more than your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m32s)
00:41:32

[validation feedback then you may find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m35s)
00:41:35

[yourself in three hundred and fiftieth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m37s)
00:41:37

[place when you thought you're in fifth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m39s)
00:41:39

[right so in this case we actually had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m41s)
00:41:41

[pretty good validation set right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[as you can see it's saying like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m47s)
00:41:47

[somewhere around 0.1 and we actually did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m48s)
00:41:48

[get somewhere around 0.1 okay and so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[this case the validation set that's re](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m56s)
00:41:56

[that publicly the board in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m57s)
00:41:57

[competition was entirely useless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h41m59s)
00:41:59

[yeah can you place the box please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m02s)
00:42:02

[so in regards to that how much does the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m06s)
00:42:06

[top of the public leaderboard actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m10s)
00:42:10

[correspond to the top of a privately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m12s)
00:42:12

[reward because in the in the churn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m14s)
00:42:14

[prediction challenge there's like for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[people who are just completely above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m19s)
00:42:19

[everyone else that's it it totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m22s)
00:42:22

[depends you know like if they randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m24s)
00:42:24

[sample the public and private](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m28s)
00:42:28

[leaderboard then it should be extremely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m30s)
00:42:30

[indicative right but it might not be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m32s)
00:42:32

[right so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[okay let's crushed oh here comes so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m41s)
00:42:41

[this case the person who was second on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m45s)
00:42:45

[the public leader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m48s)
00:42:48

[what did end up winning s dnt came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h42m49s)
00:42:49

[seventh right so in fact you can see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m00s)
00:43:00

[little green thing here right where else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m04s)
00:43:04

[this guy jumped 96 places if we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m06s)
00:43:06

[entered with the neural net we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m11s)
00:43:11

[looked at we would have jumped 250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m12s)
00:43:12

[places so it yeah it just depends and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m14s)
00:43:14

[often like you can figure out where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m18s)
00:43:18

[the public leaderboard like sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[they'll tell you the public leaderboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[was randomly sampled sometimes they'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m25s)
00:43:25

[tell you it's not generally you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m27s)
00:43:27

[figure it out by looking at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m29s)
00:43:29

[correlation between your validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m31s)
00:43:31

[results and the public leaderboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m33s)
00:43:33

[results to see how well they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m35s)
00:43:35

[correlated sometimes if like 2 or 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m37s)
00:43:37

[people are way ahead of everybody else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m41s)
00:43:41

[they may have found some kind of leakage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m43s)
00:43:43

[or something like that like that's often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[a sign that there's some trick okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m49s)
00:43:49

[that's Russman and that brings us to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h43m57s)
00:43:57

[end of all of our material so let's come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m03s)
00:44:03

[back after the break and do a quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m07s)
00:44:07

[review and then we will talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m09s)
00:44:09

[ethics and machine level so let's come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[back in five minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m15s)
00:44:15

[so we've learnt two ways to train a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m21s)
00:44:21

[model one is by building a tree and one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m26s)
00:44:26

[is with SGD okay and so the SGD approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m32s)
00:44:32

[is a way we can train a model which is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m38s)
00:44:38

[linear model or a stack of linear layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m43s)
00:44:43

[with nonlinearities between them whereas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m47s)
00:44:47

[tree building specifically will give us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m51s)
00:44:51

[a tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m53s)
00:44:53

[okay and then tree building we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[combine with bagging to create a random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[forest or with boosting to create a GBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m00s)
00:45:00

[or various other slight variations such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m04s)
00:45:04

[as extremely randomize trees so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m08s)
00:45:08

[worth like reminding ourselves of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m12s)
00:45:12

[what these things do so let's let's look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m16s)
00:45:16

[at some data so if we've got some data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m23s)
00:45:23

[like so actually let's look specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m36s)
00:45:36

[let's look specifically a categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m41s)
00:45:41

[data right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m43s)
00:45:43

[okay so categorical data there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m47s)
00:45:47

[couple of possibilities of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m51s)
00:45:51

[categorical data might look like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m52s)
00:45:52

[could be like okay so let's say we got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m54s)
00:45:54

[zip code like so we've got line for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m56s)
00:45:56

[double O three here's our zip code right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h45m57s)
00:45:57

[and then we've got like sales right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m00s)
00:46:00

[it's like 50 and like nine four one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m05s)
00:46:05

[three one sales or twenty two and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m09s)
00:46:09

[forth all right so we've got some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m13s)
00:46:13

[categorical variable so there's a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m14s)
00:46:14

[of ways we could represent that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m18s)
00:46:18

[categorical variable one would be just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m21s)
00:46:21

[to use the number right and like maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m24s)
00:46:24

[it wasn't a number to start you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m27s)
00:46:27

[maybe it wasn't a number at all maybe a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m29s)
00:46:29

[categorical variable is like San](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[Francisco New York](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m32s)
00:46:32

[Mumbai and Sydney right but we can turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m35s)
00:46:35

[it into a number just by like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m40s)
00:46:40

[arbitrarily deciding to give them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m42s)
00:46:42

[numbers right so like it ends up in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m44s)
00:46:44

[number so we could just use that kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m47s)
00:46:47

[arbitrary number so if if it turns out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[that zip codes that are numerically next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m53s)
00:46:53

[to each other have somewhat similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m57s)
00:46:57

[behavior then the zip code versus sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h46m59s)
00:46:59

[chart might look something like this for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m06s)
00:47:06

[example right or alternatively if the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m13s)
00:47:13

[zip code versus sales like sorry if the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m19s)
00:47:19

[two zip codes next to each other didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[have any ways similar similar sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m26s)
00:47:26

[behavior you would expect to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m29s)
00:47:29

[something that looked more like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m31s)
00:47:31

[like kind of just all over the place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m34s)
00:47:34

[right okay so there are kind of two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m36s)
00:47:36

[possibilities so what a random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m41s)
00:47:41

[would do if we had just encoded zip in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m46s)
00:47:46

[this way is it's gonna say alright I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m48s)
00:47:48

[need to find my single best split point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m52s)
00:47:52

[okay the split point that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m56s)
00:47:56

[make the two sides have as smaller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h47m57s)
00:47:57

[standard deviation as possible or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m01s)
00:48:01

[mathematically equivalently have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m03s)
00:48:03

[lowest root mean squared error so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[this case it might pick here as our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m08s)
00:48:08

[first bit point because on this side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m14s)
00:48:14

[there's one average and on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m17s)
00:48:17

[side there's the other average okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m19s)
00:48:19

[then for its second split point it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m23s)
00:48:23

[going to say okay how do I split this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m26s)
00:48:26

[and it's probably going to say I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m28s)
00:48:28

[split here right because now we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m31s)
00:48:31

[this average versus this average right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m34s)
00:48:34

[and then finally it's going to say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m39s)
00:48:39

[how do we split here and it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m42s)
00:48:42

[say okay I'll spit there right so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m44s)
00:48:44

[I've got that average and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m47s)
00:48:47

[average okay so you can see that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m48s)
00:48:48

[able to kind of hone in on the set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m51s)
00:48:51

[spits it needs even though it kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m55s)
00:48:55

[doesn't greatly top down one at a time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m56s)
00:48:56

[right the only reason it wouldn't be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h48m58s)
00:48:58

[able to do this as if like it was just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m00s)
00:49:00

[such bad luck that the two halves were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m03s)
00:49:03

[kind of always exactly balanced right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m06s)
00:49:06

[but even if that happens it's not going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m09s)
00:49:09

[to be the end of the world it'll spit on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m10s)
00:49:10

[something else some other variable and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m12s)
00:49:12

[next time around you know it's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m15s)
00:49:15

[unlikely that it's still going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m17s)
00:49:17

[exactly balanced in both parts of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m19s)
00:49:19

[tree all right so in practice this works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m21s)
00:49:21

[just fine in the second case right it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m23s)
00:49:23

[can do exactly the same thing right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m29s)
00:49:29

[it'll say like okay which is my best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m30s)
00:49:30

[first split right even as though there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m33s)
00:49:33

[no relationship between one zip code and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m36s)
00:49:36

[its neighboring zip code numerically we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m39s)
00:49:39

[can still see here if it if it's bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m41s)
00:49:41

[here right there's the average on one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m43s)
00:49:43

[side and the average on the other side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m46s)
00:49:46

[is probably about here okay and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m48s)
00:49:48

[where would it split next probably here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m51s)
00:49:51

[all right because here's the average on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[one side here's the average on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m57s)
00:49:57

[side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m58s)
00:49:58

[all right so again can do the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h49m59s)
00:49:59

[right it's going to need more splits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m01s)
00:50:01

[because it's going to end up having to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[kind of narrow down on each individual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m05s)
00:50:05

[large that code in each individual small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m07s)
00:50:07

[zip code but it's still going to be fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m08s)
00:50:08

[okay so when we're dealing with building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m10s)
00:50:10

[decision trees for random forests or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m16s)
00:50:16

[gbm's or whatever we tend to encode our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m18s)
00:50:18

[variables just as ordinals okay on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[other hand if we are doing a a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m27s)
00:50:27

[network or like a simplest version like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[a linear regression or logistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m33s)
00:50:33

[regression the best it could do is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m36s)
00:50:36

[right which is no good at all and did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m41s)
00:50:41

[over this one it's going to mean like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m45s)
00:50:45

[that okay so an ordinal is not going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m46s)
00:50:46

[be a useful encoding for a linear model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[or something that stacks linear and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m55s)
00:50:55

[nonlinear models together so instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h50m59s)
00:50:59

[what we do is we create a one hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m02s)
00:51:02

[encoding right so we'll say like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m04s)
00:51:04

[know he is zero one zero zero zero here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m07s)
00:51:07

[zero 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m11s)
00:51:11

[he is Oh 100 one okay and so with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m12s)
00:51:12

[encoding that can effectively create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m18s)
00:51:18

[like a little histogram right where it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m21s)
00:51:21

[going to have a different coefficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m24s)
00:51:24

[for each level okay and so that way it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m27s)
00:51:27

[can do exactly what it needs to do can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m29s)
00:51:29

[you pass that back please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m32s)
00:51:32

[at what point does that become like too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m36s)
00:51:36

[tedious for your system or does it not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m39s)
00:51:39

[pretty much never yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m42s)
00:51:42

[because remember in real life we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m47s)
00:51:47

[actually actually we don't actually have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m50s)
00:51:50

[to create that matrix instead we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m51s)
00:51:51

[just you know have the four coefficients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m55s)
00:51:55

[right and just do an index lookup to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h51m58s)
00:51:58

[grab the second one which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m01s)
00:52:01

[mathematically equivalent to x on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m02s)
00:52:02

[one pot encoding okay so so that's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m05s)
00:52:05

[problem one thing to mention you know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m08s)
00:52:08

[know you guys have kind of been taught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m16s)
00:52:16

[quite a bit of more like analytical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m20s)
00:52:20

[solutions to things and in analytical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m22s)
00:52:22

[solutions to like a linear regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m25s)
00:52:25

[you get you can't solve something with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m28s)
00:52:28

[this amount of collinearity in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m35s)
00:52:35

[words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m38s)
00:52:38

[Sydnee something you know something is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m39s)
00:52:39

[certainly if it's not Mumbai or New York](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m42s)
00:52:42

[or San Francisco so in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m44s)
00:52:44

[there's a hundred percent collinearity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m46s)
00:52:46

[between the forth of these classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m48s)
00:52:48

[versus the other three and so if you try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m50s)
00:52:50

[to solve a linear aggression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m53s)
00:52:53

[analytically that way the whole thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m53s)
00:52:53

[falls apart now note with SGD we have no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m56s)
00:52:56

[such problem okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h52m59s)
00:52:59

[like SGD why would it care right we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m01s)
00:53:01

[just taking one step along the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m03s)
00:53:03

[derivative here cares a little right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m04s)
00:53:04

[because like in the end the main problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m08s)
00:53:08

[with collinearity is that there's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m10s)
00:53:10

[infinite number of equally good solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m13s)
00:53:13

[right so in other words we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m16s)
00:53:16

[increase all of these and decrease this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m19s)
00:53:19

[or decrease all of these and increase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m21s)
00:53:21

[this and they're going to balance out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m24s)
00:53:24

[right and when there's an infinitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m26s)
00:53:26

[large number of good solutions it means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m29s)
00:53:29

[there's a lot of kind of flat spots in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m32s)
00:53:32

[the Loess surface and it can be harder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m35s)
00:53:35

[to optimize all right so that's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m37s)
00:53:37

[easy way to get rid of all of those flat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m39s)
00:53:39

[spots which is to add a little bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m40s)
00:53:40

[regularization so if we added a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m42s)
00:53:42

[bit of a little bit of weight decay like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m44s)
00:53:44

[one enix seven even then that basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m46s)
00:53:46

[says these are not all equally good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m49s)
00:53:49

[anymore the one which is the best is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m51s)
00:53:51

[one where the parameters are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m53s)
00:53:53

[smallest and the most similar to each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m55s)
00:53:55

[other and so that'll again move it back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h53m58s)
00:53:58

[to being a nice loss function yes could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m00s)
00:54:00

[you just clarify that point you made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m03s)
00:54:03

[about why what hard coding wouldn't be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m07s)
00:54:07

[that sure if we have a one hot encoded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m09s)
00:54:09

[vector right and we are multiplying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m15s)
00:54:15

[by a set of coefficients right then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m21s)
00:54:21

[that's exactly the same thing as simply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m27s)
00:54:27

[saying let's grab the thing where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m29s)
00:54:29

[one is right so in other words if we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m31s)
00:54:31

[stored this as a zero you know and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m34s)
00:54:34

[one has a one and this one is a two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m37s)
00:54:37

[right then it's exactly the same as just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m40s)
00:54:40

[saying hey look up that thing in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m43s)
00:54:43

[array okay and so we call that version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m44s)
00:54:44

[and imbedding right so an embedding is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m48s)
00:54:48

[model clica is a weight matrix you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m52s)
00:54:52

[multiply by a one-pot encoding and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m54s)
00:54:54

[just a computational shortcut okay but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h54m56s)
00:54:56

[it's mathematically the same so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m00s)
00:55:00

[a key difference so the first you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m04s)
00:55:04

[key difference between like solving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m07s)
00:55:07

[linear type models analytically versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m10s)
00:55:10

[with SGD with SGD we don't have to worry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m13s)
00:55:13

[about : the arity and stuff or at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m15s)
00:55:15

[not nearly to the same degree and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m18s)
00:55:18

[the difference between solving a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m21s)
00:55:21

[or single layer or multi-layer model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m24s)
00:55:24

[with SGD versus a trinny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m27s)
00:55:27

[a tree is going to be like it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m29s)
00:55:29

[complain about less things right so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m32s)
00:55:32

[particular you can just use ordinals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m34s)
00:55:34

[as your categorical variables and as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m36s)
00:55:36

[learnt just before we also don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m39s)
00:55:39

[worry about normalizing continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m42s)
00:55:42

[variables for a tree but we do have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m45s)
00:55:45

[worry about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m48s)
00:55:48

[for these SGD change models so then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m48s)
00:55:48

[also learnt a lot about interpreting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m54s)
00:55:54

[random forests in particular and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h55m57s)
00:55:57

[you're interested you may be interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m00s)
00:56:00

[in trying to use those same techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m03s)
00:56:03

[to interpret neural nets right so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m05s)
00:56:05

[want to know which of my features are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m12s)
00:56:12

[important in a neural net you could try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m13s)
00:56:13

[the same thing try shuffling each column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m15s)
00:56:15

[in turn and see how much it changes your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m18s)
00:56:18

[accuracy okay and that's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m21s)
00:56:21

[your feature importance for your neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m23s)
00:56:23

[net and then if you really want to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m25s)
00:56:25

[fun recognize then that shuffling that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m27s)
00:56:27

[column is just a way of calculating how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m31s)
00:56:31

[sensitive the output is to that input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m34s)
00:56:34

[which in other words is the derivative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m36s)
00:56:36

[of the output with respect to that input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m39s)
00:56:39

[and so therefore maybe you could just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m42s)
00:56:42

[ask pipe torch to give you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m45s)
00:56:45

[derivatives with respect to the input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m46s)
00:56:46

[directly and see if that gives you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m48s)
00:56:48

[same kind of answers okay you could do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m50s)
00:56:50

[the same kind of thing for partial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m55s)
00:56:55

[dependence plot you could try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m57s)
00:56:57

[you know doing the exact same thing with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h56m58s)
00:56:58

[your neural net replace everything in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m00s)
00:57:00

[the column with the same value do it for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m02s)
00:57:02

[1960 1961 1962 plot that that I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m05s)
00:57:05

[know if anybody who's done these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m09s)
00:57:09

[before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m11s)
00:57:11

[not because it's rocket science but just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m12s)
00:57:12

[because I don't know maybe no one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m13s)
00:57:13

[thought of it or it's not in our library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m15s)
00:57:15

[I don't know but if somebody tried it I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[think you should find it useful it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m21s)
00:57:21

[make a great blog post maybe even the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m22s)
00:57:22

[paper if you wanted to take it a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m24s)
00:57:24

[further so there's a thought that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m26s)
00:57:26

[something you can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m28s)
00:57:28

[so those most of those interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m29s)
00:57:29

[techniques are not particularly specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m30s)
00:57:30

[to random forests things like the tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m32s)
00:57:32

[interpreter certainly are because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m35s)
00:57:35

[they're all about like what's inside the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m37s)
00:57:37

[tree can you pass it occur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m38s)
00:57:38

[we're applying for interpreter for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m42s)
00:57:42

[neuron that's how are we going to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m45s)
00:57:45

[inference out of activations that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m47s)
00:57:47

[path follows for example so how are we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[going to like in three interpreter we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m53s)
00:57:53

[are like when looking at we are looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m55s)
00:57:55

[at the parts and their contributions of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h57m58s)
00:57:58

[the features in this case it will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m01s)
00:58:01

[same with activations I guess the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m03s)
00:58:03

[contributions of each activation on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m05s)
00:58:05

[their path yeah baby no I haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m07s)
00:58:07

[thought about it how can we like make in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m09s)
00:58:09

[front of the activations so I'd be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m11s)
00:58:11

[careful to say the word inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m15s)
00:58:15

[because no people normally is the word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m16s)
00:58:16

[inference specifically domain the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m17s)
00:58:17

[is like a test a test time okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m19s)
00:58:19

[prediction you make like make some kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m21s)
00:58:21

[of interrogate the model yes yeah I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m23s)
00:58:23

[not sure we should think about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m26s)
00:58:26

[actually Hinton and one of his students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m27s)
00:58:27

[just published a paper on how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m29s)
00:58:29

[approximate a neural net with a tree for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m31s)
00:58:31

[this exact reason which I haven't read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m35s)
00:58:35

[the paper yet could you pass that so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m37s)
00:58:37

[linear regression and traditional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m44s)
00:58:44

[statistics like one of the things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m46s)
00:58:46

[we focused on was statistical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[significance of like the changes and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m50s)
00:58:50

[things like that and so when thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m52s)
00:58:52

[about a tree interpreter or even like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m54s)
00:58:54

[the waterfall chart which I guess is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m56s)
00:58:56

[just a visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m58s)
00:58:58

[um I guess where does that fit in like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h58m59s)
00:58:59

[because we can see like oh now this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m02s)
00:59:02

[looks important in the sense that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[causes large changes but how do we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m06s)
00:59:06

[that it's like traditionally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m08s)
00:59:08

[statistically significant or anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m10s)
00:59:10

[about yeah so most of the time I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m11s)
00:59:11

[care about the traditional statistical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m15s)
00:59:15

[significance and the reason why is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m17s)
00:59:17

[nowadays the main driver of statistical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m20s)
00:59:20

[significance is data volume not kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m22s)
00:59:22

[practical importance and nowadays most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m27s)
00:59:27

[of the models you build will have so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m30s)
00:59:30

[much data that like every tiny thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m31s)
00:59:31

[will be statistically significant but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m34s)
00:59:34

[most of them won't be practically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m37s)
00:59:37

[significant so my main focus therefore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m38s)
00:59:38

[is practical significance which is does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m41s)
00:59:41

[the size of this influence impact your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m44s)
00:59:44

[business you know statistical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m47s)
00:59:47

[significance only you know like it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m50s)
00:59:50

[much more important when we had a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m53s)
00:59:53

[less data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m54s)
00:59:54

[to work with if you do need to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m56s)
00:59:56

[statistical significance because for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=00h59m58s)
00:59:58

[example you have a very small data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m00s)
01:00:00

[because it's like really expensive to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m02s)
01:00:02

[label or hard to collect or whatever or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m03s)
01:00:03

[it's a medical data set for a rare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[disease you can always get statistical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m07s)
01:00:07

[significance by bootstrapping which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m10s)
01:00:10

[to say that you can randomly resample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m13s)
01:00:13

[your data set a number of times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m16s)
01:00:16

[train your model a number of times and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m19s)
01:00:19

[you can then see the actual variation in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m21s)
01:00:21

[predictions ok so that's that's with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m24s)
01:00:24

[bootstrapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[you can turn any model into something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m27s)
01:00:27

[that gives you confidence intervals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m30s)
01:00:30

[there's a paper by Michael Jordan which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m31s)
01:00:31

[has a technique called the bag of little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m34s)
01:00:34

[bootstraps which actually kind of takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m36s)
01:00:36

[takes this a little bit further and well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m39s)
01:00:39

[worth reading if you're interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m41s)
01:00:41

[actually positive prints so you say we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m42s)
01:00:42

[don't need one hold encoding matrix in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m47s)
01:00:47

[if you're doing random forests or if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m50s)
01:00:50

[are doing any cleavage models what will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m53s)
01:00:53

[happen if we do that and how bad can a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m56s)
01:00:56

[model be if you trigger a one horn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h00m58s)
01:00:58

[coding yeah we actually did do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m00s)
01:01:00

[remember we had that like maximum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m03s)
01:01:03

[category size and we did create one-hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m05s)
01:01:05

[encodings and the reason why we did it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m07s)
01:01:07

[was that then our feature importance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m10s)
01:01:10

[would tell us the importance of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m13s)
01:01:13

[individual levels and our partial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m15s)
01:01:15

[dependence plot we could include the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m17s)
01:01:17

[individual levels so it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m18s)
01:01:18

[necessarily make the model worse it may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m23s)
01:01:23

[make it better but it probably won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m26s)
01:01:26

[change it much at all in this case it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m28s)
01:01:28

[hardly changed it this is something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m29s)
01:01:29

[we have noticed on real data also that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m31s)
01:01:31

[if cardinality is higher let's say 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m34s)
01:01:34

[levels and if you do one hot encoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m37s)
01:01:37

[the random forest performs very badly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m40s)
01:01:40

[yeah yeah that's right if the cab now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m42s)
01:01:42

[that's why we have that in that's why in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m43s)
01:01:43

[fast I we have that like maximum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m45s)
01:01:45

[categorical size you know because at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m47s)
01:01:47

[some point you're one hot encoded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m50s)
01:01:50

[variables become too sparse right so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m53s)
01:01:53

[generally like cut it off at six or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m55s)
01:01:55

[seven also because like when you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h01m57s)
01:01:57

[past that it kind of becomes less useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m00s)
01:02:00

[because the feature importance there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m02s)
01:02:02

[going to be too many levels to really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m04s)
01:02:04

[look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m05s)
01:02:05

[so can it not just not look at those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m10s)
01:02:10

[levels which are not important and just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m14s)
01:02:14

[gives those significant features as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m16s)
01:02:16

[important yeah yeah I mean it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m19s)
01:02:19

[it's it'll be okay you know it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m21s)
01:02:21

[like once the cardinality increases to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m24s)
01:02:24

[high you're just you're just splitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m28s)
01:02:28

[your data up you know too much basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m29s)
01:02:29

[and so in practice your ordinal version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m33s)
01:02:33

[is likely to be it's likely to be better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m37s)
01:02:37

[okay so yeah so little there's no time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m41s)
01:02:41

[to you're kind of review everything but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m47s)
01:02:47

[I think that's the kind of key concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m48s)
01:02:48

[and then of course remembering that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m50s)
01:02:50

[know the embedding matrix that we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m52s)
01:02:52

[use is likely to have more than just one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m54s)
01:02:54

[coefficient will actually have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m55s)
01:02:55

[dimensionality of a few coefficients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[which isn't going to be useful for most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h02m59s)
01:02:59

[linear models but once you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[multi-layer models that's now creating a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m04s)
01:03:04

[representation of your category which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m06s)
01:03:06

[kind of quite a lot richer and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[do a lot more with it let's now talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m10s)
01:03:10

[about the most important bit we started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m14s)
01:03:14

[off early in this course talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m18s)
01:03:18

[how actually a lot of machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m23s)
01:03:23

[is kind of misplaced people focus on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m26s)
01:03:26

[predictive accuracy like Amazon has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m29s)
01:03:29

[collaborative filtering algorithm for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m33s)
01:03:33

[recommending books and they end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m35s)
01:03:35

[recommending the book which it thinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m37s)
01:03:37

[you're most likely to write highly and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m39s)
01:03:39

[so what they end up doing is probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m41s)
01:03:41

[recommending a book that you already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m44s)
01:03:44

[have or that you already know about and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[would have bought anyway right which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m48s)
01:03:48

[isn't very valuable what they should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m50s)
01:03:50

[instead have done is to figure out like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[which book can I recommend that would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m54s)
01:03:54

[cause you to change your behavior right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m57s)
01:03:57

[and so that way we actually maximize our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h03m59s)
01:03:59

[lift in sales due to recommendations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m02s)
01:04:02

[so this idea of like the difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m05s)
01:04:05

[between optimizing influencing your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m08s)
01:04:08

[actions were suggest of improving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m12s)
01:04:12

[predictive accuracy improving predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m15s)
01:04:15

[accuracy is a really important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m18s)
01:04:18

[distinction which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m20s)
01:04:20

[like very rarely discussed in academia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m21s)
01:04:21

[or industry kind of crazy enough it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m25s)
01:04:25

[more discussed in industry it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[particularly ignored in most of academia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m30s)
01:04:30

[right so it's a really important idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m32s)
01:04:32

[which is that in the end that our idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m36s)
01:04:36

[the goal of your model presumably is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m39s)
01:04:39

[influence behavior okay and so and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m42s)
01:04:42

[remember I actually mentioned a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m45s)
01:04:45

[paper right have about this where I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m46s)
01:04:46

[introduced this thing called the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m48s)
01:04:48

[drivetrain approach where I talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m49s)
01:04:49

[like ways to think about how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m51s)
01:04:51

[incorporate machine learning into like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m53s)
01:04:53

[how do we actually influence behavior so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h04m57s)
01:04:57

[you know that's a starting point but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m01s)
01:05:01

[then the next question is like okay if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m02s)
01:05:02

[we're trying to influence behavior what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m04s)
01:05:04

[kind of behavior should we be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m08s)
01:05:08

[influencing and how and what might it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m09s)
01:05:09

[mean when we start influencing behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m13s)
01:05:13

[okay because like nowadays like a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m15s)
01:05:15

[the companies that you're going to end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m20s)
01:05:20

[up working at are bigger as companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m21s)
01:05:21

[and you'll be building stuff that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m24s)
01:05:24

[influence millions of people right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m27s)
01:05:27

[what does that mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[so I'm actually I'm not going to tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m32s)
01:05:32

[you what it means because like I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m36s)
01:05:36

[know all I'm going to try and do is make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m38s)
01:05:38

[you aware of some of the issues right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m40s)
01:05:40

[and and make you believe two things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m43s)
01:05:43

[about them first that you should care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m45s)
01:05:45

[right and second that they're big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m48s)
01:05:48

[current issues right the main reason I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m52s)
01:05:52

[want you to care is because I want you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m55s)
01:05:55

[to want to be a good person and show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h05m57s)
01:05:57

[that like not thinking about these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m00s)
01:06:00

[things will make you a bad person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m02s)
01:06:02

[but if you don't find that convincing I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m04s)
01:06:04

[will tell you this Volkswagen were found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m07s)
01:06:07

[to be cheating on their emissions tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m11s)
01:06:11

[the person who was sent to jail for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m15s)
01:06:15

[was the programmer that implemented that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m18s)
01:06:18

[piece of code they did exactly what they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m20s)
01:06:20

[were told to do right and so if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m23s)
01:06:23

[coming in here thinking hey I'm just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m26s)
01:06:26

[techie you know I'll just do what I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m28s)
01:06:28

[told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m30s)
01:06:30

[right that's that's my job is to do what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m30s)
01:06:30

[I'm told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m33s)
01:06:33

[I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[if you do that you can be sent to jail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[for doing what you're told okay so so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[don't just do what you're told because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m40s)
01:06:40

[you can be a bad person and B you can go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m42s)
01:06:42

[to jail okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[second thing to realize is in the heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m48s)
01:06:48

[of the moment you're in a meeting with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m52s)
01:06:52

[twenty people at work and you're all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m54s)
01:06:54

[talking about how you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m56s)
01:06:56

[implement you know this new feature and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m57s)
01:06:57

[everybody's discussing it and there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h06m59s)
01:06:59

[some cut you know and everybody's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m01s)
01:07:01

[we could do this and here's a way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m02s)
01:07:02

[modeling it and then we can implement it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m04s)
01:07:04

[and here's these constraints and there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m05s)
01:07:05

[some part of you that's thinking I'm not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m06s)
01:07:06

[sure we should be doing this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[that's not the right time to be thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m11s)
01:07:11

[about that because it's really hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m13s)
01:07:13

[so like step up there and say excuse me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m15s)
01:07:15

[I'm not sure this is a good idea you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m19s)
01:07:19

[actually need to think about how you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m22s)
01:07:22

[would handle that situation ahead of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m23s)
01:07:23

[time okay so I want you to like think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m25s)
01:07:25

[about about these issues now right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m28s)
01:07:28

[realize that by the time you're in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[middle of it right you might not even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m34s)
01:07:34

[realize it's happening you know like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m38s)
01:07:38

[they'll just it'll just be a meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m40s)
01:07:40

[like every other meeting and a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[people will be talking about how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m43s)
01:07:43

[solve this technical question okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m44s)
01:07:44

[you need to be able to recognize like oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m46s)
01:07:46

[this is actually something with ethical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[implications so Rachel actually wrote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m51s)
01:07:51

[all of these slides I'm sorry she can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m55s)
01:07:55

[be here to present this because like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m57s)
01:07:57

[she's studied this in depth and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[she's actually being in in in difficult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m02s)
01:08:02

[environments herself where she's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m05s)
01:08:05

[seen these things happening you know and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m07s)
01:08:07

[we know how hard it is right but let me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m11s)
01:08:11

[give you a sense of like what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m15s)
01:08:15

[right so so engineers trying to solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m16s)
01:08:16

[engineering problems is you know and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m21s)
01:08:21

[causing problems is not a new thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m23s)
01:08:23

[right so in Nazi Germany IBM that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[group known as Hollerith right Hollerith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m34s)
01:08:34

[was the original name of IBM and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m36s)
01:08:36

[comes from the guy who actually invented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m38s)
01:08:38

[the use of punch cards for tracking the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m40s)
01:08:40

[US Census the first mass wide-scale use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m42s)
01:08:42

[of punch cards for data collection in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m46s)
01:08:46

[the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m48s)
01:08:48

[right and that turned into IBM and so at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m48s)
01:08:48

[this point if this this unit at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m51s)
01:08:51

[was still called Hollerith so Hollerith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m52s)
01:08:52

[sold a punch card system to Nazi Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h08m55s)
01:08:55

[and so each punch card would like code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h09m00s)
01:09:00

[right now Facebook did not set out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h10m50s)
01:10:50

[enable the genocide of their hinga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h10m54s)
01:10:54

[people in Myanmar no instead what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h10m56s)
01:10:56

[happened is they wanted to maximize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h10m59s)
01:10:59

[impression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m01s)
01:11:01

[in place right and so it turns out that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m02s)
01:11:02

[for the data scientists at Facebook's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m04s)
01:11:04

[their algorithms kind of learned that if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m06s)
01:11:06

[you take the kinds of stuff people are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m09s)
01:11:09

[interested in and think them slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m11s)
01:11:11

[more extreme versions of that you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m13s)
01:11:13

[actually going to get a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m15s)
01:11:15

[impressions and the project managers are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m17s)
01:11:17

[saying maximize these impressions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[people are clicking and like it creates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m21s)
01:11:21

[this this thing right and so the the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m23s)
01:11:23

[potential implications are extraordinary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m30s)
01:11:30

[and global right and this is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m32s)
01:11:32

[that like is literally happening you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m35s)
01:11:35

[know this is October 2017 is it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m37s)
01:11:37

[happening now okay could you pass that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m40s)
01:11:40

[back there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[so I just want to clarify what was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m47s)
01:11:47

[happening here so it was the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m50s)
01:11:50

[facilitation it's like fake news or like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m51s)
01:11:51

[inaccurate media yeah so what happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m54s)
01:11:54

[was let me go into it in more detail so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h11m57s)
01:11:57

[what happened was in mid-2016 Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m00s)
01:12:00

[fired its human editors right so it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[humans that decided how to order things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m08s)
01:12:08

[on your homepage those people got fired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m11s)
01:12:11

[and replaced with machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m13s)
01:12:13

[algorithms and so the machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m15s)
01:12:15

[algorithms written by data scientists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m17s)
01:12:17

[like you you know they had nice clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m20s)
01:12:20

[metrics and they were trying to maximize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m25s)
01:12:25

[their predictive accuracy and be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m27s)
01:12:27

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[we think if we put this thing higher up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[than this thing will get more place okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m31s)
01:12:31

[and so it turned out that these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m34s)
01:12:34

[algorithms for putting things on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m37s)
01:12:37

[facebook newsfeed had a tendency to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m39s)
01:12:39

[like Oh human nature is that we tend to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m42s)
01:12:42

[click on things which like stimulate our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m44s)
01:12:44

[views and are therefore like more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m48s)
01:12:48

[extreme versions of things we already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m50s)
01:12:50

[see okay so so this is great for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m51s)
01:12:51

[kind of Facebook revenue model of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m56s)
01:12:56

[maximizing engagement it looked good on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h12m57s)
01:12:57

[all of their KPIs and so at the time you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m00s)
01:13:00

[know there was some negative press about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m04s)
01:13:04

[like you know I'm not sure that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[staff that Facebook's now putting on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m09s)
01:13:09

[their trending section is actually that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m11s)
01:13:11

[accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m14s)
01:13:14

[that from the point of view of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m15s)
01:13:15

[metrics that people are optimizing at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m17s)
01:13:17

[Facebook it looked terrific and so way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m18s)
01:13:18

[back to October 2016 people started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m23s)
01:13:23

[noticing some serious problems for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m27s)
01:13:27

[example it is illegal to target housing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m29s)
01:13:29

[to people of certain races in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m33s)
01:13:33

[that is illegal and yet a news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m36s)
01:13:36

[organization discovered that Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m39s)
01:13:39

[was doing exactly that right in October](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m41s)
01:13:41

[2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m44s)
01:13:44

[ok not because somebody in that data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m45s)
01:13:45

[science team said like let's make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[black people can't live in nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m49s)
01:13:49

[neighborhoods right but instead you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m51s)
01:13:51

[they found that their automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m54s)
01:13:54

[clustering and segmentation algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m57s)
01:13:57

[found there was a cluster of people who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h13m59s)
01:13:59

[didn't like african-americans and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[if you targeted them with these kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m05s)
01:14:05

[ads then they would be more likely to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m07s)
01:14:07

[select this kind of housing or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m10s)
01:14:10

[right but the interesting thing is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m12s)
01:14:12

[even after being told about this three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m14s)
01:14:14

[times Facebook still hasn't fixed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m16s)
01:14:16

[right and that is to say these are not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m19s)
01:14:19

[just technical issues they're also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m21s)
01:14:21

[economic issues right when you start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m23s)
01:14:23

[saying like the thing that you get paid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m25s)
01:14:25

[for that is ads you have to change the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m27s)
01:14:27

[way that you structure those so that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m30s)
01:14:30

[know you either use more people that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m33s)
01:14:33

[cost money or you like a less aggressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m36s)
01:14:36

[on your algorithms to target people you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m38s)
01:14:38

[know based on like minority group status](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m41s)
01:14:41

[or whatever you know that can impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m44s)
01:14:44

[revenues and so the reason I mention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m47s)
01:14:47

[this is you will at likely at some point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m49s)
01:14:49

[in your career find yourself in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m52s)
01:14:52

[conversation where you're thinking I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m54s)
01:14:54

[not confident that this is like morally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m57s)
01:14:57

[ok the person you're talking to is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h14m59s)
01:14:59

[thinking in their head this is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m02s)
01:15:02

[make us a lot of money that and you just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m03s)
01:15:03

[you don't quite ever manage to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m06s)
01:15:06

[successful conversation because you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m09s)
01:15:09

[talking about difficult different things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[you know and so when you're talking to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m12s)
01:15:12

[somebody who may be more experienced and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m15s)
01:15:15

[more senior than you and they may sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m17s)
01:15:17

[like they know what they're talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m18s)
01:15:18

[about right just realized that their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m19s)
01:15:19

[incentives are not necessarily going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m22s)
01:15:22

[be focused on like how do I be a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m25s)
01:15:25

[person you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m28s)
01:15:28

[like they're not thinking how it might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m29s)
01:15:29

[be a bad person but you know the more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m30s)
01:15:30

[time you spend an industry in my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m32s)
01:15:32

[experience the more desensitized you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m34s)
01:15:34

[kind of get to this stuff of like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m36s)
01:15:36

[maybe getting promotions and making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m39s)
01:15:39

[money isn't the most important thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m42s)
01:15:42

[right so for example I've got a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m43s)
01:15:43

[friends who are very good at computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m47s)
01:15:47

[vision and some of them have gone on to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m49s)
01:15:49

[create startups that seem like they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m51s)
01:15:51

[almost handmade to help authoritarian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[governments surveil their you know their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h15m57s)
01:15:57

[citizens and when I ask my friends like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m00s)
01:16:00

[have you thought about how this could be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m03s)
01:16:03

[used in that way you know they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m06s)
01:16:06

[generally kind of offended that I asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m09s)
01:16:09

[you know but but I'm asking you to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m11s)
01:16:11

[about this like you know wherever you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m16s)
01:16:16

[end up working if you end up creating a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m17s)
01:16:17

[start-up like tools can be used for good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m19s)
01:16:19

[or for evil right and so I'm not saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m23s)
01:16:23

[like don't create excellent object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m26s)
01:16:26

[tracking and detection tools from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[computer vision because yeah you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m31s)
01:16:31

[go on and use that to create like a much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m33s)
01:16:33

[better surgical intervention robot tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m37s)
01:16:37

[kit right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m41s)
01:16:41

[I've just seen like be aware of it think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m42s)
01:16:42

[about it talk about it you know so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m45s)
01:16:45

[here's what I'd find like fascinating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m50s)
01:16:50

[and there's this really cool thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m52s)
01:16:52

[actually that made up calm did this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m54s)
01:16:54

[from a made-up contour kits online they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[they think about this they actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h16m58s)
01:16:58

[thought about this they actually thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m00s)
01:17:00

[you know what if we built a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m02s)
01:17:02

[collaborative filtering system like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m04s)
01:17:04

[learned about in class to help people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m06s)
01:17:06

[decide what meetup to go to it might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m10s)
01:17:10

[notice that on the whole in San](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m13s)
01:17:13

[Francisco a few more men and women tend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m14s)
01:17:14

[to go to techie meetups and so it might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[then start to decide to recommend techie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m22s)
01:17:22

[meetups to more men than women as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m26s)
01:17:26

[result of which more men will go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m28s)
01:17:28

[techie meet us as a result of which when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m30s)
01:17:30

[women go to techie meet ups they'll be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m33s)
01:17:33

[like oh this is all men I don't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[want to go to tech he made ups as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m36s)
01:17:36

[result of which the algorithm will get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[new data saying that men like taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m40s)
01:17:40

[meetups that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m42s)
01:17:42

[right and so it continues Matt and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m43s)
01:17:43

[like a little a little bit of kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m46s)
01:17:46

[that initial push from the algorithm can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m50s)
01:17:50

[create this runaway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m52s)
01:17:52

[feedback loop and you end up with like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m53s)
01:17:53

[almost all my old tech meetups for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[instance right and so this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h17m59s)
01:17:59

[feedback loop is a kind of subtle issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m02s)
01:18:02

[that you really want to think about when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m05s)
01:18:05

[you're thinking about like what is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m07s)
01:18:07

[behavior that I'm changing with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m09s)
01:18:09

[algorithm that I'm building so another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m12s)
01:18:12

[example which is kind of terrifying is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m18s)
01:18:18

[in this paper where the authors describe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m22s)
01:18:22

[how a lot of the partment s-- in the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m27s)
01:18:27

[are now using predictive policing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m31s)
01:18:31

[algorithms right so where can we go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m33s)
01:18:33

[find somebody who's about to commit a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m36s)
01:18:36

[crime and so you know that the algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m38s)
01:18:38

[simply feeds back to you basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m44s)
01:18:44

[data that you've given it right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m46s)
01:18:46

[so if your Police Department has engaged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m48s)
01:18:48

[in racial profiling at all in the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m52s)
01:18:52

[then it might suggest slightly more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m56s)
01:18:56

[often maybe you should go to the black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h18m58s)
01:18:58

[neighborhoods to check for people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m00s)
01:19:00

[committing crimes right as a result of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m02s)
01:19:02

[which more of your police officers go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m04s)
01:19:04

[the black neighborhoods as a result of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m06s)
01:19:06

[which they arrest more black people as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m07s)
01:19:07

[result of which the data says that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m10s)
01:19:10

[black neighborhoods are less safe as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m12s)
01:19:12

[result of which the algorithm says to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m14s)
01:19:14

[policeman maybe you should go to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m15s)
01:19:15

[black neighborhoods more often and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m17s)
01:19:17

[forth right and this is not like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m19s)
01:19:19

[know vague possibilities of something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m24s)
01:19:24

[that might happen in the future this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m28s)
01:19:28

[like documented work from top academics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m29s)
01:19:29

[who have carefully studied the data and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m33s)
01:19:33

[the theory right this is like serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m35s)
01:19:35

[scholarly work is like no this is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m38s)
01:19:38

[is happening right now and so you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m40s)
01:19:40

[again like I'm sure all the people that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m43s)
01:19:43

[started creating this predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m46s)
01:19:46

[policing algorithm didn't think like how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m48s)
01:19:48

[do we arrest more black people right you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m51s)
01:19:51

[know hopefully they were actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m53s)
01:19:53

[thinking gosh I'd like my children to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m54s)
01:19:54

[safer on the street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m56s)
01:19:56

[it's how do I create you know a safer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h19m56s)
01:19:56

[society right but they didn't think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[about this this nasty runaway feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m03s)
01:20:03

[loop so actually this this one about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m07s)
01:20:07

[social network algorithms is actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m10s)
01:20:10

[article in The New York Times recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m12s)
01:20:12

[that one of my friends Renee direst her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m14s)
01:20:14

[and she did something that was kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m16s)
01:20:16

[amazing she set up a second Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[account all right like a fake facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m22s)
01:20:22

[account and she was very interested in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m24s)
01:20:24

[the anti vex movement at the time so she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m27s)
01:20:27

[started following a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m30s)
01:20:30

[anti-vaxxers and visited a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m33s)
01:20:33

[anti-vaxxer links and so suddenly her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m36s)
01:20:36

[newsfeed starts getting full of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m40s)
01:20:40

[anti-vaxxer news along with other stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m42s)
01:20:42

[like chemtrails and deep state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m46s)
01:20:46

[conspiracy theories and all this stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m50s)
01:20:50

[and so she's like starts clicking on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m52s)
01:20:52

[those right and the more she clicked the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m56s)
01:20:56

[more hardcore far-out conspiracy stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h20m59s)
01:20:59

[facebook recommended so now when Renee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m03s)
01:21:03

[goes to that Facebook account the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m06s)
01:21:06

[thing is just full of angry crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m07s)
01:21:07

[far-out conspiracy stuff like that's all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m13s)
01:21:13

[she sees and so if that was your world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m17s)
01:21:17

[right then as far as you're concerned is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m19s)
01:21:19

[just like this continuous reminder and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m22s)
01:21:22

[proof of of all this stuff right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m26s)
01:21:26

[again it's like this this is to answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[your question this is the kind of ran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m33s)
01:21:33

[away feedback loop that ends up telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m35s)
01:21:35

[me and my generals you know throughout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m38s)
01:21:38

[their Facebook homepage that reinga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m41s)
01:21:41

[animals and fake news and whatever else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m45s)
01:21:45

[all right so you know it's it's a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m48s)
01:21:48

[this comes from also from bias right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m54s)
01:21:54

[so like let's talk about bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h21m58s)
01:21:58

[specifically so bias in image software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m00s)
01:22:00

[comes from bias in data and so most of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m04s)
01:22:04

[the folks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m09s)
01:22:09

[I know at Google brain building computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m10s)
01:22:10

[vision algorithms very few of them are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[people of color and so when they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m17s)
01:22:17

[training the algorithms with you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m20s)
01:22:20

[photos of their families and friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m21s)
01:22:21

[they are training them with very few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m23s)
01:22:23

[people of color and so when face up then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m25s)
01:22:25

[decided we're gonna try looking at lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m29s)
01:22:29

[of Instagram photos to see which ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m31s)
01:22:31

[are like you know I've voted the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m35s)
01:22:35

[without them necessarily realizing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m37s)
01:22:37

[the answer was like you know light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m40s)
01:22:40

[colored faces so then they built a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m42s)
01:22:42

[generative model to make you more hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m45s)
01:22:45

[and so this is the actual photo and here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m47s)
01:22:47

[is the hotter version right so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m50s)
01:22:50

[harder version is like more white less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m53s)
01:22:53

[nostrils you know more european-looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h22m56s)
01:22:56

[right and so like this did not go down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m00s)
01:23:00

[well to say the least so like that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m03s)
01:23:03

[again you know I don't think anybody at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m07s)
01:23:07

[face app said like let's create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[something that makes people look more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m12s)
01:23:12

[white right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m14s)
01:23:14

[they just trained it on a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m15s)
01:23:15

[images of the people that they had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m17s)
01:23:17

[around them okay and this has kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m19s)
01:23:19

[you know serious commercial implications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m23s)
01:23:23

[as well they had to pull this feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m26s)
01:23:26

[right and they had a huge amount of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m28s)
01:23:28

[negative pushback like ads a short right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m30s)
01:23:30

[here's another example Google photos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m33s)
01:23:33

[created this photo classifier airplane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m36s)

[skyscrapers cars graduation and no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m41s)
01:23:41

[guerrillas right so like think about how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m43s)
01:23:43

[this looks to like most people like most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h23m47s)

[call them gorillas like that's what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h24m00s)

[looks like right now we know that's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h24m02s)

[people of what okay right so like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h25m06s)

[pronoun in Turkish which has no gender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h25m29s)

[cut him no okay no he visit she but of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h25m35s)
01:25:35

[course in English we don't really have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h25m38s)

[widely used and gendered singular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h25m40s)

[to this okay now there are plenty of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h25m46s)

[people who saw this online and said like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h25m53s)
01:25:53

[literally so what you know it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h25m56s)

[correctly feeding back the usual usage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h25m59s)

[it's just telling us how things are and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m12s)
01:26:12

[like from a point of view that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m15s)
01:26:15

[entirely true right like the biased data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m17s)
01:26:17

[to create this biased algorithm is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m20s)

[actual data of how people are written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m24s)

[books and newspaper articles for decades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m26s)
01:26:26

[but does that mean that this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m31s)
01:26:31

[product that you want to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m35s)
01:26:35

[you know does this mean this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m36s)
01:26:36

[product you have to create but just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m38s)
01:26:38

[because the particular way you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m41s)

[trained the model means it ends up doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m43s)

[this you know is this actually the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m45s)

[design you want and can you think of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m47s)
01:26:47

[potential negative implications and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m50s)
01:26:50

[feedback loops this could create no and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h26m53s)

[a new cool engineering problem to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m00s)

[on like how do I create unbiased and RP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m01s)
01:27:01

[solutions and now there are some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m05s)
01:27:05

[startups starting to do that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m06s)
01:27:06

[starting to make some money right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m08s)
01:27:08

[like opera these are opportunities for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m10s)
01:27:10

[you it's like hey here's some stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m12s)
01:27:12

[where people are creating screwed up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m14s)
01:27:14

[societal outcomes because of their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m16s)
01:27:16

[shitty models like okay well you can go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m18s)
01:27:18

[and build something better right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m21s)
01:27:21

[so like another example of the bias in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m22s)
01:27:22

[word lévesque word vectors is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m25s)
01:27:25

[restaurant reviews ranked Mexican](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m28s)
01:27:28

[restaurants worse because Mexico the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m30s)
01:27:30

[Mexican words tend to be associated with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m33s)
01:27:33

[criminal words in the u.s. press and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m36s)
01:27:36

[books more often again this is like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m39s)
01:27:39

[real problem that is happening right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m42s)
01:27:42

[so you know Rachel actually did some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m44s)
01:27:44

[interesting analysis of just the plain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m50s)
01:27:50

[word for backward vectors where she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m53s)
01:27:53

[basically pulled them out and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m56s)
01:27:56

[looked at these analogies based on some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h27m58s)
01:27:58

[research that had been done elsewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m00s)
01:28:00

[and so you can see like where to Vic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m03s)
01:28:03

[like the the vector directions show that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m05s)
01:28:05

[father is the doctor is the mother is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m08s)
01:28:08

[too nervous man is too computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m10s)
01:28:10

[programmer as women is the homemaker and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m12s)
01:28:12

[so forth right so like it's it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m14s)
01:28:14

[easy to see what's in these word vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m17s)
01:28:17

[and you know they're kind of fundamental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m21s)
01:28:21

[to much of the NLP you're probably just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m24s)
01:28:24

[about all the NLP software we use today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m26s)
01:28:26

[so like here's a great example so a pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m30s)
01:28:30

[public has actually done a lot of good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m35s)
01:28:35

[work in this area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m37s)
01:28:37

[judges many judges now have access to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m41s)
01:28:41

[sentencing guideline software and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m44s)
01:28:44

[Sentencing Guidelines software says to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m47s)
01:28:47

[the judge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m49s)
01:28:49

[for this individual we would recommend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m50s)
01:28:50

[this kind of sentence right and now of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m52s)
01:28:52

[course a judge doesn't understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m56s)
01:28:56

[machine learning so like they have two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h28m58s)
01:28:58

[choices which is either do what it says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m00s)
01:29:00

[or ignore it entirely right and some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m02s)
01:29:02

[people fall into each category right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m05s)
01:29:05

[so for the ones that fall into the like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m08s)
01:29:08

[do what it says category here's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m10s)
01:29:10

[happens for those that were labeled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m12s)
01:29:12

[higher risk right the subset of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m14s)
01:29:14

[that label high risk but actually turned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m18s)
01:29:18

[out not to rear fender quarter of whites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m19s)
01:29:19

[and about 1/2 of african-americans okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m23s)
01:29:23

[so like nearly twice as often right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m27s)
01:29:27

[people who didn't really marked as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m32s)
01:29:32

[higher risk if they're african-american](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m34s)
01:29:34

[and vice versa amongst those labeled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m37s)
01:29:37

[lower risk but actually did reoffended](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m40s)
01:29:40

[to be about half of the whites and only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m44s)
01:29:44

[28% of the african-americans like so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m47s)
01:29:47

[like this is data which I I would like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m49s)
01:29:49

[to think nobody is setting out to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m52s)
01:29:52

[something that does this right but when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m55s)
01:29:55

[you start with bias data right and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h29m57s)
01:29:57

[know the data says that whites and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m02s)
01:30:02

[blacks smoke marijuana at about the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m07s)
01:30:07

[rate that blacks are jailed at I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m09s)
01:30:09

[it's something like five times more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m14s)
01:30:14

[often than whites like you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m15s)
01:30:15

[nature of the justice system in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m17s)
01:30:17

[or at least at the moment is that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m19s)
01:30:19

[not it's not equal it's not fair and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m22s)
01:30:22

[therefore the data that's fed into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m24s)
01:30:24

[machine learning model is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m27s)
01:30:27

[basically support that status quo and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m29s)
01:30:29

[then because of the negative feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m31s)
01:30:31

[loop it's just going to get worse and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m32s)
01:30:32

[worse right now I'll tell you something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m35s)
01:30:35

[else interesting about this one which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m37s)
01:30:37

[research court erred Gong has pointed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m38s)
01:30:38

[out is here are some of the questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m40s)
01:30:40

[that are being asked right so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m43s)
01:30:43

[let's take one was your father ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m45s)
01:30:45

[arrested right so your answer to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m51s)
01:30:51

[question it's going to decide whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m54s)
01:30:54

[you're locked up and for how long now as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h30m57s)
01:30:57

[a machine learning researcher do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m01s)
01:31:01

[think that might improve the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m03s)
01:31:03

[active accuracy of your algorithm and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m04s)
01:31:04

[get you a better r-squared it could well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m06s)
01:31:06

[but I don't know you know maybe it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m09s)
01:31:09

[you try it out so oh I've got a bit of R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m11s)
01:31:11

[squared so does that mean you should use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m13s)
01:31:13

[it like well there's another question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m15s)
01:31:15

[like do you think it's reasonable to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m18s)
01:31:18

[lock somebody up for longer because of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m20s)
01:31:20

[who their dad was that and yet these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m23s)
01:31:23

[actually the examples of questions that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m25s)
01:31:25

[we are asking right now to offenders and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m28s)
01:31:28

[then putting into a machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m32s)
01:31:32

[system to decide what happens to them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m33s)
01:31:33

[okay so again like whoever designed this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m36s)
01:31:36

[presumably they were like laser focused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m39s)
01:31:39

[on technical excellence getting the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m42s)
01:31:42

[maximum area under the ROC curve and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m44s)
01:31:44

[found these great predictors that give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m47s)
01:31:47

[me another 0.02 right and I guess didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m49s)
01:31:49

[stop to think like well is that a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m53s)
01:31:53

[reasonable way to decide who goes to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m55s)
01:31:55

[jail for longer so like putting this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h31m58s)
01:31:58

[together you can kind of see how this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m04s)
01:32:04

[can that you know more and more scary we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m06s)
01:32:06

[take a company like taser right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m12s)
01:32:12

[tasers are these devices that kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m14s)
01:32:14

[give you a big electric shock basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m17s)
01:32:17

[and tasers manage to do a great job of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m19s)
01:32:19

[creating strong relationships with some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m22s)
01:32:22

[academic researchers who seem to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m25s)
01:32:25

[whatever they tell them to say to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m27s)
01:32:27

[extent where now if you look at the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m30s)
01:32:30

[it turns out that there's a much higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m32s)
01:32:32

[problem you know there's a pretty high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m35s)
01:32:35

[probability that if you get tased that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m36s)
01:32:36

[you all die it happens you know not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m39s)
01:32:39

[unusually and yet you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m43s)
01:32:43

[researchers who they've paid to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m45s)
01:32:45

[into this have consistently come back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m47s)
01:32:47

[and said oh no it was nothing to do with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m49s)
01:32:49

[the Taser the fact that they died](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m52s)
01:32:52

[immediately afterwards was totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m53s)
01:32:53

[unrelated it was just a random you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m55s)
01:32:55

[things things happen so this company now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h32m59s)
01:32:59

[owns 80% of the market for body cameras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m02s)
01:33:02

[and they've started buying computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m06s)
01:33:06

[vision AI companies and they're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m09s)
01:33:09

[try and now use these police body camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m12s)
01:33:12

[videos to anticipate criminal activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m14s)
01:33:14

[okay and so like what does that mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m18s)
01:33:18

[right so is that like okay I now have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m21s)
01:33:21

[some augmented reality display saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m23s)
01:33:23

[like pays this person because they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m25s)
01:33:25

[about to do something bad you know so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m29s)
01:33:29

[it's like it's kind of like a whirring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m33s)
01:33:33

[direction and so you know I'm sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m36s)
01:33:36

[nobody who's a data scientist at taser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m38s)
01:33:38

[or at the companies that they bought out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m41s)
01:33:41

[is thinking like you know this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m43s)
01:33:43

[world I want to help create that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m45s)
01:33:45

[could find themselves in you know or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m49s)
01:33:49

[could find yourself in the middle of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m51s)
01:33:51

[this kind of discussion where it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m52s)
01:33:52

[explicitly about that topic but there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m55s)
01:33:55

[part of you that's just like wow I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h33m57s)
01:33:57

[wonder if this is how this could be used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m00s)
01:34:00

[right and and you know I don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m02s)
01:34:02

[exactly what the right thing to do in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m04s)
01:34:04

[that situation is because like you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m06s)
01:34:06

[ask and of course people gonna be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m07s)
01:34:07

[no no no no so it's like you know are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m09s)
01:34:09

[you gonna you know what what could you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m14s)
01:34:14

[do know you could like ask for some kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m16s)
01:34:16

[of written promise you could decide to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m19s)
01:34:19

[leave you could you know start doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[some research into the legality of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m25s)
01:34:25

[things to say like oh I would at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[protect my own you know legal situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m29s)
01:34:29

[I don't know like have a think about how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m32s)
01:34:32

[you would respond to that so these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m34s)
01:34:34

[some questions that reaction Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m40s)
01:34:40

[created as being things to think about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m42s)
01:34:42

[right so if you're looking at building a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m44s)
01:34:44

[data product or you know using a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m47s)
01:34:47

[like if you're building machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m49s)
01:34:49

[model is your a reason okay if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m51s)
01:34:51

[trying to do something right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m54s)
01:34:54

[so what bias may be in that data right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m56s)
01:34:56

[because whatever bias is in that data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h34m58s)
01:34:58

[ends up being a bias in your predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m00s)
01:35:00

[potentially then biases the actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m02s)
01:35:02

[you're influencing potentially then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m04s)
01:35:04

[biases the data that you come back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m06s)
01:35:06

[you may get a feedback loop if the team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m08s)
01:35:08

[that built it isn't diverse you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m10s)
01:35:10

[what might you be missing yeah so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m13s)
01:35:13

[example one senior executive at Twitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m16s)
01:35:16

[called the alarm about major Russian bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m22s)
01:35:22

[problems at Twitter way back well before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m28s)
01:35:28

[the election that was the one black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m31s)
01:35:31

[person in the exact team a Twitter the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m38s)
01:35:38

[one and shortly afterwards they lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m41s)
01:35:41

[their job right and so like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m44s)
01:35:44

[definitely having a more diverse team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m47s)
01:35:47

[that means having a more diverse set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m49s)
01:35:49

[opinions and beliefs and ideas and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m52s)
01:35:52

[things to look for and so forth so non](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m55s)
01:35:55

[diverse teams seem to make more of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h35m58s)
01:35:58

[bad mistakes can we order a code as an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m00s)
01:36:00

[open-source check for the different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m05s)
01:36:05

[error rates amongst different groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m07s)
01:36:07

[it's there like a simple rule we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m09s)
01:36:09

[use instead that's like extremely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m12s)
01:36:12

[interpretive all and easy to communicate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m13s)
01:36:13

[and like you know if something goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m15s)
01:36:15

[wrong do we have a good way to deal with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m18s)
01:36:18

[it okay so when when we've talked to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m20s)
01:36:20

[people about this and a lot of people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m26s)
01:36:26

[like have come to Rachel and said like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m27s)
01:36:27

[I'm I'm concerned about something my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m29s)
01:36:29

[organization's doing you know what do I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m32s)
01:36:32

[do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m34s)
01:36:34

[or I'm just concerned about my toxic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m35s)
01:36:35

[workplace what do I do and very often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m38s)
01:36:38

[you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m42s)
01:36:42

[Rachel will say like well have you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m44s)
01:36:44

[considered leaving and they will say all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m46s)
01:36:46

[I I don't want to lose my job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m48s)
01:36:48

[but actually if you can code you're in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m51s)
01:36:51

[like 0.3 percent of the population if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m54s)
01:36:54

[you can code and do machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m57s)
01:36:57

[you're in probably like 0.01 percent of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h36m59s)
01:36:59

[the population you are massively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m02s)
01:37:02

[massively in demand so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m03s)
01:37:03

[realistically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m09s)
01:37:09

[you know obviously it's an organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m10s)

[does not want you to feel like you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m13s)
01:37:13

[somebody who could just leave and get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m15s)
01:37:15

[another job that's not in your interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m16s)
01:37:16

[in their interest but that is absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m17s)
01:37:17

[true right and so one of the things I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m20s)
01:37:20

[hope you'll leave this course with is is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m23s)
01:37:23

[enough self-confidence to recognize that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m26s)
01:37:26

[you have the skills you know to get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m29s)
01:37:29

[get a job and particularly once you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m33s)
01:37:33

[got your first job your second job is an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m35s)
01:37:35

[order of magnitude easier right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m37s)
01:37:37

[you know this is important not just so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m40s)
01:37:40

[that you feel like you actually have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m42s)
01:37:42

[ability to act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m43s)
01:37:43

[ethically but it's also important to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m45s)
01:37:45

[realize like if you find yourself in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m48s)
01:37:48

[toxic environment right which is which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m50s)
01:37:50

[is pretty damn common unfortunately like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m53s)
01:37:53

[there's a lot of shitty tech cultures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m56s)
01:37:56

[environments particularly in the Bay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h37m59s)
01:37:59

[Area right you find yourself in one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m01s)
01:38:01

[those environments the best thing to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m03s)
01:38:03

[is to get the hell out right and and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m07s)
01:38:07

[you don't have the self-confidence to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m09s)
01:38:09

[think you can get another job you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m12s)
01:38:12

[get trapped right so you know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m15s)

[to know that you are leaving this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m21s)
01:38:21

[program with very in demand skills and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m23s)
01:38:23

[particularly after you have that first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m25s)
01:38:25

[job you'll nail somebody with in-demand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m27s)
01:38:27

[skills and a track record of being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m29s)
01:38:29

[employed in that area okay okay great so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m32s)
01:38:32

[yes this is kind of just a broad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m39s)
01:38:39

[question but what are some things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m42s)
01:38:42

[you know of that people are doing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m46s)
01:38:46

[treat bias in data you know it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m47s)
01:38:47

[like a bit of a controversial subject at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m52s)
01:38:52

[the moment and there are there are like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m54s)
01:38:54

[people are trying to use some people try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h38m58s)
01:38:58

[to use an algorithmic approach you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m00s)
01:39:00

[where they're basically trying to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m02s)
01:39:02

[how can we identify the bias and kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m03s)
01:39:03

[like subtract it out but like that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m06s)
01:39:06

[most effective ways I know of the ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m10s)
01:39:10

[that are trying to treat it at the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m12s)
01:39:12

[level so like start with a more diverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m14s)
01:39:14

[team particularly a team involved it you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m17s)
01:39:17

[know and concludes people from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m19s)
01:39:19

[humanities like sociologists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m20s)

01:39:22

[understand feedback loops and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m24s)
01:39:24

[implications for human behavior and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m26s)
01:39:26

[tend to be equipped with you know good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m29s)
01:39:29

[tools for kind of identifying and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m32s)
01:39:32

[tracking these kinds of problems and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m35s)
01:39:35

[and then kind of trying to incorporate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m38s)
01:39:38

[the solutions into the process itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xFdhfUnvQ#t=01h39m39s)
01:39:39
