00:01:56

[like it assumes an intelligent reader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h01m59s)

00:05:28

[turns out to use something called daikon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m30s)
00:05:30

[here are the plates and daikon libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m32s)

[and we try to use them and these are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[things they've got it's kind of confused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m36s)
00:05:36

[and these are the ways that we solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m37s)
00:05:37

[them and here's a place a notebook which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m39s)
00:05:39

[shows you some of the main ways you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m41s)
00:05:41

[look at these daikon for instance so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m43s)
00:05:43

[know split up your project into little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m47s)
00:05:47

[pieces it's like when you enter a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m49s)
00:05:49

[careful composition I always tell people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m52s)
00:05:52

[submit every single day and try and put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[in at least half an hour a day to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h05m58s)
00:05:58

[it slightly better than yesterday so how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m01s)
00:06:01

[do you put in the first day submission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m03s)
00:06:03

[so what I always do on the first day is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m04s)
00:06:04

[to submit the benchmark script you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m07s)
00:06:07

[which is generally like all zeroes and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m10s)
00:06:10

[then the next day I try to improve it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m12s)
00:06:12

[I'll put in like all 0.5 the next day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m14s)

[achieve where else if you wait 2 months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m27s)
00:06:27

[and spend all that time reading papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m30s)
00:06:30

[and theorizing and thinking about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m32s)

[best possible approach you'll discover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h06m33s)

00:08:57

[learn a lot more by trying it yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h09m00s)
00:09:00

[and particularly if you try it yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h09m01s)
00:09:01

[and can't figure out how to do it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h09m03s)

[the category yes so it's a it's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m04s)

[interesting problem but one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m09s)

[things interesting about it is is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m10s)
00:10:10

[okay we have to use all of imagenet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m12s)
00:10:12

[which has its own challenges so last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m15s)
00:10:15

[week we got to the point where we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m18s)
00:10:18

[created the word vectors and remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m21s)
00:10:21

[the word vectors we then had to like map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m24s)
00:10:24

[them to imagenet categories there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m27s)
00:10:27

[thousand imagenet categories so we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m29s)
00:10:29

[to create the work vector V each one we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m31s)
00:10:31

[didn't quite get all of them to match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m33s)
00:10:33

[it's something like two thirds of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m35s)
00:10:35

[match so we're working on like two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m36s)
00:10:36

[thirds of imagenet we've got as far as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m38s)
00:10:38

[reading all the bio names the imagenet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m42s)
00:10:42

[and we then we're going to resize our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m44s)
00:10:44

[images so I'm going to resize all of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[images to 224 by 224 it's I think it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m53s)
00:10:53

[good idea to do some of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h10m59s)
00:10:59

[pre-processing up front something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m00s)

[tends to flow and apply towards both to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m04s)
00:11:04

[and care us recently started doing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m07s)
00:11:07

[that if you use a generator it actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m10s)
00:11:10

[does the image pre-processing in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m13s)
00:11:13

[number of separate threads in parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m17s)
00:11:17

[behind the scenes and so some of this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m18s)
00:11:18

[a little less important than it was six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m21s)

[months ago when clear us didn't do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m24s)

[you know it used to be that we had to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m25s)
00:11:25

[spend a long time waiting for our data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m28s)

[to get processed before it could get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m31s)
00:11:31

[into the into the CNN um having said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m33s)

[large JPEGs just reading them off the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m42s)

[quite a long time so I always like to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m49s)

[put it in to do all that resizing up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h11m51s)

00:12:16

[doing the resizing first is that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h12m19s)
00:12:19

[makes it a lot smaller and you probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h12m21s)
00:12:21

[can then fit it on your SSD there's lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h12m22s)

[of reasons that I think this is good so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h12m25s)

[start with something that's not square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h12m58s)

00:13:18

[throwing away information you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[you're not using the full size of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m22s)
00:13:22

[image and indeed every other library or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m24s)
00:13:24

[pretty much paper I've seen uses a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m29s)
00:13:29

[different approach which is to resize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m30s)
00:13:30

[the smaller side of the image to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m33s)
00:13:33

[square and now the big that now the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m37s)
00:13:37

[larger size is now too big for your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m39s)
00:13:39

[square so you crop off the top and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m41s)
00:13:41

[bottom or crop off the left and right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m44s)
00:13:44

[this is called center cropping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m46s)
00:13:46

[Center cropping approach so I understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m50s)
00:13:50

[continuing to learn with Google and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m56s)
00:13:56

[said after that your time waiting on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h13m59s)
00:13:59

[data those scenes ledger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m02s)
00:14:02

[I'm through here this okay that's true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m04s)
00:14:04

[what you're doing is throwing away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m09s)
00:14:09

[you're throwing away compute like like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m11s)
00:14:11

[with the one where you do send to crop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m14s)
00:14:14

[you have a complete 224 thing full of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m16s)
00:14:16

[meaningful pixels for us with a black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m18s)
00:14:18

[border you have like a 180 by 224 bit is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m20s)
00:14:20

[meaningful pixels and a whole bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m23s)
00:14:23

[like okay yeah that can be a problem so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m25s)
00:14:25

[it works well for image net because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m34s)
00:14:34

[image net things are generally somewhat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m37s)
00:14:37

[centered you may need to do some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m38s)
00:14:38

[initial set to do like a hate map or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m43s)
00:14:43

[something like to get in lesson seven to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m45s)
00:14:45

[figure out roughly where the thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m47s)
00:14:47

[before you decide where to send to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[crop so these things are all compromises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m50s)
00:14:50

[but I've got to say since I switched to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m53s)
00:14:53

[using this approach I feel like my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m55s)
00:14:55

[models are trained a lot faster and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[giving better results and certainly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h14m58s)
00:14:58

[super resolution okay now I said last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m00s)
00:15:00

[week that we are going to start looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m03s)
00:15:03

[at parallel processing and if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[wondering about last week's homework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m09s)
00:15:09

[we're going to get there but some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m10s)
00:15:10

[techniques were about to learn we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m12s)
00:15:12

[going to use to do last week so I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m13s)
00:15:13

[working even better so but don't worry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m15s)
00:15:15

[so what I want to do is I want to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m18s)
00:15:18

[I've got a a CPU with something like 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m20s)
00:15:20

[cores on it and then each of those calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m26s)
00:15:26

[have hyper threading so it means each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m29s)
00:15:29

[those calls can do kind of two things at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m30s)
00:15:30

[once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m32s)
00:15:32

[so I really want to be able to you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m32s)
00:15:32

[have a couple of dozen processes going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m34s)
00:15:34

[on each one resizing an image that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m37s)
00:15:37

[called parallel processing okay and just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m40s)
00:15:40

[to remind you this is as opposed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[vectorization or SIMD which is where a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[single thread operates on a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m49s)
00:15:49

[things at a time and so we learnt that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m51s)
00:15:51

[to get SSD working you just have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m53s)
00:15:53

[install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m54s)
00:15:54

[hello SIMD and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m55s)
00:15:55

[this happened in six hundred percents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h15m59s)
00:15:59

[data I tried it it works now we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[to as well as a 600 percent speed-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m03s)
00:16:03

[also get another and on 20x speed up by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m05s)
00:16:05

[doing parallel processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m08s)
00:16:08

[the basic approach to parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m11s)
00:16:11

[processing in Python 3 is to set up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m13s)
00:16:13

[something called either a process pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m18s)
00:16:18

[or a thread pool so the idea here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m20s)
00:16:20

[that we've got a number of little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m23s)
00:16:23

[programs running threads or processes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m24s)
00:16:24

[and when we set up that pool we say how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[many of those little programs do we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m31s)
00:16:31

[to fire up ok and then what we do is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m32s)
00:16:32

[say ok now I want you to use all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m35s)
00:16:35

[their code workers I want you to use all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m40s)
00:16:40

[of those workers to do some thing right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m42s)
00:16:42

[and the easiest way to do is being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m45s)
00:16:45

[inside some tree is to use Matt a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m47s)
00:16:47

[you probably used how many of you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m50s)
00:16:50

[used Matt before okay so for those you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m52s)
00:16:52

[who haven't maps is a very common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m54s)
00:16:54

[functional programming construct that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m57s)
00:16:57

[found its way into lots of other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m58s)
00:16:58

[languages which simply says look through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h16m59s)
00:16:59

[a collection and call a function on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m02s)
00:17:02

[everything in that collection and return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[a new collection which is the result of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m07s)
00:17:07

[calling that function on that thing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m10s)
00:17:10

[our case the function is resized and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m11s)
00:17:11

[collection is in Internet images well in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m14s)
00:17:14

[fact the collection is a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m18s)
00:17:18

[numbers 0 1 2 3 4 and so forth and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m22s)
00:17:22

[the resize image is going to do is it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m25s)
00:17:25

[going to open that image of disk access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m28s)
00:17:28

[turning the number 3 into the third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m31s)
00:17:31

[image resize to 224 by 224 and will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m35s)
00:17:35

[return that so the general approach here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m38s)
00:17:38

[this is basically what it looks like to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m41s)
00:17:41

[do parallel processing in Python it may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m43s)
00:17:43

[look a bit weird we're going result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m48s)
00:17:48

[equals exact map and this is a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m50s)
00:17:50

[I want this is the thing to map over and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m55s)
00:17:55

[then I'm saying for each thing in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m57s)
00:17:57

[list do something now this might make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h17m59s)
00:17:59

[you think we'll wait there's nothing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m02s)
00:18:02

[this list has to have enough memory to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m03s)
00:18:03

[every single resize image and the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m06s)
00:18:06

[is no no it doesn't one of the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m10s)
00:18:10

[that Python 3 uses a lot more is using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[these things they're called generators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m16s)
00:18:16

[which is basically it's a something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m18s)
00:18:18

[looks like a list but it's lazy it only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m21s)
00:18:21

[creates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m24s)
00:18:24

[thing when you ask for it so as I append](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m25s)
00:18:25

[each image is going to give me that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m27s)
00:18:27

[image and if this mapping is not yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m30s)
00:18:30

[finished creating it it'll wait so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m32s)
00:18:32

[approach looks like it's going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m36s)
00:18:36

[heaps of memory but it doesn't it uses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m37s)
00:18:37

[only the minimum amount of memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m40s)
00:18:40

[necessary and it does everything in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m42s)
00:18:42

[parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m44s)
00:18:44

[so resize image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m46s)
00:18:46

[is something which is going to open up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m52s)
00:18:52

[the image it's going to turn it into an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m54s)
00:18:54

[umpire ray and then it's going to resize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m56s)
00:18:56

[it okay and so then the resize of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h18m58s)
00:18:58

[center cropping we just mentioned and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[then after it's resize it's going to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[appended what is append image to so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m05s)
00:19:05

[is a bit weird what's going on here what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m10s)
00:19:10

[it does is it says is it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m14s)
00:19:14

[actually take it into what we call a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m16s)
00:19:16

[pre-allocated array so we're learning a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m19s)
00:19:19

[lot of computer science concepts here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m23s)
00:19:23

[anybody that's done computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m24s)
00:19:24

[before which familiar with all of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m26s)
00:19:26

[already if you haven't you probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m27s)
00:19:27

[won't but it's important to know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m30s)
00:19:30

[the slowest thing in your computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m32s)
00:19:32

[generally speaking is allocating memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m35s)
00:19:35

[it's finding some memory it's reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m38s)
00:19:38

[stuff from that memories writing to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m41s)
00:19:41

[memory and let's suppose it's like cache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m43s)
00:19:43

[or something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m45s)
00:19:45

[and generally speaking if you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m46s)
00:19:46

[create lots and lots of arrays and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[throw them away again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m51s)
00:19:51

[that's likely to be really really slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m51s)
00:19:51

[and so what I wanted to do was to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m54s)
00:19:54

[a single 224 by 224 array which is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h19m56s)
00:19:56

[to contain my resize image and then I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m00s)
00:20:00

[going to append that to my big holes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m02s)
00:20:02

[tensor so but where you do that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m06s)
00:20:06

[Python it's it's wonderfully easy you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m12s)
00:20:12

[can create a variable from this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m17s)
00:20:17

[called threading local now DL is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m21s)
00:20:21

[just a it's basically something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m24s)
00:20:24

[looks a bit like a dictionary it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[very special kind of dictionary it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[going to create a separate copy of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m30s)
00:20:30

[for every thread or process so normally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m32s)
00:20:32

[when you've got lots of things happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m36s)
00:20:36

[at once it's going to be a real pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m38s)
00:20:38

[because if two things try to use it at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m40s)
00:20:40

[the same time you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m41s)
00:20:41

[bad results or even crashes but if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m44s)
00:20:44

[allocate a variable like this it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m47s)
00:20:47

[automatically creates a separate copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m50s)
00:20:50

[and every threat and you don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m52s)
00:20:52

[worry about locks you don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m54s)
00:20:54

[worry about race conditions whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m55s)
00:20:55

[so once I've created this special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h20m58s)
00:20:58

[threading local variable I then create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m01s)
00:21:01

[safe folder inside it which is just an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[array of zeros of size 224 by 224 by 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m07s)
00:21:07

[and so then later on I create my big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m10s)
00:21:10

[holes array which is where I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m14s)
00:21:14

[put everything eventually and to append](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[the image i graph the bit of the image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m18s)
00:21:18

[that I want and I put it into that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m21s)
00:21:21

[pre-allocated that pre-allocated threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m24s)
00:21:24

[local variable and then I can let my big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m29s)
00:21:29

[holes array so there's lots of detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m32s)
00:21:32

[here in terms of lag using parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m37s)
00:21:37

[processing effectively I wanted to kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m41s)
00:21:41

[of briefly mention it not because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m43s)

[think somebody who hasn't thirty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m45s)

[computer science is now going to go OK I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m46s)
00:21:46

[totally understood all that but to give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h21m48s)

[true things can't happen at the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h22m27s)

[simd actually you don't have to worry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h22m46s)
00:22:46

[about that and I can prove it to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h22m49s)
00:22:49

[even if they drew a little picture here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h22m51s)
00:22:51

[is the result right of serial versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h22m55s)

[version is six times bigger than this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m02s)

[right so the kind of default place and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m04s)
00:23:04

[code you would have written maybe before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m08s)
00:23:08

[today's course would have been 120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m09s)

[seconds process 2,000 images with SIMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m12s)
00:23:12

[at 25 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m18s)
00:23:18

[with the protest pool at eight seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m21s)
00:23:21

[for three workers for six workers it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m23s)
00:23:23

[five seconds so on and so forth the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m25s)

[thread pool is even better 3.6 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m28s)

[to 12 workers 3.2 seconds at 16 workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m30s)
00:23:30

[now your mileage will vary depending on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m34s)
00:23:34

[what CPU you have given the that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m38s)
00:23:38

[probably quite a lot of you are using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m41s)

[using the t2 but you should try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m48s)
00:23:48

[something like this right which is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m49s)
00:23:49

[try different numbers of workers and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m51s)
00:23:51

[what's the optimal for that particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m54s)
00:23:54

[CPU and now once you've done that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m56s)
00:23:56

[know once I went beyond 16 I didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h23m58s)
00:23:58

[really get improvements so I know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m01s)
00:24:01

[on that computer a thread pool of size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m03s)
00:24:03

[16 is a pretty good choice and as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m06s)
00:24:06

[can see once you get into the right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m09s)
00:24:09

[general vicinity it doesn't vary too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m10s)
00:24:10

[much and so as long as you're roughly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m13s)
00:24:13

[okay there's behind to Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m15s)
00:24:15

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m18s)
00:24:18

[so that's the general approach here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m22s)
00:24:22

[run through something in parallel each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m24s)
00:24:24

[time appender to my big holes array and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m26s)
00:24:26

[at the end of that I've got a big holes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[array which I can use again and again so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m31s)
00:24:31

[I don't rerun that code very often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m33s)
00:24:33

[anymore I've got all of the image net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m35s)
00:24:35

[resized into each of 72 by 72 to 24 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m37s)
00:24:37

[to 88 so I just and I give them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m41s)
00:24:41

[different names and I just use them for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m43s)
00:24:43

[our image of serving so the food they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m49s)
00:24:49

[are consuming recycle some number and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m54s)
00:24:54

[we'll just squish the title to square I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m56s)
00:24:56

[mean I usually will distort it but Brad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h24m59s)
00:24:59

[hopefuls right in fact I think that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[what Paris does nothing about helping it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m03s)
00:25:03

[squishes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m05s)
00:25:05

[yeah I okay so here's one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m07s)
00:25:07

[things I'm not quite sure right my guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m10s)
00:25:10

[was that I don't think it's a good idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m13s)
00:25:13

[because you're now going to have dogs of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m15s)
00:25:15

[various different squish levels and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m18s)
00:25:18

[you'll see an N is going to have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m20s)
00:25:20

[learn that thing right it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[have it's got another type of you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m24s)
00:25:24

[symmetry to learn about you know level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m28s)
00:25:28

[of squishiness wealth if we keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m31s)
00:25:31

[everything the same kind of aspect ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m33s)
00:25:33

[I think it's going to be easier to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[so we'll get better results with a C+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m41s)
00:25:41

[training yeah I that's my theory and I'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m42s)
00:25:42

[be fascinated for somebody to do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m46s)
00:25:46

[really in-depth analysis of like black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[borders versus center cropping versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[squishing good image - okay so for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m53s)
00:25:53

[we can just open the big holes array and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h25m58s)
00:25:58

[there we go so we're now ready to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m00s)
00:26:00

[our model and run through this pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m03s)
00:26:03

[quickly because most of its pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m05s)
00:26:05

[boring the basic idea here is that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m07s)
00:26:07

[need to create an array of labels which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m09s)
00:26:09

[are called vexed which contains for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m12s)
00:26:12

[every image in my in my vehicles array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[needs to contain the word vector but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m20s)
00:26:20

[then the target word vector for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m22s)
00:26:22

[image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m24s)
00:26:24

[and just remind you last week we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m25s)
00:26:25

[randomly ordered the file ends so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m30s)
00:26:30

[they called array is in random order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[okay so we've got our labels which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m38s)
00:26:38

[the work vectors for every image we need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m41s)
00:26:41

[to do our normal pre-processing this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m44s)
00:26:44

[a handy way to pre-process in the new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m48s)
00:26:48

[version of chaos we're using the normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m53s)
00:26:53

[Clara ResNet model the one that comes in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m56s)
00:26:56

[Kherson applications it doesn't do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h26m59s)
00:26:59

[pre-processing for you but if you create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m02s)
00:27:02

[a lambda layer it does the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m06s)
00:27:06

[pre-processing and you can use that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m08s)
00:27:08

[lambda layer as the input tensor so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m11s)
00:27:11

[whole thing now we'll do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m14s)
00:27:14

[pre-processing automatically without you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m18s)
00:27:18

[having to worry about it so that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m20s)
00:27:20

[good little trick I'm not sure it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m21s)
00:27:21

[quite as neat as what we did in part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m24s)
00:27:24

[where we put it in the model itself but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m26s)
00:27:26

[at least this way we don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m30s)
00:27:30

[maintain a whole separate version of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m31s)
00:27:31

[of the models so that's kind of what I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m33s)
00:27:33

[doing nowadays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m37s)
00:27:37

[all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m40s)
00:27:40

[when you're working on really big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m44s)
00:27:44

[datasets you don't want to process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m45s)
00:27:45

[things any more than necessary and any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m49s)
00:27:49

[more time necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m51s)
00:27:51

[I know ahead of time but I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m53s)
00:27:53

[want to do some fine-tuning so what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m55s)
00:27:55

[decided to do was I decided you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h27m58s)
00:27:58

[this is the particular layer where I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m01s)
00:28:01

[going to do my fine-tuning so I decided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[to first of all create a model which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m06s)
00:28:06

[started at the input and went as far as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m09s)
00:28:09

[this layer and so my first step was to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[create that model and save the results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[of that and then I was you know the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m21s)
00:28:21

[step will be to take that intermediate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m24s)
00:28:24

[step and take it to the next stage I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m26s)
00:28:26

[would have fine-tuned to and save that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[so it's a little shortcut there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m30s)
00:28:30

[couple of really important intricacies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m33s)
00:28:33

[to be aware of here though the first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m36s)
00:28:36

[is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m39s)
00:28:39

[you'll notice that ResNet and inception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m41s)
00:28:41

[are not used very often to transfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m44s)
00:28:44

[learning and again this is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m46s)
00:28:46

[which I've not seen studies and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m51s)
00:28:51

[actually think it's a really important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m53s)
00:28:53

[thing to study is which of these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m54s)
00:28:54

[work best transfer learning but I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m57s)
00:28:57

[one of the difficulties is just resonate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h28m59s)
00:28:59

[and inception the harder and the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m01s)
00:29:01

[they're harder is that if you look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m04s)
00:29:04

[resinate you've got lots and lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m06s)
00:29:06

[layers which make no sense on their own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m09s)
00:29:09

[get over inception because if I keep on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m11s)
00:29:11

[splitting into two bits and then merging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m13s)
00:29:13

[again splitting into two bits and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m15s)
00:29:15

[noticing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m16s)
00:29:16

[so what I did was I looked in at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m17s)
00:29:17

[care our source code to kind of find out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m23s)
00:29:23

[okay how is each block named and because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m25s)
00:29:25

[what I wanted to do was to say alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m29s)
00:29:29

[we've got you know a resident block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m31s)
00:29:31

[we've just had a merge okay and then it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m34s)
00:29:34

[goes out it does a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m37s)
00:29:37

[convolutions and then it comes back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m39s)
00:29:39

[does an addition right and basically I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[want to get one of these I want to grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[one of these unfortunately for some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m49s)
00:29:49

[reason chaos does not name these merge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m51s)
00:29:51

[cells so what I had to do was get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m54s)
00:29:54

[next cell and then go back by one and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h29m59s)
00:29:59

[it kind of shows you how little people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m03s)
00:30:03

[have been working with ResNet with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m05s)
00:30:05

[transfer learning is it like literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m07s)
00:30:07

[the only bit of it the next chance to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m08s)
00:30:08

[transfer learn from a nameless in one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[the most popular probably the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m15s)
00:30:15

[popular thing for transfer learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[isostatic care us okay there's a second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m18s)
00:30:18

[complexity when working with ResNet we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m24s)
00:30:24

[haven't discussed this much but renting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m28s)
00:30:28

[it actually has two kinds of ResNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m30s)
00:30:30

[blocks while it is this kind which is an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m31s)
00:30:31

[identity block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m36s)
00:30:36

[and the second time is a redneck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m39s)
00:30:39

[convolution block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m42s)
00:30:42

[and which I also call a bottleneck block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m45s)
00:30:45

[and what this is is it's pretty similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m51s)
00:30:51

[you know what one thing that's going up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m54s)
00:30:54

[through a couple of convolutions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m56s)
00:30:56

[then goes and gets added together but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h30m58s)
00:30:58

[the other side is not an identity the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m00s)
00:31:00

[other side is a single convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m02s)
00:31:02

[and in ResNet they throw in one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m07s)
00:31:07

[every half a dozen blocks or so why is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m10s)
00:31:10

[that well the reason is that if you only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m15s)
00:31:15

[have identity blocks and all it can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m18s)
00:31:18

[really do is to continually fine-tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m20s)
00:31:20

[where it's at so far you know we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m24s)
00:31:24

[learned quite a few times now that these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m27s)
00:31:27

[identity blocks basically they map to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m29s)
00:31:29

[the residual so they keep trying to kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m32s)
00:31:32

[of fine tune the types of features that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m34s)
00:31:34

[we have so far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m37s)
00:31:37

[where else these bottlenecks blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m38s)
00:31:38

[actually force it from time to time to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m40s)
00:31:40

[kind of create a whole different types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m43s)
00:31:43

[of features and because there is no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m45s)
00:31:45

[identity passed through here and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m47s)
00:31:47

[shortest path still goes through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m50s)
00:31:50

[single convolution so when you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m51s)
00:31:51

[about transfer learning from ResNet you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m55s)
00:31:55

[kind of need to think about ok should I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m57s)
00:31:57

[transfer learn from identity blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h31m59s)
00:31:59

[before or after or from a bottleneck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m01s)
00:32:01

[block before or after again I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m04s)
00:32:04

[think anybody's studied this or at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m08s)
00:32:08

[I haven't seen anybody write it down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m11s)
00:32:11

[I've played around a little bit and I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m12s)
00:32:12

[not sure I have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m14s)
00:32:14

[totally decisive suggestion for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m17s)
00:32:17

[clearly my guess is that the best point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m20s)
00:32:20

[to grab in ResNet is the block at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m28s)
00:32:28

[end of the blocks immediately before a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[bottle net block and the reason for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m34s)
00:32:34

[is that at that level of kind of but at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m37s)
00:32:37

[that level of receptive field obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m40s)
00:32:40

[because each bottleneck block is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m42s)
00:32:42

[changing the receptive field so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m43s)
00:32:43

[level of receptive field and at that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m45s)
00:32:45

[level of kind of semantic complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m47s)
00:32:47

[this is the most sophisticated version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m49s)
00:32:49

[of it because it's been through a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m52s)
00:32:52

[bunch of identity blocks to get there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m54s)
00:32:54

[that gradually finds you in fine tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m55s)
00:32:55

[fine tune button times you and fine tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h32m57s)
00:32:57

[fine tune bottlenecks so my belief is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m00s)
00:33:00

[that you want to get just before that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m03s)
00:33:03

[bottleneck is the best place to transfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m05s)
00:33:05

[learning from so that's what it is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m09s)
00:33:09

[is the spot just before the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[bottleneck layer in ResNet so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m18s)
00:33:18

[pretty late and so as we know very well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m22s)
00:33:22

[from plat one with transfer learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m26s)
00:33:26

[when you're doing something which is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m28s)
00:33:28

[too different and in this case we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m30s)
00:33:30

[switching from one fighting coding to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m32s)
00:33:32

[work vectors which is not too different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m33s)
00:33:33

[you probably don't want to transfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m35s)
00:33:35

[learn from too early okay so that's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m38s)
00:33:38

[I've picked this fairly late stage which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m41s)
00:33:41

[is the just before the final bottleneck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m43s)
00:33:43

[block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m47s)
00:33:47

[okay so the second complexity here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m49s)
00:33:49

[that this bottleneck block has these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m53s)
00:33:53

[dimensions the output is 14 by 14 by 102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h33m56s)
00:33:56

[4 so we have about a million images so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m00s)
00:34:00

[million by 14 by 14 by 102 4 is more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m04s)
00:34:04

[than I wanted to deal with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m08s)
00:34:08

[so I did something very simple which was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m12s)
00:34:12

[I popped in one more layer after this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m16s)
00:34:16

[which is an average cooling layer seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m20s)
00:34:20

[by seven so that's going to take my 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m23s)
00:34:23

[by 14 output and turn it into a two by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m26s)
00:34:26

[two output all right so let's say one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m30s)
00:34:30

[those activations was looking for thirds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m33s)
00:34:33

[eyeballs right then it's saying in each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m35s)
00:34:35

[of the 14 by 14 spots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m38s)
00:34:38

[how likely is that that this is a bird's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m39s)
00:34:39

[eye ball and so after this it's now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m41s)
00:34:41

[seeing in each of these four spots on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m44s)
00:34:44

[average how much were those cells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m47s)
00:34:47

[looking like bird's eye balls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m50s)
00:34:50

[this is losing information if I had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m55s)
00:34:55

[bigger SSD I had more time I wouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h34m58s)
00:34:58

[have done this but it's a good trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m03s)
00:35:03

[right when you're working with these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m04s)
00:35:04

[fully convolutional architectures you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m06s)
00:35:06

[can pop an average cooling layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m09s)
00:35:09

[anywhere and decrease the resolution to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m10s)
00:35:10

[something that you feel like you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m13s)
00:35:13

[deal with so in this case this was my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m15s)
00:35:15

[petition with to go to Dubai to buy one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m17s)
00:35:17

[or two four and we talked about by means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m20s)
00:35:20

[of merge operation into many more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m27s)
00:35:27

[complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m29s)
00:35:29

[we have our assignments which which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m31s)
00:35:31

[basically that the merge with the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m33s)
00:35:33

[which does the plus yet that's the trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m35s)
00:35:35

[to making it into a ResNet block is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m40s)
00:35:40

[having the addition of the identity with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[the result when you have accomplished](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m46s)
00:35:46

[so uh recently I was trying to go from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m55s)
00:35:55

[many filters so he kind of stopped going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h35m58s)
00:35:58

[down finding the time Jennifer yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m00s)
00:36:00

[they're good best practice ongoing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m03s)
00:36:03

[problem appeal I 512 filters down to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m06s)
00:36:06

[labs just as simple as doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m08s)
00:36:08

[accomplishing with less filters yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m10s)
00:36:10

[there's not exactly a as I exactly that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m18s)
00:36:18

[after selects but and I think every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m22s)
00:36:22

[single successful architecture did she's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m26s)
00:36:26

[on in class about that every one of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m29s)
00:36:29

[eventually had to end up with you know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[thousand categories if it's an edge or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m34s)
00:36:34

[trade channels of most 255 continuous if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m37s)
00:36:37

[it's generative so the best things you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m41s)
00:36:41

[can really do is legitimate kind of move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m44s)
00:36:44

[into successful exceptions I don't think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m48s)
00:36:48

[it's all completed kind of a last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m50s)
00:36:50

[where maybe I'll be looking at images I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m52s)
00:36:52

[admitted briefly next week open with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m54s)
00:36:54

[quick run through some of the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h36m57s)
00:36:57

[that you could go back to a lot more a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m00s)
00:37:00

[monofin is going to be a paper attach a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m01s)
00:37:01

[different papers which have like best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m04s)
00:37:04

[practices you know really nice kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m06s)
00:37:06

[descriptions we did need hundreds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m09s)
00:37:09

[things these monitor results but all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m10s)
00:37:10

[this stuff it's still pretty young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m14s)
00:37:14

[a biro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m19s)
00:37:19

[good question so from a society which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m25s)
00:37:25

[institutions for interment support and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m28s)
00:37:28

[that ended up being a bit because there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m31s)
00:37:31

[again so complex life beauty even worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m33s)
00:37:33

[the native community ministry yes so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m37s)
00:37:37

[compressed and uncompressed it's like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m43s)
00:37:43

[couple hundred gig yeah but you won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m46s)
00:37:46

[you feel others injuries like why not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m48s)
00:37:48

[going to learn it memory you know states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m51s)
00:37:51

[all you describe employees a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[we're getting there yeah so so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m55s)
00:37:55

[exactly the right segue I was looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h37m59s)
00:37:59

[for so thank you so what we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m01s)
00:38:01

[do now is we want to run this model we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m04s)
00:38:04

[just built just just called basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[dot project on it and save the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m09s)
00:38:09

[predictions and the problem is that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m11s)
00:38:11

[size of those predictions is going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m14s)
00:38:14

[bigger than the amount of RAM I have so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m16s)
00:38:16

[I need to do with a batch at a time and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m18s)
00:38:18

[save it a batch of times they've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[million things each one with this many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m22s)
00:38:22

[activations so and this was going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[happen quite often right you're either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m29s)
00:38:29

[working on a smaller computer or you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m31s)
00:38:31

[working with a bigger data set or you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m33s)
00:38:33

[working with the data set where you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m34s)
00:38:34

[using a larger number of activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m36s)
00:38:36

[this is actually very easy to handle you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m39s)
00:38:39

[just create your big holes array where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m42s)
00:38:42

[you're going to store it and then all I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m45s)
00:38:45

[do is I go through from 0 to the length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m48s)
00:38:48

[of my array my saucer a a batch at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m53s)
00:38:53

[time right so this is creating the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m57s)
00:38:57

[numbers 0 0 plus 128 128 plus 128 so on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h38m58s)
00:38:58

[and so forth and then I take the slice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m04s)
00:39:04

[with my source array from originally 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m07s)
00:39:07

[to 128 and 128 256 and so forth so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m10s)
00:39:10

[is now going to contain a slice of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m15s)
00:39:15

[source equals array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m18s)
00:39:18

[and then well actually this is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m22s)
00:39:22

[create a generator which is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m25s)
00:39:25

[have all of those slices and of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m27s)
00:39:27

[being a generator it's going to be lazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m29s)
00:39:29

[so I can then enumerate through each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m31s)
00:39:31

[those slices and I can depend my big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m34s)
00:39:34

[holes array the result of predicting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m37s)
00:39:37

[just on that one batch okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m40s)
00:39:40

[so you've seen like predict and evaluate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m44s)
00:39:44

[and and fit and so forth and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m49s)
00:39:49

[generator versions also in carest is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m53s)
00:39:53

[generally an on batch version so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m57s)
00:39:57

[a train on batch and they predict on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h39m59s)
00:39:59

[batch and what these do is they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m01s)
00:40:01

[basically they have no smarts to them at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m03s)
00:40:03

[all this is like the most basic thing so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m06s)
00:40:06

[this is just going to take whatever you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m08s)
00:40:08

[give it and call predict on this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m09s)
00:40:09

[it won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m12s)
00:40:12

[shuffle that they want that shirt it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m12s)
00:40:12

[just going to throw it directly into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m14s)
00:40:14

[computation graph got a call predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m17s)
00:40:17

[adjust this batch of data and then from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m21s)
00:40:21

[time to time I print out how far I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m25s)
00:40:25

[got just so that I know how I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m28s)
00:40:28

[also from time to time I called flash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[that's the thing in big holes that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[actually writes it to disk after this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m34s)
00:40:34

[make sure that's continuously written to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m37s)
00:40:37

[disk so this thing doesn't actually take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m39s)
00:40:39

[very long to run and one of the nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m41s)
00:40:41

[things they can do here is I can do some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m44s)
00:40:44

[data augmentation as well so I've added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[a direction parameter and what I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m48s)
00:40:48

[to do is I'm going to have a second copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m51s)
00:40:51

[of all of my images which is clipped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m53s)
00:40:53

[horizontally so to flip things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h40m56s)
00:40:56

[horizontally that's interesting I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m00s)
00:41:00

[I screwed this up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m03s)
00:41:03

[should be here to flip things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m08s)
00:41:08

[horizontally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m10s)
00:41:10

[you've got batch height and then yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m15s)
00:41:15

[this is columns so this is the thing if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m19s)
00:41:19

[we pass in a minus 1 here then it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m22s)
00:41:22

[going to flip it horizontally that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m25s)
00:41:25

[explains what some of my results haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m31s)
00:41:31

[been quite as good as I hoped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m32s)
00:41:32

[okay so when you run this we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m33s)
00:41:33

[end up with a big big holes array that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m38s)
00:41:38

[going to contain two copies of every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m41s)
00:41:41

[resized image net image the activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m43s)
00:41:43

[at the layer that we one layer before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m47s)
00:41:47

[this so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m51s)
00:41:51

[all at once with Direction forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m55s)
00:41:55

[someone runs direction backwards and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m56s)
00:41:56

[at the end of that I've now got nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h41m59s)
00:41:59

[two million images or activations of two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m01s)
00:42:01

[by two by one or two four okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m04s)
00:42:04

[okay so that'd be pretty close to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m12s)
00:42:12

[end of ResNet I then just copied and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m17s)
00:42:17

[pasted from the terrace code the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m19s)
00:42:19

[few sets of ResNet right so this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m22s)
00:42:22

[last few blocks I added in one extra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m25s)
00:42:25

[identity block just because I had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[feeling that might help things along a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m30s)
00:42:30

[little bit again people have not really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m32s)
00:42:32

[studied this yet so I I haven't had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m34s)
00:42:34

[chance to properly experiment but it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m37s)
00:42:37

[seemed to work quite well so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m39s)
00:42:39

[basically copied and pasted from Chaos's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m42s)
00:42:42

[code I then need to copy and copy the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m44s)
00:42:44

[weights and care us for those last few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m47s)
00:42:47

[layers of ResNet and so now I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m50s)
00:42:50

[repeat the same process again which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m52s)
00:42:52

[to call predict on these last few layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m54s)
00:42:54

[and the input will be the output from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h42m58s)
00:42:58

[the previous one okay so we went like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m01s)
00:43:01

[two-thirds of the way into reg net and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m04s)
00:43:04

[got those activations and put those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m06s)
00:43:06

[activations into the last few stages of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m08s)
00:43:08

[ResNet to get those activations now the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[outputs from this are actually just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m14s)
00:43:14

[vector of length two or four eight which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m19s)
00:43:19

[does fit in my RAM so I didn't bother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[with calling predict on batch I can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[call doctored it if you try this at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m27s)
00:43:27

[and you don't have enough memory you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m30s)
00:43:30

[use the predict on batch trick again so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m32s)
00:43:32

[you know anytime you ran out of memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m35s)
00:43:35

[when calling predict you can always just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m38s)
00:43:38

[use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m41s)
00:43:41

[this time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m42s)
00:43:42

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[so at the end of all that I've now got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m47s)
00:43:47

[the activations from the penultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m49s)
00:43:49

[layer of Brezhnev and so I can do our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m53s)
00:43:53

[usual transfer learning trick of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m57s)
00:43:57

[creating a linear model and my linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h43m58s)
00:43:58

[model is now going to try to use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m04s)
00:44:04

[number of dimensions in my work vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m08s)
00:44:08

[at the output and you'll see it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[have any activation function that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[because I'm not doing one hot encoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m16s)
00:44:16

[my work batches could be any size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m19s)
00:44:19

[numbers so I'll just leave it as linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m21s)
00:44:21

[and then I compile it and then I fit it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m23s)
00:44:23

[and so this linear model is now my very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m27s)
00:44:27

[first this is you know this is almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m31s)
00:44:31

[the same as what we did in Lesson one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m33s)
00:44:33

[you know cryptographers cares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m34s)
00:44:34

[we're fine-tuning a model to a slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m37s)
00:44:37

[different objective functions one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m40s)
00:44:40

[slightly different target to what it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m42s)
00:44:42

[originally trained with it's just that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m46s)
00:44:46

[we're doing it with a lot more data so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m48s)
00:44:48

[we have to be a bit more thoughtful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m50s)
00:44:50

[there's one other difference here which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m53s)
00:44:53

[is I'm using a custom loss function and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[the last function I'm using is cosine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[distance you can lock that up at home if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m00s)
00:45:00

[you're not familiar with it but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m04s)
00:45:04

[basically cosine distance says for these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m05s)
00:45:05

[two points in space what's their angle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m08s)
00:45:08

[between them rather than how far away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m10s)
00:45:10

[are they the reason we're doing that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m12s)
00:45:12

[because we're about to start using K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m14s)
00:45:14

[nearest neighbors the K dearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m17s)
00:45:17

[neighbors are going to basically say oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m18s)
00:45:18

[here's a words actually predicted which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m20s)
00:45:20

[is the work vector which is closest to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m22s)
00:45:22

[it it turns out that in really really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m25s)
00:45:25

[high dimensional space the concept of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m28s)
00:45:28

[how far away something is is nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m30s)
00:45:30

[meaningless and the reason why is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m33s)
00:45:33

[in really really high dimensional space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m35s)
00:45:35

[everything chips on the edge of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m37s)
00:45:37

[space some basically because you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m40s)
00:45:40

[imagine like as you add each additional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m44s)
00:45:44

[dimension the probability that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m46s)
00:45:46

[something's on the edge in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m47s)
00:45:47

[dimension you know let's say the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m49s)
00:45:49

[probabilities too bright on the edge is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m51s)
00:45:51

[like 110 then if you're going to go one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m53s)
00:45:53

[dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m55s)
00:45:55

[you've got to probably have 110 it's on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m56s)
00:45:56

[the edge in one dimension or two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m58s)
00:45:58

[dimensions it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h45m59s)
00:45:59

[there are basically multiplicatively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m01s)
00:46:01

[decreasing the probability that that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m03s)
00:46:03

[happens so in a 300 dimensional space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m05s)
00:46:05

[everything is on the edge and when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m08s)
00:46:08

[everything's on the edge everything is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m10s)
00:46:10

[kind of an equal distance away from each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m12s)
00:46:12

[other more or less and so distances are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m15s)
00:46:15

[very helpful but the angle between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[things your barriers so when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m19s)
00:46:19

[doing anything with trying to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m24s)
00:46:24

[nearest neighbors it's a really good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m26s)
00:46:26

[idea to Train things using cosine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m28s)
00:46:28

[distance and this is the formula for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m31s)
00:46:31

[cosine distance again this is one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m34s)
00:46:34

[these things where I'm skipping over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m38s)
00:46:38

[something that you'd probably spend a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m39s)
00:46:39

[week in undergrad studying there's heaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m41s)
00:46:41

[of information about cosine distance on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m45s)
00:46:45

[the web so those of you already familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m46s)
00:46:46

[with it I won't waste your time those of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m48s)
00:46:48

[you not it's a very very good idea to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m50s)
00:46:50

[become familiar with this and feel free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m54s)
00:46:54

[to ask on the forums if you find any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m56s)
00:46:56

[material that makes sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h46m58s)
00:46:58

[okay so we've fitted our linear model as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m00s)
00:47:00

[per usual we saved our weights and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m04s)
00:47:04

[can see how we're going so what we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m07s)
00:47:07

[got now is something where we can feed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m11s)
00:47:11

[in an image and it will spit out a word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m13s)
00:47:13

[vector but it's something that looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m16s)
00:47:16

[like a word vector it has the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m19s)
00:47:19

[dimensionality is a word vector but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m20s)
00:47:20

[very unlikely that it's going to be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[exact as one of our thousands target](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m25s)
00:47:25

[word vectors you know so if the word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m29s)
00:47:29

[vector for a part you know is this list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m32s)
00:47:32

[of 200 floats even if we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m35s)
00:47:35

[perfectly Pocky Pug we're not going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m38s)
00:47:38

[get that exact list of 2,000 floats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m40s)
00:47:40

[we'll have something that is similar and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m42s)
00:47:42

[when we say similar we probably mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m45s)
00:47:45

[that the cosine distance between the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m47s)
00:47:47

[perfect platonic plug and our Pug is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m49s)
00:47:49

[pretty small but that's why after we get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m52s)
00:47:52

[our our predictions we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h47m59s)
00:47:59

[you then have to use nearest neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[as a second step to basically say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m07s)
00:48:07

[for each of those predictions what are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m09s)
00:48:09

[the three work vectors that are closest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m11s)
00:48:11

[for that prediction so we can now take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m14s)
00:48:14

[those nearest neighbors and find out for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m19s)
00:48:19

[our you know a bunch of our images what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m21s)
00:48:21

[are the three things that thinks it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m25s)
00:48:25

[might be so for example for this image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m26s)
00:48:26

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m29s)
00:48:29

[it's best guess with trombone next with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m31s)
00:48:31

[flute and third with cello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m34s)
00:48:34

[this gives us some hope that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m37s)
00:48:37

[approach seems to be working okay it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m39s)
00:48:39

[not great yet but it's recognize these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m42s)
00:48:42

[things the musical instruments and its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m44s)
00:48:44

[third guess was better correct mutual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m46s)
00:48:46

[instrument so we know what to do next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m48s)
00:48:48

[what we do next is to find three and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m50s)
00:48:50

[more layers and because we have already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m53s)
00:48:53

[saved the intermediate results from an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m55s)
00:48:55

[earlier layer and that fine-tuning is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h48m58s)
00:48:58

[going to be much faster to do two more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m00s)
00:49:00

[things I briefly mentioned one is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m05s)
00:49:05

[there's a couple of different ways to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m07s)
00:49:07

[nearest neighbors one is what's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m09s)
00:49:09

[the brute-force approach which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m10s)
00:49:10

[literally okay what's the what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m12s)
00:49:12

[nearest word vector to this word vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m15s)
00:49:15

[I'd like to go through every one and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m17s)
00:49:17

[how far away it is there's another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m19s)
00:49:19

[approach which is approximate nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m21s)
00:49:21

[neighbors and when you've got lots and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m24s)
00:49:24

[lots of things you're trying to look for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m27s)
00:49:27

[nearest neighbors the brute-force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m28s)
00:49:28

[approach is going to be N squared time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m31s)
00:49:31

[it's going to be two this way where else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m34s)
00:49:34

[would approximate nearest neighbors are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m36s)
00:49:36

[generally n log n time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m38s)
00:49:38

[so orders of magnitude faster if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m41s)
00:49:41

[got a large data set the particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m44s)
00:49:44

[approach I'm using here is an encoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m48s)
00:49:48

[locality-sensitive hashing it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m50s)
00:49:50

[fascinating and wonderful algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[anybody who's interested in algorithms I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[strongly recommend you go read about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h49m57s)
00:49:57

[let me know if you need a hand with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m00s)
00:50:00

[my favorite kind of algorithms are these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[approximate approximate algorithms like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m07s)
00:50:07

[in data science you almost never need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m10s)
00:50:10

[know something exactly yet nearly every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m13s)
00:50:13

[algorithm that people learn at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m15s)
00:50:15

[University and certainly at high school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m17s)
00:50:17

[are exact we learn exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m19s)
00:50:19

[nearest-neighbor algorithms and exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[indexing algorithms and exact median](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[algorithms pretty much for every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m25s)
00:50:25

[algorithm out there there's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m27s)
00:50:27

[approximate version that runs you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m29s)
00:50:29

[an order of n or log n over n faster so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[and one of the cool things is that once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m36s)
00:50:36

[you start realizing that you suddenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m38s)
00:50:38

[discover that all of the libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m40s)
00:50:40

[you've been using for ages were written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m41s)
00:50:41

[by people that didn't know this and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m43s)
00:50:43

[you realize that like every sub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m46s)
00:50:46

[algorithm they've written they could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[have used naproxen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m49s)
00:50:49

[version next thing you've got know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m50s)
00:50:50

[something it runs a thousand times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[faster the other cool thing about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m53s)
00:50:53

[approximate algorithms is that they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m55s)
00:50:55

[generally written to provably be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h50m58s)
00:50:58

[accurate to within so close and like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m00s)
00:51:00

[can tell you with your parameters how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m03s)
00:51:03

[close they're so close which means that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m05s)
00:51:05

[if you want to make it more accurate we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m07s)
00:51:07

[run it more times there's like different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m10s)
00:51:10

[random feeds and so this thing called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[LSH forest is a locality sensitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m14s)
00:51:14

[hashing forest which means it creates a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m17s)
00:51:17

[bunch of these locality sensitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[hashing and the amazingly great thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m22s)
00:51:22

[about approximate algorithms is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m24s)
00:51:24

[each time you create another version of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m26s)
00:51:26

[it you're exponentially increasing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m28s)
00:51:28

[accuracy or multiplicatively increasing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m31s)
00:51:31

[the accuracy but only linearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m34s)
00:51:34

[increasing the time right so if the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m36s)
00:51:36

[error on one fall of LSH was eight then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m39s)
00:51:39

[the error of two calls is one - each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m45s)
00:51:45

[grade in three calls is 1 minus e cubed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m49s)
00:51:49

[and the time you're taking though the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m52s)
00:51:52

[time for one call was n is now 2 n 3 n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m54s)
00:51:54

[so when you've got something where you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m57s)
00:51:57

[can make it as accurate as you like with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h51m59s)
00:51:59

[only linear increase in time this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m03s)
00:52:03

[incredibly powerful so this is a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m05s)
00:52:05

[approximation algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m08s)
00:52:08

[had more time I'd love to tell you all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m11s)
00:52:11

[about it so I generally used LSH forests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m13s)
00:52:13

[when I'm doing nearest news because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m18s)
00:52:18

[arbitrarily closed and much faster when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m20s)
00:52:20

[you publish words work vectors the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m23s)
00:52:23

[reason that they place the time that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m26s)
00:52:26

[becomes important is when I move beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m27s)
00:52:27

[image net which I'm going to do now so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m31s)
00:52:31

[let's say I got a picture and I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m34s)
00:52:34

[just want to say which one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m38s)
00:52:38

[thousand image net categories is it it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m40s)
00:52:40

[which one of the hundred thousand word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m42s)
00:52:42

[net nouns is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m45s)
00:52:45

[that's much harder thing to do okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m47s)
00:52:47

[that's something that no previous model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m50s)
00:52:50

[could do right when you trained an image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m52s)
00:52:52

[net model the only thing you could do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m55s)
00:52:55

[recognize pictures of things that were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m57s)
00:52:57

[image net but now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h52m58s)
00:52:58

[we've got a word sector model and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m02s)
00:53:02

[can put in an image that spits out a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m04s)
00:53:04

[word vector and that word vector could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m07s)
00:53:07

[be closer to things that are not an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m09s)
00:53:09

[image net at all or it could be a some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m10s)
00:53:10

[higher level of the hierarchy so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[could look for a dog rather than a park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m16s)
00:53:16

[or a plane rather than a 747 so here we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m18s)
00:53:18

[bring in the entire set of work vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m25s)
00:53:25

[and I have to remember to share these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m28s)
00:53:28

[with you because these are actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m30s)
00:53:30

[quite hard to create and this is where I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m31s)
00:53:31

[definitely want LSH forest because this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m35s)
00:53:35

[is very pretty slow and we can now do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m37s)
00:53:37

[the same thing and not surprisingly it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m41s)
00:53:41

[got works right the thing that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m44s)
00:53:44

[actually cello that now cellos not even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m45s)
00:53:45

[in the top three and so this is a harder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m47s)
00:53:47

[problem so let's try fine-tuning so fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m50s)
00:53:50

[tuning is the final trick I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m55s)
00:53:55

[show you are just behind your ritual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h53m58s)
00:53:58

[just to clarify what you were getting up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m03s)
00:54:03

[there we sing all over veterans Lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m05s)
00:54:05

[everywhere in English language yeah yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m07s)
00:54:07

[you Mike remember last week we looked at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m11s)
00:54:11

[creating our word vectors and what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m13s)
00:54:13

[did was we actually I created a list I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m17s)
00:54:17

[went to word net and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m24s)
00:54:24

[yeah our website worth net and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m28s)
00:54:28

[downloaded the whole of work net and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m30s)
00:54:30

[then I pick it out which team for nouns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m32s)
00:54:32

[and then I use the rich expertise out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m35s)
00:54:35

[those and then I saved that so yeah we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m37s)
00:54:37

[actually have the entirety of work net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m39s)
00:54:39

[nouns like children your limoncello not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m45s)
00:54:45

[close to it because it's because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m48s)
00:54:48

[not a good enough model yet alright so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m52s)
00:54:52

[now that there's 80,000 nouns there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m54s)
00:54:54

[lot more a lot more ways to be wrong all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h54m58s)
00:54:58

[right so what it only has to say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m01s)
00:55:01

[which of these thousand things is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m03s)
00:55:03

[that's pretty easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m04s)
00:55:04

[which of these 80,000 things is it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m06s)
00:55:06

[pretty hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m08s)
00:55:08

[okay sure you want to take that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m10s)
00:55:10

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m13s)
00:55:13

[okay so to fine-tune it it looks very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m15s)
00:55:15

[similar to our usual way of fine-tuning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m20s)
00:55:20

[things which is that we take our two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m21s)
00:55:21

[models and stick them back to back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m26s)
00:55:26

[and we're now going to train the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m31s)
00:55:31

[thing rather than just the linear model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m34s)
00:55:34

[now the problem is that the input to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m36s)
00:55:36

[this model is too big to fit in round so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m40s)
00:55:40

[how are we going to call fit or fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m45s)
00:55:45

[generator when we have an array data too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[big to fit in RAM well one obvious thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[to do would USB to past in the big holes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m55s)
00:55:55

[array because to most things in place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h55m57s)
00:55:57

[than a big holes array looks just like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m00s)
00:56:00

[regular array doesn't really look any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m02s)
00:56:02

[different the way a big holes array is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m04s)
00:56:04

[actually stored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m09s)
00:56:09

[is it actually stored as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m12s)
00:56:12

[yeah a big holes array is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m17s)
00:56:17

[stored in a directory as I'm sure you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m19s)
00:56:19

[noticed and in that directory that takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m21s)
00:56:21

[got something that called chunk length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m25s)
00:56:25

[and plan actually I set it to 32 when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m29s)
00:56:29

[created these big holes arrays what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m35s)
00:56:35

[does is it takes every 32 images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m37s)
00:56:37

[puts them into a separate file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m42s)
00:56:42

[all right so each one of these has 32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m45s)
00:56:45

[images in it or 32 of the leading of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m49s)
00:56:49

[leading axis of the array now if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m55s)
00:56:55

[then try to take this whole array and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h56m59s)
00:56:59

[passed it to dot set and care us with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m02s)
00:57:02

[shuffle it's going to try and grab one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m07s)
00:57:07

[thing from here and one thing from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m10s)
00:57:10

[and there one thing from here here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m12s)
00:57:12

[bad news but they call to park get one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m14s)
00:57:14

[thing out of a chunk it has to read and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m17s)
00:57:17

[decompress the whole thing as it has to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m20s)
00:57:20

[read and decompress 32 images in order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m23s)
00:57:23

[to give you the one image you asked for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m25s)
00:57:25

[at B as a buzzer and that be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m27s)
00:57:27

[ridiculously horribly slow we didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m29s)
00:57:29

[have to worry about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m33s)
00:57:33

[when we called predict on batch because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m34s)
00:57:34

[we were grab it we were going not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m38s)
00:57:38

[shuffling but we were going in order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m40s)
00:57:40

[that was just grabbing one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m42s)
00:57:42

[grabbing a single image out of the out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[of a chunk but now that we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m53s)
00:57:53

[shuffle it would right so what we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h57m55s)
00:57:55

[done is we've somebody very helpfully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m00s)
00:58:00

[actually on a cattle forum provided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m04s)
00:58:04

[something called a be called array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m06s)
00:58:06

[iterator and the be called array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m08s)
00:58:08

[iterator which was kindly discovered on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m11s)
00:58:11

[the forums actually by somebody named NP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m17s)
00:58:17

[Johnston originally written by this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m20s)
00:58:20

[fellow what it does is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m23s)
00:58:23

[provides a Karass compatible generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m31s)
00:58:31

[which grabs an entire chunk at a time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m35s)
00:58:35

[it's a little bit less random right but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m40s)
00:58:40

[given that if this has got two million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m43s)
00:58:43

[images in and the chunk length is 32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m45s)
00:58:45

[then it's going to basically create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[batch of chunks rather than a batch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m50s)
00:58:50

[images and so that means we have none of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m54s)
00:58:54

[the performance problems and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m57s)
00:58:57

[particularly because we remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h58m59s)
00:58:59

[originally we randomly shuffled our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m01s)
00:59:01

[files so this whole thing is randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m03s)
00:59:03

[shuffled anyway and so this is a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m05s)
00:59:05

[trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m08s)
00:59:08

[so you'll find the big holes array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[iterator on github feel free to take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m12s)
00:59:12

[look at the code it's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m15s)
00:59:15

[straightforward there was a few issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m17s)
00:59:17

[with the original version so NP Jensen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m22s)
00:59:22

[life kind of tried to fix it up and I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m26s)
00:59:26

[written some tests for us and he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m27s)
00:59:27

[written some documentation for it but if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m29s)
00:59:29

[you just want to use it then it's as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m32s)
00:59:32

[simple as writing this wire equals big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[holes array iterator this is your data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m38s)
00:59:38

[your labels couple equals true batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m42s)
00:59:42

[size equals whatever and then you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m46s)
00:59:46

[just call fit generator as per usual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m48s)
00:59:48

[nothing in that iterator and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m49s)
00:59:49

[iterators number of items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m53s)
00:59:53

[okay so all of you guys who have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m57s)
00:59:57

[asking you know how do I deal with data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=00h59m59s)
00:59:59

[that's bigger than memory this is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m02s)
01:00:02

[you do it okay so hopefully that will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m06s)
01:00:06

[make life easier for other people so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m10s)
01:00:10

[fine-tune it for a while we do some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m14s)
01:00:14

[loading repre kneeling for a while and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m16s)
01:00:16

[this basically runs overnight for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m19s)
01:00:19

[kind of takes about six hours to run and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m23s)
01:00:23

[so come back the next morning and I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m27s)
01:00:27

[copy and paste my K nearest neighbors so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m30s)
01:00:30

[I call predict to get my predicted work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m33s)
01:00:33

[vectors for each word vector R then pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m35s)
01:00:35

[it into nearest neighbors this is my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m40s)
01:00:40

[gist thousand categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m41s)
01:00:41

[and lo and behold we now have fellow in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m44s)
01:00:44

[the top spot as we hoped how did it go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m48s)
01:00:48

[in the heart a problem of looking at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m51s)
01:00:51

[100,000 or so now nouns in English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m53s)
01:00:53

[pretty good I've got this one right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m55s)
01:00:55

[just to pick another one at random let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h00m58s)
01:00:58

[pick the first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m01s)

[it said thrown that sure looks like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m02s)
01:01:02

[throne so looking pretty good so here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m05s)
01:01:05

[something interesting now that we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m09s)
01:01:09

[bought images and words into the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m11s)

[space let's play with it some more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m14s)
01:01:14

[so why don't we use nearest neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m18s)
01:01:18

[with those predictions so predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m21s)

[argument boom boom what there's work yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m30s)
01:01:30

[so to to the to the word Tyvek vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m36s)
01:01:36

[which Google created and but the subset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m41s)
01:01:41

[of those which are nouns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m46s)
01:01:46

[according to word net maps - there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m48s)
01:01:48

[ten set IDs both zu several know dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m51s)
01:01:51

[so yeah the word well the word vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h01m58s)
01:01:58

[are just the word to word two vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m00s)
01:02:00

[that we can download off the internet so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m03s)
01:02:03

[yes they were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m04s)
01:02:04

[pre trained by Google please versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m05s)
01:02:05

[we like very beddings but they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m11s)
01:02:11

[really waste you're better than me I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m12s)

[gettin okay so Lincoln grew presumably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m15s)
01:02:15

[onwards which yes exactly so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m19s)
01:02:19

[saying here is this this image spits out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m23s)
01:02:23

[a vector from a thing we just trained we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m28s)
01:02:28

[have a hundred thousand word to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m32s)
01:02:32

[word vectors for all the nouns in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m35s)
01:02:35

[English which one of those is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m37s)
01:02:37

[closest to the thing that came out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m40s)
01:02:40

[our model and the answer was from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m42s)
01:02:42

[zoo in localization user excusive long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m46s)
01:02:46

[nourishment space hold that thought will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m51s)
01:02:51

[be doing language translation starting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m55s)
01:02:55

[next week so no we don't quite do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[that way but you can think of it much um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m00s)
01:03:00

[so let's do something interesting let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[um create a nearest neighbors not for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m04s)
01:03:04

[all of the work of X Factor's but for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[all of our image predicted vectors and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m12s)
01:03:12

[now we can do the opposite let's take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m15s)
01:03:15

[word we pick at random let's look it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m17s)
01:03:17

[in our work to veterinary and let's find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[the nearest neighbors for that in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m23s)
01:03:23

[images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m27s)
01:03:27

[there it is okay so this is pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m31s)
01:03:31

[interesting you know you could now find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m35s)
01:03:35

[there's a touch-free right so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m37s)
01:03:37

[now find the images that are the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m39s)
01:03:39

[like whatever words you come up with so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m42s)
01:03:42

[okay that's crazy but we can do crazier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[here is a random thing I picked now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m49s)
01:03:49

[notice I picked it from the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m51s)
01:03:51

[set of image nets we've never seen this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m53s)
01:03:53

[image before and when honestly when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m55s)
01:03:55

[opened it up my heart sank because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m57s)
01:03:57

[don't know what it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h03m59s)
01:03:59

[so this is a problem what is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m01s)
01:04:01

[Riesling manta ray okay so I didn't pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m06s)
01:04:06

[it so what we can do is we can call drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m09s)
01:04:09

[predict on that image and we can then do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m12s)
01:04:12

[a nearest neighbors of all of our other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m15s)
01:04:15

[images and there's the first there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m17s)
01:04:17

[second and the third one is even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m22s)
01:04:22

[somebody putting their hand on it which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m24s)
01:04:24

[is slightly crazy but that was what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[original one for play in fact I've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[if I can find it at this one I ran it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m34s)
01:04:34

[again on a different image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m40s)
01:04:40

[yeah here okay I took this one which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m46s)
01:04:46

[like pretty I actually looked around for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m51s)
01:04:51

[something weird this is pretty weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m53s)
01:04:53

[right this is the natural is it a fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m54s)
01:04:54

[so when we then ask for nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m56s)
01:04:56

[neighbors we get fish in there okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h04m58s)
01:04:58

[it's like I don't know sometimes deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m03s)
01:05:03

[learning so magic you just kind of go in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m06s)
01:05:06

[there possibly what ads this behind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m07s)
01:05:07

[Rachel I don't assistant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m10s)
01:05:10

[we try to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m14s)
01:05:14

[Catherine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m18s)
01:05:18

[Oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m20s)
01:05:20

[yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m22s)
01:05:22

[yeah I'm only a little bit and maybe you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m24s)
01:05:24

[know future course we model cadets go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[thinking maybe even in your numerical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m31s)
01:05:31

[linear algebra course you might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m34s)
01:05:34

[looking a desk so I don't think we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m35s)
01:05:35

[cover it this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m37s)
01:05:37

[um but do look at that dask it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m40s)
01:05:40

[difficult to show our problem issue in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m42s)
01:05:42

[training there and if they have easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m49s)
01:05:49

[using them and fish no not at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[so these were actually labeled as this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m55s)
01:05:55

[particular kind of fish in fact that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h05m59s)
01:05:59

[the other thing is it's not only found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m01s)
01:06:01

[fishing nets it has actually found this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m03s)
01:06:03

[more or less the same breed of fish in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m05s)
01:06:05

[the net but when we called predict on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m07s)
01:06:07

[those it created a word vector which was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m14s)
01:06:14

[probably like halfway between that kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m19s)
01:06:19

[of fish and a net because it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m22s)
01:06:22

[know what to do right and so sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m27s)
01:06:27

[when it see things like that there would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m29s)
01:06:29

[have been mark seen image net of the net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m30s)
01:06:30

[and sometimes it would have been a fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m32s)
01:06:32

[and so the best way to minimize the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m33s)
01:06:33

[function would have been to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m36s)
01:06:36

[pitch that's so attached and as a result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m38s)
01:06:38

[the images that were closest were the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m40s)
01:06:40

[ones which actually were half way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m42s)
01:06:42

[between the two themselves so it's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m44s)
01:06:44

[of a convenient accident all in in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m47s)
01:06:47

[alone in that evening a chance and be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m51s)
01:06:51

[willing network that an asset yeah yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m52s)
01:06:52

[absolutely yeah this up at the back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m55s)
01:06:55

[there we'll just walk it over it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h06m58s)
01:06:58

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m02s)
01:07:02

[the bridge network to length with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m05s)

[ring when you can't wear prison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m06s)
01:07:06

[you absolutely can and I have and but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m13s)
01:07:13

[really certain nearest neighbors I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m16s)
01:07:16

[haven't found anything nearly as good as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m17s)
01:07:17

[cosine and that's true and all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m19s)
01:07:19

[things I looked up as well by the way I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m22s)
01:07:22

[should mention the when you use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m25s)
01:07:25

[locality-sensitive hashing in Python by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m28s)
01:07:28

[default it uses something that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m30s)
01:07:30

[equivalent to the cosine metrics so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[that's why the nearest neighbors work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m34s)
01:07:34

[yes yes more than one yes exactly so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m38s)
01:07:38

[starting next week we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m45s)
01:07:45

[learning about sequence to sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m47s)
01:07:47

[models and memory and attention methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[they're going to show us how we can take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m52s)
01:07:52

[an input such as a sentence in English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m55s)
01:07:55

[and without input/output such as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m57s)
01:07:57

[sentence in French which is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[particular case study we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m01s)
01:08:01

[spending two or three weeks on when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m02s)
01:08:02

[combine that with this you get image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m05s)
01:08:05

[captioning I'm not sure if we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m07s)
01:08:07

[to have time to do it ourselves but it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m09s)
01:08:09

[will literally be trivial for you guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m12s)
01:08:12

[to take the two things and combine them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m15s)
01:08:15

[into image caching I could serve it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m18s)
01:08:18

[just those two techniques together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m20s)
01:08:20

[person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m21s)
01:08:21

[okay so we're now going to switch to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m24s)
01:08:24

[actually before we take a break I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m29s)
01:08:29

[to show you the homework and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m34s)
01:08:34

[homework hopefully you guys noticed I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m38s)
01:08:38

[gave you some tips because it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m41s)
01:08:41

[challenging one even though in a sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m42s)
01:08:42

[it was kind of straightforward which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m45s)
01:08:45

[would take everything that we've already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m47s)
01:08:47

[learned about different resolution and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m49s)
01:08:49

[slightly change the loss function so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m50s)
01:08:50

[that it does perceptual loss it's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m53s)
01:08:53

[cell transfer instead the details are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m54s)
01:08:54

[tricky and I'm going to quickly show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m56s)
01:08:56

[two things and the first we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h08m59s)
01:08:59

[show you how I did the homework if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m01s)
01:09:01

[actually hadn't done it last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m02s)
01:09:02

[luckily I have enough RAM that I could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m05s)
01:09:05

[read the two things all into memory so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m08s)
01:09:08

[don't forget you can just do that with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m09s)
01:09:09

[big holes array to turn it into a numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m11s)
01:09:11

[array in memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m13s)
01:09:13

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m15s)
01:09:15

[so one thing I did was I created my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m17s)
01:09:17

[upsampling block to get rid of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[checkerboard patterns that was literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m21s)
01:09:21

[as simple as saying upsampling 2d than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m23s)
01:09:23

[1x1 cotton so that got rid of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m25s)
01:09:25

[triangle layer a checkable times the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m29s)
01:09:29

[next thing I did was I changed my last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m34s)
01:09:34

[function and I decided before I try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m36s)
01:09:36

[do style transfer with perceptual losses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m39s)
01:09:39

[let's try and do super resolution with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m42s)
01:09:42

[multiple content last layers because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m45s)
01:09:45

[like that's one thing that I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[have to do is they'll transfer is be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m51s)
01:09:51

[able to use multiple layers so like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m52s)
01:09:52

[always like to start with something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m55s)
01:09:55

[works and make small little changes so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m56s)
01:09:56

[it keeps working at every point so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h09m59s)
01:09:59

[this case I thought okay let's first of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m01s)
01:10:01

[all slightly change the loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m05s)
01:10:05

[tour and took a resolution so that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m07s)
01:10:07

[uses multiple layers so here's how I did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m10s)
01:10:10

[that I changed my get output layer so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m13s)
01:10:13

[changed my PTT content so it created a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m18s)
01:10:18

[list of outputs climbs one from each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[the first second and third blocks okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m25s)
01:10:25

[and then I changed my loss function so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m27s)
01:10:27

[it went through and added the mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m32s)
01:10:32

[squared difference for each of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m35s)
01:10:35

[three layers I also just have to add a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m37s)
01:10:37

[weight just for fun so I decided what to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m40s)
01:10:40

[go point one point eight point one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m42s)
01:10:42

[because this is the layer that they used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m44s)
01:10:44

[in the paper but you know but let's have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m46s)
01:10:46

[a little bit of you know more precise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m49s)
01:10:49

[super resolution and a little bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m51s)
01:10:51

[more semantic sticker resolution see how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m53s)
01:10:53

[it goes I created it functioned to kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h10m55s)
01:10:55

[of a more general mean squared error and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m00s)
01:11:00

[that was basically it so other than that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m03s)
01:11:03

[line and that line everything else was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m06s)
01:11:06

[the same and so that gave me super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m09s)
01:11:09

[resolution working on multiple layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m11s)
01:11:11

[and one of the things I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[fascinating is that this is the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m16s)
01:11:16

[low res and it done a good job of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m20s)
01:11:20

[upscaling it but it's also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m23s)
01:11:23

[fixed up the weird white balance which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m25s)
01:11:25

[really surprised me right it's thinkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m27s)
01:11:27

[this obviously over yellow is shot and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m30s)
01:11:30

[this is what ceramic should look like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m33s)
01:11:33

[should be white you know and somehow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m35s)
01:11:35

[it's kind of adjusted everything so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m36s)
01:11:36

[30s or whatever it is in the background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m38s)
01:11:38

[has come from a Yowie Brown to a nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m40s)
01:11:40

[white as if these cast here I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[figure it out with these slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m45s)
01:11:45

[pixelated things they're actually meant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m46s)
01:11:46

[to be upside down handles now this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m48s)
01:11:48

[only 20,000 images so I I am very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m50s)
01:11:50

[surprised that it's fixing the color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m56s)
01:11:56

[because we never asked it to but I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h11m58s)
01:11:58

[it knows what a cut is meant to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m03s)
01:12:03

[like then so this is what it's decided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[to do is to make a up to where it thinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m08s)
01:12:08

[it's meant to look so that is pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m10s)
01:12:10

[cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m12s)
01:12:12

[so so then to go from there to style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m16s)
01:12:16

[transfer was pretty straightforward I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m20s)
01:12:20

[had to read in my style as before this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m22s)
01:12:22

[is the code to do their special kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m26s)
01:12:26

[ResNet block where we use valid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m28s)
01:12:28

[convolutions which means we lose two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m31s)
01:12:31

[pixels each time and so therefore we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m34s)
01:12:34

[have to do it Center crop I don't forget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m37s)
01:12:37

[lambda layers are great for this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m39s)
01:12:39

[thing right that's whatever you whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m41s)
01:12:41

[code you can write check it in a lambda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m43s)
01:12:43

[layer suddenly it's a chaos' layer so do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m45s)
01:12:45

[my Center crop so this is our resident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m47s)
01:12:47

[block which does well it comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m49s)
01:12:49

[so this is basically all exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m53s)
01:12:53

[same we have to do a few down samplings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m55s)
01:12:55

[and then the computation in our up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h12m59s)
01:12:59

[sampling just like a supplemental paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m00s)
01:13:00

[so the loss function looks a lot like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m04s)
01:13:04

[the loss function did before but we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m07s)
01:13:07

[got two extra things what is the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m10s)
01:13:10

[matrix so here is a version of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m11s)
01:13:11

[ground matrix which works a batch at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m15s)
01:13:15

[time now if any of you tried to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m17s)
01:13:17

[a single image at a time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m20s)
01:13:20

[you would have gone crazy with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m21s)
01:13:21

[slower talk I saw a few of you trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m22s)
01:13:22

[do that so here's the batch wise version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m24s)
01:13:24

[of Graham metrics and then the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m27s)
01:13:27

[thing I needed to do was somehow feed in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m30s)
01:13:30

[my style target okay so another thing I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m32s)
01:13:32

[thought some of you do was feed in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m35s)
01:13:35

[style target every time of feed in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m38s)
01:13:38

[array into your loss function now you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m44s)
01:13:44

[can obviously calculate your style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[target by just calling dot product right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m49s)
01:13:49

[with the thing which gives you your all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m53s)
01:13:53

[of your different style target layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m55s)
01:13:55

[but the problem is this thing here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m57s)
01:13:57

[returns an umpire rain it's a pretty big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h13m59s)
01:13:59

[number array which means that then when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m01s)
01:14:01

[you want to use it as a style target and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m04s)
01:14:04

[training it has to copy that back to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m06s)
01:14:06

[GPU and copying to the GPU is very very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m09s)
01:14:09

[very slow and this is a really big thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m13s)
01:14:13

[to copy to the GPU so any of you who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m15s)
01:14:15

[tries this and I saw some of you try it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m17s)
01:14:17

[took forever okay so here's the trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m18s)
01:14:18

[called variable art all right turning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m24s)
01:14:24

[something into a variable fix it on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m26s)
01:14:26

[GPU for you all right so once you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m29s)
01:14:29

[done that you can now treat this as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m32s)
01:14:32

[list of symbolic entities which are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m34s)
01:14:34

[GPU versions of this right so I can now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m38s)
01:14:38

[call this use this inside eye GPU code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m42s)
01:14:42

[so here my style targets I can use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m46s)
01:14:46

[inside my lost function there it is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m50s)
01:14:50

[can use inside my loss function and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m54s)
01:14:54

[doesn't have to do any copying passing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m57s)
01:14:57

[forward so there's a subtlety but if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h14m59s)
01:14:59

[don't get that subtlety right you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m02s)
01:15:02

[going to be waiting for a week or so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m04s)
01:15:04

[your code to finish so those are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m07s)
01:15:07

[little subtleties which were necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m10s)
01:15:10

[to get this to work and once you get it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m13s)
01:15:13

[to work it does exactly the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m15s)
01:15:15

[basically it before so where this gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m17s)
01:15:17

[combined with devise is I want to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m22s)
01:15:22

[something interesting which is in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m25s)
01:15:25

[original perceptual office paper they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m27s)
01:15:27

[trained it on on the cocoa data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m31s)
01:15:31

[which has 80,000 images which didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m34s)
01:15:34

[seem like many I wanted to know what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m37s)
01:15:37

[would happen if we trained it on all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m39s)
01:15:39

[imagenet so I did so I decided to train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m40s)
01:15:40

[a super resolution network on all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m47s)
01:15:47

[image net and a codes all identical so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m49s)
01:15:49

[I'm not going to explain it other than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m53s)
01:15:53

[you'll notice we don't have the square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m56s)
01:15:56

[bracket colon square bracket here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h15m59s)
01:15:59

[anymore all right because we don't want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m00s)
01:16:00

[to try and read in the entirety of image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m03s)
01:16:03

[net into RAM so these are still big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m04s)
01:16:04

[holes arrays and all the other code is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m06s)
01:16:06

[identical until we get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m09s)
01:16:09

[here so I use a be called array iterator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m14s)
01:16:14

[I can't just call dot fit because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m20s)
01:16:20

[that's it adopt it generator assumes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m27s)
01:16:27

[that your iterator is returning your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m31s)
01:16:31

[your data and your labels in our case we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m35s)
01:16:35

[don't have data and labels we have two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m39s)
01:16:39

[things that both get set in as two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m41s)
01:16:41

[inputs and our labels are just a list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m43s)
01:16:43

[zeros okay so here's a quick trick and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m46s)
01:16:46

[just this answers your earlier question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m50s)
01:16:50

[about how do you how do you do multi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m52s)
01:16:52

[input models on large data sets and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[answer is create your own training loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h16m58s)
01:16:58

[okay create your own training loop which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m01s)
01:17:01

[lives through a bunch of iterations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m04s)
01:17:04

[then you can grab as many batches of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m06s)
01:17:06

[data from as many different iterations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m10s)
01:17:10

[as you like and then call trained on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m11s)
01:17:11

[batch right so in my case I big holes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m14s)
01:17:14

[array iterator is going to return my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[high resolution and low resolution batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[of images so I go to a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[iterations grab one batch of high res](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m24s)
01:17:24

[and low res images and pass them as my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m26s)
01:17:26

[two inputs the Train on batch so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m30s)
01:17:30

[the only code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[I changed other than changing that fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[generator to actually calling back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m42s)
01:17:42

[so as you can see this took me four and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m47s)
01:17:47

[a half hours to train and I then it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m51s)
01:17:51

[creates learning rate and I trained for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[another four and a half hours actually I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[did it overnight last night I only had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h17m58s)
01:17:58

[enough time to do about half of imagenet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m00s)
01:18:00

[so this isn't even the whole thing but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m02s)
01:18:02

[check this out so check that model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m04s)
01:18:04

[we're going to call drop predict on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m07s)
01:18:07

[is the original high-res image here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m11s)
01:18:11

[the low res version and here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m16s)
01:18:16

[version that we've created and as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m20s)
01:18:20

[can see it's done a pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m22s)
01:18:22

[extraordinarily good job you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m24s)
01:18:24

[when you look at the original ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m26s)
01:18:26

[they'll just kind of a yellow thing here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m29s)
01:18:29

[it's kind of turned it into a nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m32s)
01:18:32

[little inscription you can see that her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m33s)
01:18:33

[eyes would like to grade Lots it's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m36s)
01:18:36

[of spin turn it into some eyes you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m39s)
01:18:39

[see that her you could just tell that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m43s)
01:18:43

[an a maybe if you look carefully now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m46s)
01:18:46

[it's very clearly an A so you can see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m48s)
01:18:48

[doesn't amazing job of upscaling this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m51s)
01:18:51

[Paul is still is this is a fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h18m57s)
01:18:57

[convolutional net and therefore is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m00s)
01:19:00

[specific to any particular input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m02s)
01:19:02

[resolution so what I can do is I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m03s)
01:19:03

[create another version of the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m06s)
01:19:06

[using our high risk as the input okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m10s)
01:19:10

[now we're going to call dot predicts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m14s)
01:19:14

[with the high-res input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m16s)
01:19:16

[and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m21s)
01:19:21

[but we get that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m23s)
01:19:23

[look at that we can now see all of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m25s)
01:19:25

[detail on the basketball which simply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m29s)
01:19:29

[none of that really existed here like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m35s)
01:19:35

[was there but pretty hard to see what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m37s)
01:19:37

[was okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m39s)
01:19:39

[and like look at before like look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m40s)
01:19:40

[over here right this kind of gray blob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m42s)
01:19:42

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m44s)
01:19:44

[here you can see it it knows it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m49s)
01:19:49

[little bit to pull back here so like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m52s)
01:19:52

[can take any size image and make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m56s)
01:19:56

[bigger and like this this to me is one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h19m59s)
01:19:59

[of the most amazing results I've seen in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m04s)
01:20:04

[deep learning when we train something on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m07s)
01:20:07

[nearly all of imagenet it's a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m09s)
01:20:09

[epoch so there's definitely no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m11s)
01:20:11

[overfitting and it's like able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m13s)
01:20:13

[recognize what hair is meant to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[like when pulled back into a bun it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m17s)
01:20:17

[pretty pretty extraordinary result I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[think something else which I only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m22s)
01:20:22

[realized later is that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m25s)
01:20:25

[it's all a bit fuzzy right I'd like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m31s)
01:20:31

[arm in the background for this fuzzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m34s)
01:20:34

[the model knows that that is meant to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m37s)
01:20:37

[stay fuzzy it knows what out-of-focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m40s)
01:20:40

[things look like so like equally cool is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m44s)
01:20:44

[not just tell like you know that a is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m49s)
01:20:49

[now incredibly precise and accurate that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m52s)
01:20:52

[the fact that it knows that blurry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m55s)
01:20:55

[things needs a stable area so I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h20m56s)
01:20:56

[know if you're as amazed that this is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m01s)
01:21:01

[am but I thought this was a pretty cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m02s)
01:21:02

[result and there you know we could run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m03s)
01:21:03

[this over 24 hour period on maybe 2 we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m07s)
01:21:07

[post of all of imagenet and presumably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m10s)
01:21:10

[it get even better still there we go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m11s)
01:21:11

[ok so let's take a 7 minute break and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m14s)
01:21:14

[see you back here at 5:00 class station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m17s)
01:21:17

[in general okay thanks everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m24s)
01:21:24

[that was fun so we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m31s)
01:21:31

[something else fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m35s)
01:21:35

[and that is to look at Oh actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m39s)
01:21:39

[prefer to continue I did want to mention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m46s)
01:21:46

[one thing in the homework that I changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m48s)
01:21:48

[which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m52s)
01:21:52

[I realized in my in my like manually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h21m56s)
01:21:56

[created loss function I was already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m02s)
01:22:02

[doing a mean squared error in the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m04s)
01:22:04

[function but then when I like told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m10s)
01:22:10

[Terrace like make that thing as close to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[zero as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m15s)
01:22:15

[I had to also give it the loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m16s)
01:22:16

[and I was giving it MSE and effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m18s)
01:22:18

[that was like kind of squaring right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m21s)
01:22:21

[squared errors that seemed wrong so I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m23s)
01:22:23

[changed it to M ay e mean absolute error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m25s)
01:22:25

[so when you look back over the notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m28s)
01:22:28

[sense that's why is because this is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m30s)
01:22:30

[to say hey get the last as close to zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m33s)
01:22:33

[as possible I didn't really want to read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m37s)
01:22:37

[where it that didn't make any sense so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m40s)
01:22:40

[and that's that's why you'll see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m43s)
01:22:43

[minor change the only thing to mention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m45s)
01:22:45

[is I I didn't notice that when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m49s)
01:22:49

[retrained my super resolution on my new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m51s)
01:22:51

[images that didn't have the black border](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m55s)
01:22:55

[it gave good results much much faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h22m57s)
01:22:57

[and so I really think that thing is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m00s)
01:23:00

[learning to put the black border back in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m03s)
01:23:03

[seemed to take quite a lot of effort for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m05s)
01:23:05

[it so again hopefully some of you were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m07s)
01:23:07

[gonna look into that in more detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m10s)
01:23:10

[um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m14s)
01:23:14

[so we're going to learn about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m15s)
01:23:15

[adversarial Network generative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m17s)
01:23:17

[adversarial networks and this will kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m19s)
01:23:19

[of close off a deep dive into German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m21s)
01:23:21

[generative models as applied to images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m23s)
01:23:23

[and just you know to remind you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m26s)
01:23:26

[purpose of this has been to learn about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m30s)
01:23:30

[generative models not so specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m32s)
01:23:32

[learn about super-resolution or artistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m34s)
01:23:34

[style but you know remember these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m37s)
01:23:37

[can be used to create four kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m40s)
01:23:40

[images so one of the groups is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m42s)
01:23:42

[interested in taking a 2d photo and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m44s)
01:23:44

[trying to turn it into something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m47s)
01:23:47

[you can rotate in 3d or at least show a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m49s)
01:23:49

[different angle of that 2d photo and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m51s)
01:23:51

[that's a great example of something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m53s)
01:23:53

[is you're totally work for you know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m55s)
01:23:55

[just a mapping from one image to some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h23m58s)
01:23:58

[different image just like what this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m01s)
01:24:01

[image look like from above versus from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m02s)
01:24:02

[the kernel but keep in mind the purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m04s)
01:24:04

[of this is just like in part one we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m09s)
01:24:09

[learn about classification which you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m11s)
01:24:11

[use for thousand things now we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m14s)
01:24:14

[learning about generative models that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m16s)
01:24:16

[you can enter a different certainty now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m18s)
01:24:18

[any generative model you build you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m20s)
01:24:20

[make it better by adding on top of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m24s)
01:24:24

[again a generative adversarial Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m27s)
01:24:27

[and this is something I don't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m30s)
01:24:30

[feel like it's been fully appreciated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m33s)
01:24:33

[people I've seen generally tree scans as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m34s)
01:24:34

[a different way of creating a job that a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m37s)
01:24:37

[generative model but I think of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m40s)
01:24:40

[more is like why not create your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m43s)
01:24:43

[generative model using the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m45s)
01:24:45

[techniques we've been talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m46s)
01:24:46

[but then think of it this way think of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m49s)
01:24:49

[that all the artistic style stuff we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m50s)
01:24:50

[were doing and the the like my terrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m54s)
01:24:54

[attempt at a Simpsons cartoon version of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h24m57s)
01:24:57

[the picture and it looked nothing like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[The Simpsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m03s)
01:25:03

[so what would be one way to improve that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m05s)
01:25:05

[but one way to improve that would be to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m09s)
01:25:09

[create two networks there would be one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m12s)
01:25:12

[network that takes our picture which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m17s)
01:25:17

[actually not the Simpsons and takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m21s)
01:25:21

[another picture that actually is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m24s)
01:25:24

[Simpsons and maybe we can train a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m25s)
01:25:25

[network that takes those two photos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m28s)
01:25:28

[throw those two images and spits out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m30s)
01:25:30

[something saying is that a real Simpsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m33s)
01:25:33

[image or not okay and this thing will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m37s)
01:25:37

[call the discriminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m42s)
01:25:42

[so we could easily train a discriminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m48s)
01:25:48

[right now right it's just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m50s)
01:25:50

[classification networks just use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m52s)
01:25:52

[same techniques we used in part one we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m54s)
01:25:54

[feed it the two images and it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h25m56s)
01:25:56

[spit out a one if it's a real Simpsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m00s)
01:26:00

[cartoon and a zero if it's Jeremy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m02s)
01:26:02

[crappy generative model of Simpsons it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m05s)
01:26:05

[easy right we know how to do that right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m09s)
01:26:09

[now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m10s)
01:26:10

[okay go and build that now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m10s)
01:26:10

[go and build another model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m16s)
01:26:16

[hi that's room there's two images is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m22s)
01:26:22

[input yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m28s)
01:26:28

[wonderful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m31s)
01:26:31

[what was that or do people know so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m33s)
01:26:33

[would feed it one thing that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m36s)
01:26:36

[symptoms and one thing that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m38s)
01:26:38

[generative output it's up to you to feed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[it one one of each okay or alternatively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m43s)
01:26:43

[you could feed it one thing in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m48s)
01:26:48

[probably easier is to just to feed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m51s)
01:26:51

[one thing and it spits out is it the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m52s)
01:26:52

[Simpsons or is it isn't it the Simpsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m55s)
01:26:55

[and you could just mix the matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m57s)
01:26:57

[actually it's the latter that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h26m58s)
01:26:58

[going to do so that's probably easier as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m00s)
01:27:00

[my original wedding yes we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m06s)
01:27:06

[have one thing which is either not a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m09s)
01:27:09

[Simpsons or it is a Simpsons and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m11s)
01:27:11

[going to have a bit of mix of 50/50 of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m13s)
01:27:13

[those two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m15s)
01:27:15

[and we're going to have something come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m17s)
01:27:17

[out saying what do you think is it real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m19s)
01:27:19

[or not so this thing this discriminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m22s)
01:27:22

[from now on will probably generally to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m26s)
01:27:26

[this be calling it d thanks is the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m27s)
01:27:27

[Cordy and we can think of that as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m30s)
01:27:30

[function right C is a function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m32s)
01:27:32

[takes some input X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m35s)
01:27:35

[which is an image right and fits out a 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m38s)
01:27:38

[or a 0 or maybe a probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m42s)
01:27:42

[what we could now do is create another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m48s)
01:27:48

[neural network and what this neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m50s)
01:27:50

[network is going to do is it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m54s)
01:27:54

[take as input some random noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h27m56s)
01:27:56

[just like our all of our generators have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m00s)
01:28:00

[so far okay and it's going to spit out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m03s)
01:28:03

[an image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m06s)
01:28:06

[and the lost function is going to be if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m11s)
01:28:11

[you take that image and stick it through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m14s)
01:28:14

[D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m16s)
01:28:16

[did you manage to fool us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m20s)
01:28:20

[all right so could you create something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m23s)
01:28:23

[where in fact we want it to say oh yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m25s)
01:28:25

[totally that's a simple that's a real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m27s)
01:28:27

[Simpsons so if that was our last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m29s)
01:28:29

[function but we're going to call this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m33s)
01:28:33

[the generator for call it G right it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m35s)
01:28:35

[just something exactly like our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m37s)
01:28:37

[perceptual losses style transfer model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m39s)
01:28:39

[could be exactly the same model okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m42s)
01:28:42

[that the last function is now going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m43s)
01:28:43

[be take the output of that and stick it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m46s)
01:28:46

[through D the discriminator and try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m48s)
01:28:48

[trick it right so the generators doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m51s)
01:28:51

[well if the discriminate is getting it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m54s)
01:28:54

[wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m56s)
01:28:56

[in fact so one way to do this would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h28m58s)
01:28:58

[to take our discriminator and train it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m01s)
01:29:01

[as best as we can to recognize the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m04s)
01:29:04

[difference between our crappy Simpsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m06s)
01:29:06

[and real Simpsons and then get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m08s)
01:29:08

[generator and train it to trick that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m11s)
01:29:11

[discriminator but now at the end of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m14s)
01:29:14

[it's probably still not very good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m16s)
01:29:16

[because you realize that actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m18s)
01:29:18

[discriminator didn't have to be very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m19s)
01:29:19

[good before because my Simpsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m21s)
01:29:21

[generators were so bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m23s)
01:29:23

[so I could now go back and retrain the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m25s)
01:29:25

[discriminator based on my better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m27s)
01:29:27

[generated images and then I can go back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m30s)
01:29:30

[and retrain the generator and back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m32s)
01:29:32

[forth I go and then is the general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m35s)
01:29:35

[approach of again is to keep going back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m38s)
01:29:38

[between two things which is training a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m41s)
01:29:41

[discriminator and training a generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m44s)
01:29:44

[using a discriminator as a loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m48s)
01:29:48

[so we've got one thing which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m50s)
01:29:50

[discriminator on some image and another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m55s)
01:29:55

[thing which is a discriminator on a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h29m58s)
01:29:58

[generator on some noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m02s)
01:30:02

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m07s)
01:30:07

[yeah yeah so in practice these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m15s)
01:30:15

[are going to spit out probabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m18s)
01:30:18

[okay so that's the general idea in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m23s)
01:30:23

[practice they found it very difficult to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m27s)
01:30:27

[do this like train the discriminator as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m34s)
01:30:34

[best as we can stop train the generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m36s)
01:30:36

[as best as we can so instead of what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[original gand paper that's fine then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m44s)
01:30:44

[right now the original gand paper is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m47s)
01:30:47

[called generative adversarial Nets and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m49s)
01:30:49

[what they did was to and here you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m53s)
01:30:53

[see they've actually specified this loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m56s)
01:30:56

[function so here it is a notation right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m57s)
01:30:57

[is two and they call it minimizing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h30m59s)
01:30:59

[generator whilst maximizing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m06s)
01:31:06

[discriminator this is what min max is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m08s)
01:31:08

[referring to what they do in practice is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m11s)
01:31:11

[they do it a batch at a time and so they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m15s)
01:31:15

[have a loop I'm going to go through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m17s)
01:31:17

[loop into a single batch through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m18s)
01:31:18

[discriminator that same batch stick it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m21s)
01:31:21

[through the generator and so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m23s)
01:31:23

[to do it a batch at a time so let's look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m26s)
01:31:26

[at that so here's the original game from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m28s)
01:31:28

[that paper and we're going to do it on M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m32s)
01:31:32

[list and what we're going to do is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m35s)
01:31:35

[going to see if we can start from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m37s)
01:31:37

[scratch to create something which can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m38s)
01:31:38

[create images which the discriminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m41s)
01:31:41

[cannot tell whether they're real or fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m47s)
01:31:47

[and it's a discriminator that has LEDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m50s)
01:31:50

[the good at discriminating real from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m53s)
01:31:53

[fake pictures of init endless images so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m55s)
01:31:55

[a loaded in earnest and the first thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h31m58s)
01:31:58

[they do in the paper is just used a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m01s)
01:32:01

[standard multilayered cetera so under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m03s)
01:32:03

[skip over that and let's get to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m09s)
01:32:09

[perceptron so here's our generator it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m11s)
01:32:11

[just a standard multi-layer perceptron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m15s)
01:32:15

[and here's our discriminator which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m17s)
01:32:17

[also a standard multi-layer perceptron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m20s)
01:32:20

[their generator has a sigmoid activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m22s)
01:32:22

[so in other words we're going to spit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m25s)
01:32:25

[out an image where all of the pixels are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m27s)
01:32:27

[between 0 and 1 so if you want to print](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m30s)
01:32:30

[it out we'll just multiply it by 255 I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m32s)
01:32:32

[guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m34s)
01:32:34

[so there's our generator there's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m36s)
01:32:36

[discriminator so there's then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m37s)
01:32:37

[combination of the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m41s)
01:32:41

[so take the generator and stick it into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m42s)
01:32:42

[the discriminator so we can just use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m44s)
01:32:44

[sequential for that and this is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m45s)
01:32:45

[therefore the loss function that I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m48s)
01:32:48

[on my generator is generate something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m50s)
01:32:50

[and then carefully fold the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m53s)
01:32:53

[discriminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m54s)
01:32:54

[so these are my architectures setup so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h32m56s)
01:32:56

[the next thing I need to do is set up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m01s)
01:33:01

[this thing called train which is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m02s)
01:33:02

[to do this adversarial training let's go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m04s)
01:33:04

[back and have a look at train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m07s)
01:33:07

[so what train is going to going to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m10s)
01:33:10

[going to go through a bunch of epochs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m12s)
01:33:12

[and notice here I wrap it in this TQ DM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m13s)
01:33:13

[this is the thing that creates a magical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m17s)
01:33:17

[progress bar doesn't do anything else to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m19s)
01:33:19

[just create a little progress bar we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m21s)
01:33:21

[learned about that last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m22s)
01:33:22

[so the first thing I need to do is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m24s)
01:33:24

[generate some data to feed the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m27s)
01:33:27

[discriminator so create a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m30s)
01:33:30

[function to that and here's my little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m31s)
01:33:31

[function so it's going to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m34s)
01:33:34

[little bit of data that's real and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m36s)
01:33:36

[little bit of data to fake okay so my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m38s)
01:33:38

[real data is okay let's go into my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m41s)
01:33:41

[actual training set and grab some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m43s)
01:33:43

[randomly selected emne stitches that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m46s)
01:33:46

[my real bit and then let's create some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m50s)
01:33:50

[fake right so noise is a function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m54s)
01:33:54

[I've just created up here which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m58s)
01:33:58

[create some 100 random numbers okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h33m59s)
01:33:59

[so let's create some noise orgy predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m02s)
01:34:02

[right and so then I can catenate the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m06s)
01:34:06

[together so now I've got some real data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m08s)
01:34:08

[and some fake data and so this is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m10s)
01:34:10

[to try and predict whether or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m14s)
01:34:14

[something is fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m16s)
01:34:16

[so one means fake zero means real so I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m17s)
01:34:17

[going to return my my data and my maples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[which is a bunch of zeros say they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[all real a bunch of ones to say they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m29s)
01:34:29

[all fake okay so there's my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m31s)
01:34:31

[discriminative data now go ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m33s)
01:34:33

[create a set of data for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m35s)
01:34:35

[discriminator and then do one batch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m38s)
01:34:38

[training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m41s)
01:34:41

[now I'm going to do the same thing for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m44s)
01:34:44

[the generator but when I train the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m47s)
01:34:47

[generator I don't want to change the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m49s)
01:34:49

[discriminators weights right so make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m51s)
01:34:51

[trainable simply go through each layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m54s)
01:34:54

[and said it's not trainable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m56s)
01:34:56

[so make my discriminator non trainable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m57s)
01:34:57

[and do one batch of training where I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h34m59s)
01:34:59

[taking noise there's my inputs and my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m03s)
01:35:03

[goal is to get the discriminator to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m08s)
01:35:08

[think that they are actually real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m10s)
01:35:10

[so it's why I'm passing in a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m14s)
01:35:14

[zeros because remember zero means real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m16s)
01:35:16

[and that's it and then make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m19s)
01:35:19

[discriminator trainable again so keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m21s)
01:35:21

[working through this train the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m23s)
01:35:23

[discriminator on a batch of up real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m25s)
01:35:25

[half-baked and then train the generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m29s)
01:35:29

[to try and trick the discriminator using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m31s)
01:35:31

[all fake repeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m35s)
01:35:35

[so that's the training loop that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m38s)
01:35:38

[basic game because we use TQ DM we get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m41s)
01:35:41

[an astral progress bar we can plot out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m44s)
01:35:44

[the I kept track of the last at each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m49s)
01:35:49

[step so there's our lofts for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m51s)
01:35:51

[discriminator and there's our loss to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m53s)
01:35:53

[the generator so a question is what are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m55s)
01:35:55

[these lost curves mean are they good or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m58s)
01:35:58

[bad like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h35m59s)
01:35:59

[how do we know and the answer is but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m02s)
01:36:02

[this kind of can they mean nothing at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m05s)
01:36:05

[all like the generator could get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m07s)
01:36:07

[fantastic but it could be because the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m10s)
01:36:10

[discriminate is terrible and like they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m12s)
01:36:12

[don't really know whether each one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m14s)
01:36:14

[good or not so like even the order of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m16s)
01:36:16

[magnitude of both of them is meaningless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m18s)
01:36:18

[so these curves me nothing the direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m19s)
01:36:19

[of the curves mean nothing and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m23s)
01:36:23

[one of the real difficulty through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m25s)
01:36:25

[training dance and here's what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m26s)
01:36:26

[when I plot 12 randomly selected random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m30s)
01:36:30

[noise vectors duck through there and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m34s)
01:36:34

[have not got things above terribly like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m38s)
01:36:38

[endless digits and they also don't look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m39s)
01:36:39

[terribly much like they have a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m41s)
01:36:41

[variety this is called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m42s)
01:36:42

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m47s)
01:36:47

[load class very common problem when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m49s)
01:36:49

[training against and what it means is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m53s)
01:36:53

[that the generator and the discriminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m56s)
01:36:56

[have kind of reached a stalemate where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h36m58s)
01:36:58

[neither you know neither 'litham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m01s)
01:37:01

[basically knows how to go from here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m03s)
01:37:03

[in terms of optimization we've basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m05s)
01:37:05

[found a local minima right so okay that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m08s)
01:37:08

[was not very successful can we do better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m13s)
01:37:13

[so the next page of paper that came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m15s)
01:37:15

[along was this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m17s)
01:37:17

[the topic is called unsupervised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m23s)
01:37:23

[representation learning with deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m27s)
01:37:27

[convolutional derivative adversarial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m28s)
01:37:28

[networks so this created something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m29s)
01:37:29

[they called DC games and the main page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m33s)
01:37:33

[that you want to look at here is page 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m38s)
01:37:38

[where they say core to our approach is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m41s)
01:37:41

[doing these three things and basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m44s)
01:37:44

[what they do is they just do exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m47s)
01:37:47

[same thing as gans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m49s)
01:37:49

[but they do three things one is to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m50s)
01:37:50

[the kinds of one for all of them is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m52s)
01:37:52

[learn the tricks that we've been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m55s)
01:37:55

[learning for generative models here's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m57s)
01:37:57

[all convolutional net get rid of max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h37m59s)
01:37:59

[pooling and use trader convolutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m03s)
01:38:03

[instead get rid of fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m04s)
01:38:04

[layers and use lots of convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m07s)
01:38:07

[features instead and add in national ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m08s)
01:38:08

[and then use a CNN rather than MRP so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m12s)
01:38:12

[here is that right there's a little very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m18s)
01:38:18

[familiar it looks just like last lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m21s)
01:38:21

[and stuff right so the generator is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m22s)
01:38:22

[going to take in some random grid of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m25s)
01:38:25

[inputs it's going to do a batch norm up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m30s)
01:38:30

[sample you'll notice that I'm doing even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m34s)
01:38:34

[newer than this paper I'm doing the up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m36s)
01:38:36

[sampling approach because we know that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m38s)
01:38:38

[better up sample one by one calms batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m40s)
01:38:40

[norm of sample one by one cons batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m43s)
01:38:43

[norm and then a final column player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m46s)
01:38:46

[discriminator basically does the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m50s)
01:38:50

[opposite which is some two by two sub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m52s)
01:38:52

[samplings so down sampling in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m54s)
01:38:54

[discriminator another trick that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h38m57s)
01:38:57

[mentioned I think it's mentioned in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m01s)
01:39:01

[paper is to before you do the back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m02s)
01:39:02

[forth batch for the discriminator and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m06s)
01:39:06

[bachelor generator is to train the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m08s)
01:39:08

[discriminator for a fraction of an epoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m11s)
01:39:11

[like there are few batches through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m14s)
01:39:14

[discriminator so at least it knows how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m16s)
01:39:16

[to recognize the difference between a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m18s)
01:39:18

[random image and a real image a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m19s)
01:39:19

[bit and so you can see here actually to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m22s)
01:39:22

[start by calling discriminative it it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m24s)
01:39:24

[just a very small amount of data so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m28s)
01:39:28

[is kind of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m31s)
01:39:31

[bootstrapping the discriminator and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m33s)
01:39:33

[I just go ahead and call the same train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m36s)
01:39:36

[as we had before with my other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m38s)
01:39:38

[architectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m41s)
01:39:41

[and again these curves are kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m44s)
01:39:44

[totally meaningless but we had something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m45s)
01:39:45

[which if you squint you could almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m49s)
01:39:49

[convince yourself of that survived any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m51s)
01:39:51

[so until a week or two before this all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h39m54s)
01:39:54

[started this was kind of about as good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m01s)
01:40:01

[as we had people were much better at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m04s)
01:40:04

[artisanal details of this than I was and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m07s)
01:40:07

[indeed there's a whole page called gang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m10s)
01:40:10

[hacks which had lots of tips but then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m12s)
01:40:12

[couple of weeks before this class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m20s)
01:40:20

[started as I mentioned in the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m22s)
01:40:22

[class along came the wasa Stein game and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m23s)
01:40:23

[the wasps tank and got rid of all these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m27s)
01:40:27

[problems and here is the wasa same can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m30s)
01:40:30

[ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m33s)
01:40:33

[and this paper is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m37s)
01:40:37

[quite an extraordinary paper and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m44s)
01:40:44

[particularly extraordinary because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m46s)
01:40:46

[think I mentioned this in playing in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m48s)
01:40:48

[first class of this part both papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m50s)
01:40:50

[tend to either be math theory that goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m54s)
01:40:54

[nowhere or kind of nice experiments and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m57s)
01:40:57

[engineering where the theory gets kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h40m59s)
01:40:59

[of tacked on at the end and kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m02s)
01:41:02

[minimus this paper is entirely driven by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m04s)
01:41:04

[theory and then the theory they go on to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m09s)
01:41:09

[show this is what the theory means this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m13s)
01:41:13

[is what we do and suddenly all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m15s)
01:41:15

[problems go away the lost curves are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m16s)
01:41:16

[going to actually mean something and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m18s)
01:41:18

[we're going to be able to do what I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m20s)
01:41:20

[said we wanted to do right at the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m21s)
01:41:21

[of this gen Dan section which is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m23s)
01:41:23

[train the discriminator a whole bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m27s)
01:41:27

[steps and then do a generator and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m30s)
01:41:30

[discriminator a whole bunch of steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m32s)
01:41:32

[into the generator and all that is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m33s)
01:41:33

[to suddenly start working how do we get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m35s)
01:41:35

[it to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m39s)
01:41:39

[so in fact despite the fact that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m41s)
01:41:41

[paper is both long and full of equations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m43s)
01:41:43

[and theorems and proofs and there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m48s)
01:41:48

[whole bunch of appendices of the back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m52s)
01:41:52

[with more theorems and proofs there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m53s)
01:41:53

[actually only two things you need to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m56s)
01:41:56

[one is remove the log from the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h41m57s)
01:41:57

[function so rather than using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m01s)
01:42:01

[cross-entropy loss we're just going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m02s)
01:42:02

[use means Guidera that's one change and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m05s)
01:42:05

[the second change is we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m07s)
01:42:07

[constrain the weights so that they lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m11s)
01:42:11

[between negative 0.01 and positive point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m14s)
01:42:14

[no one we're going to constrain the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m16s)
01:42:16

[weights to make them more now in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m18s)
01:42:18

[process of seeing that's all we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m21s)
01:42:21

[to do is to kind of massively is to not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m22s)
01:42:22

[give credit for this paper right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m26s)
01:42:26

[this paper is is they figured out that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m28s)

[math from scratch but basically what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m44s)
01:42:44

[math says is is again the last function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m47s)

[for again is not really the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m52s)

[cross entropy loss function but in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h42m59s)

[and again what we really care about is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m01s)

[the difference between two distributions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m03s)

[shows that that loss function is hideous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m28s)

[have a nice smooth shape at all so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m38s)
01:43:38

[kind of explains why it is that we kept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m45s)

[getting this mode collapse and failing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m47s)

[to find nice minimum which is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m49s)
01:43:49

[that mathematically this loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m51s)
01:43:51

[does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m54s)
01:43:54

[not behave the way a good loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m54s)
01:43:54

[should and you know previously we've not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m56s)

[come across anything like this because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h43m59s)
01:43:59

[we have been training a single function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m02s)

[at a time we really understand those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m04s)

01:44:14

[know that they're kind of nice and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m16s)
01:44:16

[smooth and that they have pretty nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m17s)
01:44:17

[shapes and they do what we want them to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m19s)
01:44:19

[do in this case by training true things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m20s)
01:44:20

[kind of adversarially to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m24s)
01:44:24

[we're actually doing something quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m25s)
01:44:25

[different at this paper just absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m28s)
01:44:28

[fantastically show shows with both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m31s)

[examples and the theory why that's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m34s)
01:44:34

[never going to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m36s)
01:44:36

[we use lysimachus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m41s)
01:44:41

[um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m48s)
01:44:48

[yes but the I mean even the cosine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m51s)
01:44:51

[distance so the cosine distance is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m54s)
01:44:54

[difference between two things or else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h44m58s)
01:44:58

[these distances that we're talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m00s)
01:45:00

[here are the distances between two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m02s)
01:45:02

[distributions which is a much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m03s)
01:45:03

[tricky problem to deal with the cosine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m05s)
01:45:05

[distance actually if you if you look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m09s)
01:45:09

[the notebook during the week you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m12s)
01:45:12

[it's basically the same as the Euclidean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m13s)
01:45:13

[distance that you normalize the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m17s)
01:45:17

[first so it has all the same nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m20s)
01:45:20

[properties that the Euclidean distance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m22s)
01:45:22

[so the so one things fun is that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m25s)
01:45:25

[authors of this paper released their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m31s)
01:45:31

[code in pi torch and luckily Platzer pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m34s)
01:45:34

[torch the first kind of pre-release came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m38s)
01:45:38

[out in mid-january he won't be surprised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m40s)
01:45:40

[to hear that one of the authors of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m44s)
01:45:44

[paper is the main author of pi torch so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m45s)
01:45:45

[he was writing this before we even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m49s)
01:45:49

[released the code there's lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m51s)
01:45:51

[reasons we want to learn play torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m54s)
01:45:54

[anyway so here's a good reason right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m55s)
01:45:55

[let's look at the Wasserstein gain in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h45m58s)
01:45:58

[play torch most most of the code can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m00s)
01:46:00

[catch other than this pretty much all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m04s)
01:46:04

[the code I'm showing you in this part of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m05s)
01:46:05

[the course is very loosely based on lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m08s)
01:46:08

[of bits of other code which I had to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m12s)
01:46:12

[massively rewrite because all of it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m13s)
01:46:13

[wrong and hideous this code actually I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m15s)
01:46:15

[only did some minor refactoring to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m18s)
01:46:18

[simplify things so this is actually very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m20s)
01:46:20

[close to their code and so there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m22s)
01:46:22

[very nice paper with very nice code so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m25s)
01:46:25

[that's great thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m28s)
01:46:28

[so before we look at the wealth of stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m30s)
01:46:30

[I guess it's the fastest time really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m32s)
01:46:32

[does the stone again in play torch let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m33s)
01:46:33

[look briefly a play torch okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m37s)
01:46:37

[so pay torch basically what you're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m39s)
01:46:39

[to see is that I torch looks a lot like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m42s)
01:46:42

[numpy which is nice we don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m44s)
01:46:44

[create a computational graph using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m49s)
01:46:49

[variables and placeholders and later on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m53s)
01:46:53

[round in a session and blah blah blah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m55s)
01:46:55

[thank you I'm sure you've seen by now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m57s)
01:46:57

[with you know care a script tends to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h46m59s)
01:46:59

[flow you try to print something out that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m03s)
01:47:03

[some intermediate output it just prints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m04s)
01:47:04

[out like cancer and tells you how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m06s)
01:47:06

[dimensions it has but that's because all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m08s)
01:47:08

[that thing is symbolic side of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m11s)
01:47:11

[computational breath PI torch doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m13s)
01:47:13

[work that way pi torch is what's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m16s)
01:47:16

[a defined by run framework it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m18s)
01:47:18

[basically designed to be so fast to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m21s)
01:47:21

[your code and compile it that you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m27s)
01:47:27

[have to create that graph in advance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m30s)
01:47:30

[like every time you run a piece of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m32s)
01:47:32

[it puts it on the GPU runs it sends it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m34s)
01:47:34

[back all in one go so it makes things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m38s)
01:47:38

[look very simple so this is a slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m41s)
01:47:41

[cut-down version of the PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m44s)
01:47:44

[tutorial that PI torch provides on their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m46s)
01:47:46

[website so you can grab that from there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m48s)
01:47:48

[so rather than creating NPO terrain you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m51s)
01:47:51

[create torch tensor but other than that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m55s)
01:47:55

[it's identical right so here's a random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h47m58s)
01:47:58

[torch tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m01s)
01:48:01

[rather than a few guys all a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m08s)
01:48:08

[different rather than Shaitaan size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m11s)
01:48:11

[but you can settle through similar right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m16s)
01:48:16

[and so unlike in enter flow or theano we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m18s)
01:48:18

[can just say X plus y and there it is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m22s)
01:48:22

[don't have to say that equaled X plus y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m24s)
01:48:24

[equals function takes X and y inputs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m27s)
01:48:27

[because there's output and then in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m31s)
01:48:31

[function dot a vowel no just X plus y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m33s)
01:48:33

[and there it is as you can see why it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m35s)
01:48:35

[called defined by run we just provide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m38s)
01:48:38

[the code and it just runs it generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m41s)
01:48:41

[speaking most operations in torch as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m45s)
01:48:45

[well as having this in fixed version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m47s)
01:48:47

[there's also a suffix of so prefix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m48s)
01:48:48

[version this is exactly the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m51s)
01:48:51

[um you can often add and that nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m54s)
01:48:54

[always a day out equals and that puts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m57s)
01:48:57

[the results in this pre allocated memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h48m59s)
01:48:59

[we've already talked about way it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m01s)
01:49:01

[really important to pre allocate memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m03s)
01:49:03

[it's particularly important on GPUs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m05s)
01:49:05

[so if you write your own algorithms in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m08s)
01:49:08

[pipe torch you need to be very careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m10s)
01:49:10

[of this perhaps the best trick is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m12s)
01:49:12

[you can stick an underscore on the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m15s)
01:49:15

[of most things and it causes it to in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m17s)
01:49:17

[place this is basically y plus equals x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m19s)
01:49:19

[that's what this underscore had again so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m22s)
01:49:22

[there's some good little tricks you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m26s)
01:49:26

[do splicing just like numpy you can turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m28s)
01:49:28

[numpy stuff into torch tensors and vice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m32s)
01:49:32

[versa by simply going numpy and one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m35s)
01:49:35

[thing to be very aware of is that a and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m40s)
01:49:40

[b are now referring to the same thing so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m43s)
01:49:43

[that if I now add underscore so in place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m48s)
01:49:48

[a plus equals one it also changes be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m52s)
01:49:52

[okay vice versa you can turn on play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h49m57s)
01:49:57

[into torch by calling torch from numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m00s)
01:50:00

[and again same thing if you change the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m03s)
01:50:03

[none fire change of the torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m06s)
01:50:06

[all of that so far is been running on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m10s)
01:50:10

[the CPU to turn anything into something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m12s)
01:50:12

[that runs on the GPU your Chuck scooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m15s)
01:50:15

[at the end of it okay so this X plus y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m17s)
01:50:17

[just ran on the GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m20s)
01:50:20

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m22s)
01:50:22

[so where things get cool is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m24s)
01:50:24

[something like this no it's not just how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m27s)
01:50:27

[to do the that piece of arithmetic but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m30s)
01:50:30

[it also knows how to take the gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m33s)
01:50:33

[of that gradient you just take your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m34s)
01:50:34

[torch tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m40s)
01:50:40

[wrap it in variable and add this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m41s)
01:50:41

[parameter to it and now from now on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m45s)
01:50:45

[anything I do to X it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m47s)
01:50:47

[remember what I did so that it can take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m49s)
01:50:49

[the gradient of it so for example X plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m51s)
01:50:51

[2 okay I get back three just like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m55s)
01:50:55

[normal tensor so a variable and attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m58s)
01:50:58

[to have the same API except that I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h50m59s)
01:50:59

[keep doing things to it squared times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m04s)
01:51:04

[three mean later on I can go dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m08s)
01:51:08

[backward and grad and I can get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m12s)
01:51:12

[gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m15s)
01:51:15

[match the critical difference between a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m16s)
01:51:16

[tensor and the variable they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m20s)
01:51:20

[exactly the same API exact variable also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m22s)
01:51:22

[has backward and that gets you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m24s)
01:51:24

[gradient so when I say top gradient the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m28s)
01:51:28

[reason that this is the out DX is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m31s)
01:51:31

[because I typed out backward all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m33s)
01:51:33

[so this is the thing it's the derivative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m37s)
01:51:37

[is for respect to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m38s)
01:51:38

[kind of crazy you can do things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m45s)
01:51:45

[while loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m46s)
01:51:46

[get the gradients of them this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m49s)
01:51:49

[seeing pretty tricky to do with Spencer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m52s)
01:51:52

[flow or piano or these kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m55s)
01:51:55

[computation graph approaches so it gives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m56s)
01:51:56

[you a whole lot of flexibility to define](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h51m58s)
01:51:58

[things in like much more natural ways so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m01s)
01:52:01

[you can really write play torch just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m06s)
01:52:06

[like you're writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m08s)
01:52:08

[regular old kind of non play stuff it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m08s)
01:52:08

[has plenty of libraries so if you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m15s)
01:52:15

[to create a neural network here's how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m17s)
01:52:17

[you do a CNN I want you early on that if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m19s)
01:52:19

[you don't know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m24s)
01:52:24

[oh whoa and pipes immunity to my lotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m25s)
01:52:25

[so here's why because in play torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m27s)
01:52:27

[everything kind of done years ago oh I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m30s)
01:52:30

[really like this track because like in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m32s)
01:52:32

[in piano I'm sorry intensive flow they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m34s)
01:52:34

[kind of invent their own weird way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m38s)
01:52:38

[programming rather than use Python over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m41s)
01:52:41

[real play torch just goes out we already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m45s)
01:52:45

[have these features in the language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m48s)
01:52:48

[let's just use them so it's way easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m49s)
01:52:49

[in my opinion so to create a neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m52s)
01:52:52

[you create a new class you derive from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m56s)
01:52:56

[module and then in the constructor you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h52m59s)
01:52:59

[create all of the things that have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m03s)
01:53:03

[weights okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m05s)
01:53:05

[so these you know cons one is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m07s)
01:53:07

[something that has some weight 3d cons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m11s)
01:53:11

[come true is something with some weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m13s)
01:53:13

[poly connected one is something with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m15s)
01:53:15

[some ways okay so there's all of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m17s)
01:53:17

[layers and then you get to see exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m21s)
01:53:21

[what happens in your forward path right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m24s)
01:53:24

[now because max cool 2d doesn't have any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m27s)
01:53:27

[weights and revenue doesn't have any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m29s)
01:53:29

[weights there's no need to define them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m31s)
01:53:31

[in the initializer right you can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m35s)
01:53:35

[call them as functions but these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m37s)
01:53:37

[have works so they need to be at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m39s)
01:53:39

[stateful persistent so in my forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m43s)
01:53:43

[class you literally just define what are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m46s)
01:53:46

[the things that happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m49s)
01:53:49

[dot view is the same as reshape okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m51s)
01:53:51

[like the whole API has different names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m56s)
01:53:56

[for everything which is mildly annoying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h53m58s)
01:53:58

[for the first week that you kind of get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m01s)
01:54:01

[used to it so dot reshape is called docu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m02s)
01:54:02

[during the week if you try to use pay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m05s)
01:54:05

[torch and you're like how do you say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m07s)
01:54:07

[blah and pay torch and you can't find it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m09s)
01:54:09

[feel free to post on the forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m11s)
01:54:11

[having said that pay torch has its own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m13s)
01:54:13

[discourse based forums and as you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m17s)
01:54:17

[see it is just as busy and friendly as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m20s)
01:54:20

[our forums people are posting on these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m24s)
01:54:24

[all the time so I find it a really great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m26s)
01:54:26

[helpful community so feel free to ask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m31s)
01:54:31

[over there or over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m35s)
01:54:35

[um great so you can then put all of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m40s)
01:54:40

[computation under the GPU by calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m47s)
01:54:47

[Kuna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m49s)
01:54:49

[um now you can then take some input put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m51s)
01:54:51

[down the GPU with Doc CUDA you can then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m55s)
01:54:55

[calculate your derivatives calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h54m59s)
01:54:59

[your loss and then later on you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m04s)
01:55:04

[optimiser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m10s)
01:55:10

[this is just one step of the optimizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m12s)
01:55:12

[so we have to kind of put that in word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m15s)
01:55:15

[so there's the basic pieces at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m17s)
01:55:17

[here there's a complete process but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m20s)
01:55:20

[think more fun will be to see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m23s)
01:55:23

[process in the stone again so here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m24s)
01:55:24

[I've kind of got this torch utils thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m28s)
01:55:28

[which refining github which has the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m32s)
01:55:32

[basic stuff you'll want for torch all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m35s)
01:55:35

[there so you can just import that same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m37s)
01:55:37

[can working so we set up the batch size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m44s)
01:55:44

[the size of each image the size of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m46s)
01:55:46

[noise vector and look how cool it is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m50s)
01:55:50

[really like this this is how you import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m53s)
01:55:53

[data sets it has a data sets module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m55s)
01:55:55

[already in the torch vision library is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h55m59s)
01:55:59

[the sci-fi 10 data set it will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m03s)
01:56:03

[automatically download it to this path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m06s)
01:56:06

[for you if you say download equals true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m07s)
01:56:07

[and rather than having to figure out how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m09s)
01:56:09

[to do the pre-processing you can create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m13s)
01:56:13

[a list of transforms alright so I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m17s)
01:56:17

[it is really lovely API the reason that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m20s)
01:56:20

[this is so new it has such a nice API is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m23s)
01:56:23

[because this comes from a lower library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m26s)
01:56:26

[called torch that's been around for many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m28s)
01:56:28

[years and so these guys are basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m30s)
01:56:30

[started off by copying what they already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m32s)
01:56:32

[had and whatever already works well so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m35s)
01:56:35

[think it is very elegant there's another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m37s)
01:56:37

[so I've got two different things you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m41s)
01:56:41

[look at here they're both from the paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m44s)
01:56:44

[- a 5/10 which are the tiny little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m45s)
01:56:45

[images another is something we haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m48s)
01:56:48

[seen before which is called Elston which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m50s)
01:56:50

[is a really nice data set it's a huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m53s)
01:56:53

[data set with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h56m56s)
01:56:56

[millions of images three million bedroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m01s)
01:57:01

[images for example so we can use either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m03s)
01:57:03

[one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m09s)
01:57:09

[this is pretty cool we can then call up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m11s)
01:57:11

[create a data loader see how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m13s)
01:57:13

[workers use we already know what workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m15s)
01:57:15

[are right this is all built into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m17s)
01:57:17

[framework okay so now that you know how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m19s)
01:57:19

[many workers your GP your CPU likes to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m23s)
01:57:23

[use you can just go ahead and put that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m25s)
01:57:25

[number in here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m26s)
01:57:26

[use your CPU to load in this data in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m27s)
01:57:27

[parallel in the background okay so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m30s)
01:57:30

[going to start with say five ten so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m34s)

[very quickly because it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m52s)
01:57:52

[straightforward here's a cons block that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m53s)
01:57:53

[consists of a come to D the batch non 2d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h57m56s)
01:57:56

[and a leaky value so in my initializer I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m00s)
01:58:00

[can go ahead and say okay we'll start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m05s)
01:58:05

[with a current block optionally have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m07s)
01:58:07

[few extra comic blocks this is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m11s)
01:58:11

[nice here's a while loop that says keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m14s)
01:58:14

[adding more downsampling blocks until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m18s)
01:58:18

[you've varied up sampling blocks until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m20s)
01:58:20

[you've got as many as you need so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m26s)
01:58:26

[really nice kind of use of a while loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m29s)
01:58:29

[to simplify our getting our architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m31s)
01:58:31

[and then a final comic block at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m35s)
01:58:35

[to actually create the thing we want and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m38s)
01:58:38

[then this is pretty nifty if you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m41s)
01:58:41

[pass in ng to you greater than one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m45s)
01:58:45

[then it will call parallel data parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m50s)
01:58:50

[passing in those GPU IDs and it will do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m53s)
01:58:53

[automatic multi-gpu training so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h58m56s)
01:58:56

[like by far the easiest multi-gpu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m00s)
01:59:00

[training I've ever seen so yeah that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m02s)
01:59:02

[it that's the that's the forward pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m07s)
01:59:07

[behind huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m08s)
01:59:08

[the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m13s)
01:59:13

[um we'll learn more about this over the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m19s)
01:59:19

[next couple of weeks in fact given we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m23s)
01:59:23

[a little short of time let let's discuss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m26s)
01:59:26

[that next week and let me know if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m29s)
01:59:29

[don't think you cover it um okay here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m31s)
01:59:31

[a generator looks very very similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m34s)
01:59:34

[again as a while loop to make sure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m36s)
01:59:36

[we've gone through them great number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m38s)
01:59:38

[decomp blocks so this is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m39s)
01:59:39

[interesting this would probably be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m46s)
01:59:46

[better off with an up sampling blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m47s)
01:59:47

[followed by a one-by-one convolution so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m49s)
01:59:49

[maybe at home you could try this and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m52s)
01:59:52

[if you get better results because this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m53s)
01:59:53

[is probably got the checkerboard pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m55s)
01:59:55

[problem okay so there's a generator and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=01h59m57s)
01:59:57

[our discriminator 20 75 lines of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m01s)
02:00:01

[nice and easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m04s)
02:00:04

[you know everything is a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m09s)
02:00:09

[different implied torch if we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m10s)
02:00:10

[say what initializer to use again we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m11s)
02:00:11

[going to kind of use a little bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m14s)
02:00:14

[it's kind of more decoupled maybe at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m17s)
02:00:17

[first it's a little more complex there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m20s)
02:00:20

[less things you have to learn you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m22s)
02:00:22

[cut through in this case we can call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m24s)
02:00:24

[something called apply which takes some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m26s)
02:00:26

[function and asses it to everything in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m28s)
02:00:28

[our architecture so this function is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m32s)
02:00:32

[something that says oh is this a comp to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m34s)
02:00:34

[D your comm transpose to D if so use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m37s)
02:00:37

[this initialization function or if it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m40s)
02:00:40

[a batch norm use this initialization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m43s)
02:00:43

[function okay so again you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m45s)
02:00:45

[everything's a little bit different you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m48s)
02:00:48

[there isn't a separate initialize a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m49s)
02:00:49

[parameter this is in my opinion much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m51s)
02:00:51

[more flexible I really like it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h00m54s)
02:00:54

[so as before we need something to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m01s)
02:01:01

[some noise so let's go ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m04s)
02:01:04

[creating some fixed noise we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m09s)
02:01:09

[have an optimizer for the discriminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m12s)
02:01:12

[we've got an optimizer for the generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m13s)
02:01:13

[here is something that does one step of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m16s)
02:01:16

[the discriminator right so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m18s)
02:01:18

[to call the forward pass and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m20s)
02:01:20

[call the backward pass and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m22s)
02:01:22

[return the error just like before we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m23s)
02:01:23

[got something called make trainable so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m27s)
02:01:27

[this is how we make something trainable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m29s)
02:01:29

[or not trainable in play torch and just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m32s)
02:01:32

[like before we have a train loop the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m35s)
02:01:35

[Train loop has got a little bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m38s)
02:01:38

[going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m42s)
02:01:42

[partly because of the vs. playing again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m42s)
02:01:42

[partly because of high torch but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m44s)
02:01:44

[basic idea is the same for each epoch or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m46s)
02:01:46

[each batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m52s)
02:01:52

[make the discriminative trainable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h01m57s)
02:01:57

[and then this is the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m01s)
02:02:01

[iterations to train the discriminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m04s)
02:02:04

[for so remember I told you one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m06s)
02:02:06

[nice things about the Vasa so again is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m08s)
02:02:08

[that we don't have to do one best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m10s)
02:02:10

[estimator one best generator one better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m13s)
02:02:13

[scream it at one best generator but we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m14s)
02:02:14

[can actually train the discriminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m16s)
02:02:16

[properly for a bunch of batches and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m17s)
02:02:17

[the paper they suggest using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m21s)
02:02:21

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m24s)
02:02:24

[five iterations or five batches of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m27s)
02:02:27

[discriminator training each time through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m31s)
02:02:31

[the loop unless it's one of less you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m34s)
02:02:34

[still in the first twenty five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m36s)
02:02:36

[generations to twenty five iterations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m37s)
02:02:37

[and say if you're in the first twenty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m39s)
02:02:39

[five iterations through our hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m40s)
02:02:40

[matches and then they also say from time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m43s)
02:02:43

[to time through 100 batches so it's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m45s)
02:02:45

[of nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m49s)
02:02:49

[by having the flexibility here to really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m50s)
02:02:50

[change things we can do exactly what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m53s)
02:02:53

[paper wants us to do so basically at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m55s)
02:02:55

[first we're going to train the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m58s)
02:02:58

[discriminator carefully and we're also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h02m59s)
02:02:59

[from time to time train the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m03s)
02:03:03

[discriminator very carefully otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m04s)
02:03:04

[we'll just do five batches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m06s)
02:03:06

[so this is where we go ahead and pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m09s)
02:03:09

[the discriminator and you'll see here we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m13s)
02:03:13

[plant as it's the same as clip the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m15s)
02:03:15

[weights in the discriminator to fall in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m19s)
02:03:19

[this range and if you're interested in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m23s)
02:03:23

[reading the paper the paper explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m25s)
02:03:25

[that the basically the reason that is is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m27s)
02:03:27

[that they're their assumptions are only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m29s)
02:03:29

[only true in this kind of small area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m34s)
02:03:34

[that's that's why we have to make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m38s)
02:03:38

[that the way to stay in a small area so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m39s)
02:03:39

[then we go ahead and do a single step of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m43s)
02:03:43

[the discriminator then we create the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m45s)
02:03:45

[noise and to a single step at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m49s)
02:03:49

[generator we get our fake data for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m51s)
02:03:51

[discriminator that we can subtract the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h03m59s)
02:03:59

[fake from the real to get our error the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m02s)
02:04:02

[discriminator so there's one step of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m05s)
02:04:05

[discriminator we do that either 5 or 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m07s)
02:04:07

[or 100 times make our discriminator not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m12s)
02:04:12

[trainable and then do one step of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m18s)
02:04:18

[generator you can see here we call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m21s)
02:04:21

[generator with some noise and then pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m23s)
02:04:23

[it into the discriminator to see if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m26s)
02:04:26

[tricked it or not so during the week you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m28s)
02:04:28

[can look at this these two different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m32s)
02:04:32

[versions and you're going to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m34s)
02:04:34

[basically the pi torch and the carrot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m35s)
02:04:35

[version of basically the same thing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m38s)
02:04:38

[the only difference is in the two things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m40s)
02:04:40

[one is the presence of this clamping and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m44s)
02:04:44

[the second is that the loss function is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m47s)
02:04:47

[mean squared error rather than cross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m50s)
02:04:50

[interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m53s)
02:04:53

[so let's see what happens here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h04m55s)
02:04:55

[samples from 510](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m04s)
02:05:04

[so they're like certainly a lot better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m07s)
02:05:07

[than our crappy DT game mm most examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m09s)
02:05:09

[but they're not great why are they not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m17s)
02:05:17

[great so probably the reason they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m19s)
02:05:19

[great is because say 510 has quite a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m22s)
02:05:22

[categories different kinds of categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m26s)
02:05:26

[of different kinds of things and so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m28s)
02:05:28

[doesn't really know what it's meant to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m31s)
02:05:31

[be drawing a picture of sometimes I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m32s)
02:05:32

[guess it kind of pickets it out like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m34s)
02:05:34

[this must be a plan I think but a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m36s)
02:05:36

[the time it's kind of it hatches and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m39s)
02:05:39

[kind of draws a picture of something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m42s)
02:05:42

[that looks like it might be a reasonable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m43s)
02:05:43

[picture but it's not a picture of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m44s)
02:05:44

[anything in particular on the other hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m46s)
02:05:46

[the elf son data set as 3 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m48s)
02:05:48

[bedrooms so we would hope that when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m54s)
02:05:54

[train the vastest and Gannon else on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h05m57s)
02:05:57

[bedrooms we might get better results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m01s)
02:06:01

[so but here's the real side by 10 by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m04s)
02:06:04

[way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m07s)
02:06:07

[so here are a fake victims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m11s)
02:06:11

[and they are pretty freaking awesome so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m16s)
02:06:16

[literally they started out as random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m20s)
02:06:20

[noise and everyone has been turned in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m23s)
02:06:23

[like that definitely a bedroom when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m27s)
02:06:27

[they're all definitely different and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m29s)
02:06:29

[and then here is the real victims to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m31s)
02:06:31

[compare you can kind of see here that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m34s)
02:06:34

[like imagine if you talk of this and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m40s)
02:06:40

[stuck it on the end of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m43s)
02:06:43

[kind of generator you could you know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m46s)
02:06:46

[think really use this to make your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m50s)
02:06:50

[generator much more believable you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m52s)
02:06:52

[like whatever any time you kind of look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m55s)
02:06:55

[at it you say oh that doesn't look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h06m58s)
02:06:58

[the real X maybe you could try using a W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m00s)
02:07:00

[again to try to make it look more like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m04s)
02:07:04

[real next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m07s)
02:07:07

[so this paper is that and like so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m12s)
02:07:12

[important like this is basically so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m18s)
02:07:18

[here's the other thing the last the lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m21s)
02:07:21

[function for these actually makes sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m26s)
02:07:26

[like the discriminator and the generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m28s)
02:07:28

[loss functions actually decrease as they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m29s)
02:07:29

[get better so you can actually tell if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m33s)
02:07:33

[your thing is training properly you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m35s)
02:07:35

[actually kind of you can't exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m37s)
02:07:37

[compare through different architectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m39s)
02:07:39

[to each other still but you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m42s)
02:07:42

[certainly see that the training code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m45s)
02:07:45

[sort of working so now that we like have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m46s)
02:07:46

[you know in my opinion a gain that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m49s)
02:07:49

[actually really works reliably for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m53s)
02:07:53

[first time ever I thought like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m56s)
02:07:56

[changes the whole kind of changes the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h07m59s)
02:07:59

[equation for what generators can and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m03s)
02:08:03

[can't do and this has not been applied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m05s)
02:08:05

[to anything yet so you can take any old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m07s)
02:08:07

[paper that produces 3d outputs or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m13s)
02:08:13

[segmentations or depth outputs oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m18s)
02:08:18

[colorization or whatever and add this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m21s)
02:08:21

[and it would be great to see what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m23s)
02:08:23

[happens right because none of that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m25s)
02:08:25

[been done before and it's not been done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m28s)
02:08:28

[before because we haven't had a good way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m30s)
02:08:30

[to train can swivel so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m32s)
02:08:32

[you know this is kind of I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m38s)
02:08:38

[something where anybody who's interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m41s)
02:08:41

[in in a project yeah this would be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m44s)
02:08:44

[great project and something that maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m47s)
02:08:47

[you can do reasonably quickly another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m49s)
02:08:49

[thing you could do as a project is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m53s)
02:08:53

[convert this into chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m56s)
02:08:56

[like so you can take the care of dcen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h08m58s)
02:08:58

[notebook that we've already got and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m02s)
02:09:02

[change the loss function at the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m04s)
02:09:04

[tipping and try training on this elf own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m07s)
02:09:07

[bedroom data set and you should get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m10s)
02:09:10

[same results and then you can add this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m13s)
02:09:13

[on top of your any of your care of stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m15s)
02:09:15

[so yeah there's so much you could do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m19s)
02:09:19

[this week I'm I don't feel like I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m22s)
02:09:22

[to give you a assignment per se because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m25s)
02:09:25

[there's a thousand assignments you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m28s)
02:09:28

[do I think you know as per usual you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m30s)
02:09:30

[should go back and look at the papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m32s)
02:09:32

[the original Dan paper is a fairly easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m36s)
02:09:36

[read there's a section called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m40s)
02:09:40

[theoretical results which is like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m42s)
02:09:42

[is kind of like the pointless math bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m44s)
02:09:44

[you know like here's some theoretical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m48s)
02:09:48

[stuff it's actually interesting to read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m50s)
02:09:50

[this now because like you go back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m52s)
02:09:52

[you look at this stuff where they like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m54s)
02:09:54

[prove various nice things about their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m56s)
02:09:56

[game so like they're talking about how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h09m58s)
02:09:58

[the generative model perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m02s)
02:10:02

[replicates the data generating process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m03s)
02:10:03

[it's interesting to go back and look and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m05s)
02:10:05

[say like okay so they like prove these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m07s)
02:10:07

[things but it turned out to be totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m10s)
02:10:10

[pointless like like it still didn't work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m14s)
02:10:14

[like it didn't really work so it's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m17s)
02:10:17

[of interesting to look back and say oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m20s)
02:10:20

[so how you know how is it the people we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m21s)
02:10:21

[just doesn't say this isn't a good paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m23s)
02:10:23

[it is a good paper but it is interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m24s)
02:10:24

[to see like when when is the theoretical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m27s)
02:10:27

[stuff useful and we're not well then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m29s)
02:10:29

[look at the Buffett sign Gann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m31s)
02:10:31

[theoretical sections and it spends a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m33s)
02:10:33

[of time talking about why their Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m36s)
02:10:36

[actually matters so they have this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m39s)
02:10:39

[really cool example for example that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m42s)
02:10:42

[they say that's creating really simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m44s)
02:10:44

[what if you want to learn like let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m46s)
02:10:46

[just parallel lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m49s)
02:10:49

[and they show like why it is that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m50s)
02:10:50

[kind of old way of doing games can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m53s)
02:10:53

[mine parallel lines and then they show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m55s)
02:10:55

[how their different objective function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h10m58s)
02:10:58

[Emlyn parallel was so I think anybody is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m01s)
02:11:01

[interested in kind of getting into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m06s)
02:11:06

[theory a little bit it's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m08s)
02:11:08

[interesting to look at kind of like ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m10s)
02:11:10

[why did the you know proof of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m12s)
02:11:12

[convergence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m15s)
02:11:15

[you know like showed something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m16s)
02:11:16

[didn't show something that really turned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m19s)
02:11:19

[out to matter where else in this paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m20s)
02:11:20

[the theory turned out to be super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m22s)
02:11:22

[important and basically created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m25s)
02:11:25

[something that allowed gangs to work for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m27s)
02:11:27

[the first time so there's lots of stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m29s)
02:11:29

[you can get out of these papers if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m31s)
02:11:31

[you're if you're interested in terms of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m33s)
02:11:33

[the notation we might look at some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m37s)
02:11:37

[the notation a bit a little bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m40s)
02:11:40

[next week but if we look for example at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m41s)
02:11:41

[the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m46s)

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m54s)
02:11:54

[I think in general like the most the bid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h11m59s)
02:11:59

[I find the most useful nothing nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m02s)
02:12:02

[much of a math guy is the bit where they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m04s)
02:12:04

[actually write the pseudocode and even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m06s)
02:12:06

[that it's useful to learn some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m08s)
02:12:08

[nomenclature so for each iteration the h](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m13s)
02:12:13

[step easy what does it mean sample noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m17s)
02:12:17

[samples from noise prior probability no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m20s)
02:12:20

[main structure which you can very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m27s)
02:12:27

[quickly translate but a prior simply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m28s)
02:12:28

[means NP random dot nothing right so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m33s)
02:12:33

[this case you know we probably like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m39s)
02:12:39

[know NP random normal so this just means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m41s)
02:12:41

[you know some random number generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m45s)
02:12:45

[that you get to pick this one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m46s)
02:12:46

[sample from a data generating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m49s)
02:12:49

[distribution that means randomly pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m52s)
02:12:52

[some stuff from your array okay so these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m55s)
02:12:55

[are the two steps right generate some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m57s)
02:12:57

[random numbers and then randomly select](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h12m59s)
02:12:59

[some things from your array and actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m02s)
02:13:02

[in the and there's a bit where you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m05s)
02:13:05

[talked about the gradient you can kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m08s)
02:13:08

[of lightly ignore except the bit in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m10s)
02:13:10

[middle is your loss function they can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m13s)
02:13:13

[here you see here this said these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m15s)
02:13:15

[here is your noise sets your noise okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m19s)
02:13:19

[so noise generator on noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m21s)
02:13:21

[discriminator on generator on noise okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m24s)
02:13:24

[so there's the bit where we're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m27s)
02:13:27

[fool the discriminator and we're trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m27s)
02:13:27

[to make that trigger so that's why we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m30s)
02:13:30

[drew one minus and then here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m32s)
02:13:32

[getting the discriminator to be accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m34s)
02:13:34

[because these x's is the real data okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m36s)
02:13:36

[so that's a math version that will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m39s)
02:13:39

[displayed the Bossip sign can also has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m42s)
02:13:42

[algorithm section and so it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m48s)
02:13:48

[interesting to compare the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m51s)
02:13:51

[so here we go mr. Stein GAD is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m57s)
02:13:57

[algorithm and basically this says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h13m59s)
02:13:59

[exactly the same thing as the last one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h14m01s)
02:14:01

[said but you know I actually find this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h14m03s)
02:14:03

[one a big Stara sample from the real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h14m06s)
02:14:06

[data sample from your priors okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h14m08s)
02:14:08

[hopefully that's enough to get going and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h14m14s)
02:14:14

[yeah look forward to talking on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h14m15s)
02:14:15

[forums and see how everybody gets along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h14m17s)
02:14:17

[thanks everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0gmrXSXVg#t=02h14m19s)
