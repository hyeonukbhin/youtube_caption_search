[some of you have finished part 1 in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m00s)
00:00:00

[last few days some of you finished part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m03s)
00:00:03

[1 in December and I did ask both of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m05s)
00:00:05

[who took it in person to kind of revise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m09s)
00:00:09

[material and make sure it's up to date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m12s)
00:00:12

[but let's do a quick summary of the kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m14s)
00:00:14

[of key things reload and so I came up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m16s)
00:00:16

[with these five things now Institue here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m21s)
00:00:21

[if anybody has other key insights that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m24s)
00:00:24

[they kind of feel that they came away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m28s)
00:00:28

[from for the postings of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m29s)
00:00:29

[um stacks of nonlinear functions with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m34s)
00:00:34

[lots of wealth stacks of differentiable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m39s)
00:00:39

[nonlinear functions with lots of routers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m41s)
00:00:41

[of nearly any predictive modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m44s)
00:00:44

[program so when we say here or network a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m46s)
00:00:46

[lot of people are suggesting we should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m50s)
00:00:50

[use the phrase differentiable Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m51s)
00:00:51

[you know if you think about things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m55s)
00:00:55

[the collaborative filtering we did it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m57s)
00:00:57

[was really a couple of embeddings and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h00m59s)
00:00:59

[dot product and that gave us quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m01s)
00:01:01

[long way there's nothing very neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m03s)
00:01:03

[looking about that but we know that when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m06s)
00:01:06

[we stack certain kinds of nonlinear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m10s)
00:01:10

[functions on top of each other the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m13s)
00:01:13

[universal approximation theorem tells us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m15s)
00:01:15

[that can approximate any computable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m17s)
00:01:17

[function to arbitrary precision we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m20s)
00:01:20

[that if it's differentiable we can use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m23s)
00:01:23

[SGD to find the parameters which match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m25s)
00:01:25

[that function so this to me is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m29s)
00:01:29

[like the key insight um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m32s)
00:01:32

[some facts of functions are better than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m38s)
00:01:38

[others to some kind of data and some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m42s)
00:01:42

[kinds of problems one way to make life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m43s)
00:01:43

[very easy we learnt is transfer learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m47s)
00:01:47

[and I am I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m50s)
00:01:50

[really every Network we created in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m52s)
00:01:52

[last course which is transfer learning a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m56s)
00:01:56

[big 60 division and in text so pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h01m59s)
00:01:59

[much everything so transfer learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m03s)
00:02:03

[generally was always last layer replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m05s)
00:02:05

[it with a new one that has the right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m09s)
00:02:09

[number of outputs pre compute the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[penultimate layers output then very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m14s)
00:02:14

[quickly create a linear model that goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m17s)
00:02:17

[from that to your for your preferred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m19s)
00:02:19

[answer you now have something that works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m22s)
00:02:22

[pretty well and then you can fine tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m24s)
00:02:24

[more and more layers backwards as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m27s)
00:02:27

[necessary and we learnt that fine tuning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m29s)
00:02:29

[those additional layers generally the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m32s)
00:02:32

[best way to do that was to pre-compute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m34s)
00:02:34

[the last of the layers that you're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m36s)
00:02:36

[fine-tuning and so then you could just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m38s)
00:02:38

[calculate the whack to the remaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m41s)
00:02:41

[ones that papers large amount of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m43s)
00:02:43

[and remember that CN n layer up in in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[layers convolutional layers that mean to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m50s)
00:02:50

[say complex are slower so then it picked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[up the previous one as well stack of if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h02m58s)
00:02:58

[the wrench she at all nonlinear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m01s)
00:03:01

[all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m09s)
00:03:09

[I'm convolutional layers of slower dense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m11s)
00:03:11

[layers are bigger and there's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m15s)
00:03:15

[interesting question I've added here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[which is we remember remember in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m20s)
00:03:20

[last lesson we kind of looked at red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[snapped and infection apps and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m25s)
00:03:25

[general more modern nets can not have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[any gameplay so what's the best way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m29s)
00:03:29

[do transfer learning I'm gonna leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m34s)
00:03:34

[that as an open question for now we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m36s)
00:03:36

[going to look into it a bit during the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m38s)
00:03:38

[class but it's not a question that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m39s)
00:03:39

[anybody has answered to my photo session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m41s)
00:03:41

[blast-jet some ideas that no one's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m43s)
00:03:43

[really no one's even written a paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[that attempts to address it as far as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m50s)
00:03:50

[I'm aware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m52s)
00:03:52

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m53s)
00:03:53

[so given we have transfer learning to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m55s)
00:03:55

[give us scale it's a long way the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h03m58s)
00:03:58

[thing we have to get us a long way is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m00s)
00:04:00

[try and create an architecture which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m02s)
00:04:02

[suits our problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m04s)
00:04:04

[both our data and our loss function so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m06s)
00:04:06

[for example if we have Auto correlated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[inputs so in other words each input is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m14s)
00:04:14

[related to the previous input so each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m17s)
00:04:17

[pixel is similar to the next door pixel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m19s)
00:04:19

[or a sound wave each sample is optimal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m21s)
00:04:21

[to the previous sample and something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m24s)
00:04:24

[like that that kind of data we can -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m26s)
00:04:26

[like to use CNM tour as long as it of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m29s)
00:04:29

[fixed size it's a sequence we like to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m31s)
00:04:31

[use an unerring anymore if it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m35s)
00:04:35

[categorical output we like to use a star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m37s)
00:04:37

[next or so there are ways we work of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m39s)
00:04:39

[tuning our architecture not so that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m42s)
00:04:42

[makes a possible result problem because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m44s)
00:04:44

[any any standard dense network can solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m47s)
00:04:47

[any problem but it affected a lot faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m51s)
00:04:51

[and a lot easier to train if you make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m54s)
00:04:54

[sure that your activation functions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h04m57s)
00:04:57

[your architecture booth the phone so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m01s)
00:05:01

[that is another thing I think we learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m04s)
00:05:04

[and something I hope that everybody can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m10s)
00:05:10

[narrate is the five steps to avoiding a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m13s)
00:05:13

[thing if you've forgotten them they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m17s)
00:05:17

[both here and discussed in more detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m19s)
00:05:19

[lesson trees get more data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m21s)
00:05:21

[thank you more data using data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m26s)
00:05:26

[augmentation is more generalizable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m27s)
00:05:27

[architectures that architecture that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m30s)
00:05:30

[generalize well and particularly we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m32s)
00:05:32

[looked at batch normalization use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[regularization techniques as few as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m37s)
00:05:37

[can because by definition they destroy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m41s)
00:05:41

[it in data and that will not particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m44s)
00:05:44

[using drop out and then finally if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m46s)
00:05:46

[have to we can look at reducing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m50s)
00:05:50

[complexity of the architecture so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m51s)
00:05:51

[general approach we we learnt this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m54s)
00:05:54

[absolutely key is first of all with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m57s)
00:05:57

[new problem start with a network that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h05m59s)
00:05:59

[too big it's not regular eyes that can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m02s)
00:06:02

[help us solve the problem even if it has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m07s)
00:06:07

[to overfit terribly if you can't do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m10s)
00:06:10

[is no point starting director eyes yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m13s)
00:06:13

[so we start out by trying to overfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m16s)
00:06:16

[terribly once we cut to the point that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m18s)
00:06:18

[we're getting 100% accuracy in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m20s)
00:06:20

[validation set terrible because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m22s)
00:06:22

[overfitting then we start going through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m23s)
00:06:23

[these steps until we get a nice balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m26s)
00:06:26

[okay so that's kind of the process that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m29s)
00:06:29

[we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m32s)
00:06:32

[and then finally we learnt about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m33s)
00:06:33

[embeddings as a technique to allow us to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m35s)
00:06:35

[use categorical data and specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m39s)
00:06:39

[the idea of using words all the idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m42s)
00:06:42

[using latent variables so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m47s)

00:06:53

[insights I prefer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h06m59s)
00:06:59

[did anybody have any other kind of key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m01s)
00:07:01

[takeaways that they think people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m05s)
00:07:05

[providing should think about or remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m07s)
00:07:07

[or things they found interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m11s)
00:07:11

[okay that's good if you come up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m14s)
00:07:14

[something but you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m16s)
00:07:16

[of one question and how does having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m20s)
00:07:20

[duplicates and training data affect the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m23s)
00:07:23

[model created and if you're using data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m25s)
00:07:25

[augmentation do you end up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m28s)
00:07:28

[duplicate data just look at the input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m30s)
00:07:30

[data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m35s)
00:07:35

[I mean it's not a big deal right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m38s)
00:07:38

[we agree shuffle the batch and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m40s)
00:07:40

[select them you know randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m42s)
00:07:42

[effectively you're you're waiting that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m44s)
00:07:44

[data point higher than its neighbors so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m47s)
00:07:47

[in a big data set is then they prayers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[or difference if you've got one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m52s)
00:07:52

[repeated a thousand times and then if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m54s)
00:07:54

[any another 100 data points that can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m56s)
00:07:56

[a big problem because you're waiting one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m58s)
00:07:58

[second point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[so as you will have seen we've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m05s)
00:08:05

[couple of big technology foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m08s)
00:08:08

[changes the first one is we're moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m11s)
00:08:11

[from Python to to Python 3 - 2 I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[is a good place to start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m17s)
00:08:17

[even that a lot of the folks in part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m19s)
00:08:19

[had never coded in place and before and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m21s)
00:08:21

[many of them had never written you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m24s)
00:08:24

[very substantial pieces of software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[before and a lot of the tutorials out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[there like example one of our first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m33s)
00:08:33

[static points which is a limb flatten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m35s)
00:08:35

[the hard way and platon tool or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m37s)
00:08:37

[existing clothes out their apartment -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m40s)
00:08:40

[so if a person chooses the classes that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m41s)
00:08:41

[yesterday have two more questions one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m43s)
00:08:43

[are you going to post the slides after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m46s)
00:08:46

[this I will press the slide yet and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m48s)
00:08:48

[other is could you go through steps for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[underfitting at some point give this as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m52s)
00:08:52

[far over that or you know how to deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m55s)
00:08:55

[with overfit yeah let's do that in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m57s)
00:08:57

[forum thread so why don't you create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h08m59s)
00:08:59

[forum thread asking about underfitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m00s)
00:09:00

[comp if you don't need to do that in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m02s)
00:09:02

[plateau forum you could do that in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m04s)
00:09:04

[in the main forum because the pops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m06s)
00:09:06

[people will be interested caring about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m08s)
00:09:08

[that if you want to revise that lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m10s)
00:09:10

[train started by talking about unfitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m13s)
00:09:13

[okay so that seemed like a good place to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m20s)
00:09:20

[start I don't think we should keep using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m23s)
00:09:23

[plasm shoe though for a number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m25s)
00:09:25

[reasons one is that since then the ice -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[folks have come out and said that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m30s)
00:09:30

[next version won't be compatible with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m32s)
00:09:32

[platon - so that's a problem indeed from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m33s)
00:09:33

[2020 onwards pleasantry will be end of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[life which means there won't be patches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m40s)
00:09:40

[or so that's at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m43s)
00:09:43

[also we're going to be doing more stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[with concurrency and parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m46s)

00:09:48

[the features in packs of three a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m50s)
00:09:50

[better and then pison 3.6 is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[released which has some very nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m56s)

[features in particular so being format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m57s)
00:09:57

[in which some people it's no big deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h09m59s)
00:09:59

[but to me it saves a lot of time and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h10m01s)
00:10:01

[next life a lot easier so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h10m03s)
00:10:03

[move across the class and three and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h10m05s)
00:10:05

[there are hopefully you've all gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h10m07s)

00:10:33

[better starting points that have a much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h10m37s)

[stuff which just in the last few weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h11m12s)

[you'd wrinkle for tensorflow dev summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m01s)

[videos you can watch the videos about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m03s)
00:12:03

[all this and perhaps the most exciting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m05s)
00:12:05

[thing for us is that they are really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m07s)
00:12:07

[investing in a simplified API so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m09s)
00:12:09

[look at this code you can create a deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[neural network regressor on a mixture of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m16s)

[categorical and real variables using a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m21s)
00:12:21

[kind of almost our like syntax and fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m24s)
00:12:24

[it in two lines of code and you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m27s)
00:12:27

[that those lines of code at the bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m30s)
00:12:30

[the two lines to fit us look very much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[like Paris France wash away the carrot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m34s)

[Google and in fact everywhere we saw at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m39s)

[the best climate was care up API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m42s)
00:12:42

[influences so tensorflow and Cara are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m46s)
00:12:46

[kind of becoming more and more one which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m49s)

[is terrific so one is that they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m53s)
00:12:53

[really investing in the API a second is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m55s)
00:12:55

[that some of the tooling is looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h12m58s)

[pretty good so Kent the board has come a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m00s)

00:13:12

[of gravy and saturation in a layer you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[my favorite talks actually this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m24s)

[and his signature was an emoji of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m29s)

[ban corrected if you watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m43s)
00:13:43

[you kind of had to walk through showing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m47s)
00:13:47

[some of the functionality that's there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m49s)
00:13:49

[and how to use it and I thought that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m50s)
00:13:50

[pretty helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m52s)
00:13:52

[um one of the most important ones to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m55s)
00:13:55

[is that tensorflow has a great story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h13m58s)
00:13:58

[about production ization and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m01s)
00:14:01

[part one and I didn't much care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m03s)
00:14:03

[production ization it was really about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m04s)
00:14:04

[like playing around what we can what can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m06s)
00:14:06

[we learn so at this point I think we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m09s)
00:14:09

[might be starting to think about how do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m12s)
00:14:12

[I get my stuff online in front of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m13s)

[customers and these points are talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m16s)
00:14:16

[about something particular called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m19s)
00:14:19

[tensorflow serving and tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m21s)
00:14:21

[serving is the system that can take your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m23s)
00:14:23

[brain tends to flow model and create an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m25s)
00:14:25

[API for it which does some pretty cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m28s)
00:14:28

[things for example think about how hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m32s)
00:14:32

[it would be without the help of some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m35s)
00:14:35

[library to productionize your system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m38s)
00:14:38

[you've got one request coming in at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[time you've got an GPUs how do you make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m43s)
00:14:43

[sure that you don't saturate all those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m47s)
00:14:47

[GPUs if you send the request to one it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m49s)
00:14:49

[free if you don't give up all of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m51s)
00:14:51

[memory that is still how do you grab a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m53s)
00:14:53

[few requests put them into a batch put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[them in all to the GPU at once get a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m00s)
00:15:00

[out of the batch put them back to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m02s)
00:15:02

[people that requested it all that stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m03s)
00:15:03

[so serving does that for you it's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[early days for the software a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m09s)
00:15:09

[things don't work yet but you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m12s)
00:15:12

[download an early version and start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[playing with it I think that's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m18s)
00:15:18

[with the high level API and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m20s)
00:15:20

[tensorflow what's going to be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[difference between the Karis API and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m24s)
00:15:24

[tensorflow API yeah that's a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m26s)
00:15:26

[question check in fact the tensorflow or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m27s)
00:15:27

[TS Kaos will become a namespace so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m35s)
00:15:35

[carrots will become the official top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m39s)
00:15:39

[level API or is implode in fact make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m42s)
00:15:42

[sure was a person who announced that yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[I was just going to add that tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m47s)
00:15:47

[is kind of introducing I think a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m51s)
00:15:51

[different libraries at different layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m53s)
00:15:53

[kind of depend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m54s)
00:15:54

[write different levels as well as our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m55s)
00:15:55

[action so it's kind of like this it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m57s)
00:15:57

[concept of kind of an evaluation API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h15m59s)
00:15:59

[that appears everywhere is basically is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m02s)
00:16:02

[the carrots API hey there's a layers API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m05s)
00:16:05

[below yeah yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[so there's being mixed in lots of places](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m11s)
00:16:11

[so all the stuff you put that carrot is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m12s)
00:16:12

[going to be very helpful not just in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m16s)
00:16:16

[using carrots in sort of tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m18s)
00:16:18

[that in using tensorflow directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m19s)
00:16:19

[another interesting thing about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m24s)
00:16:24

[tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m26s)
00:16:26

[is that they've built a lot of cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[integrations where there is faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m29s)
00:16:29

[managers in distributed storage systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m31s)
00:16:31

[and stuff like that so it'll kind of fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m33s)
00:16:33

[into your production systems will neatly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m35s)
00:16:35

[use the data in whatever place authority](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m37s)
00:16:37

[is more neatly social data in s3 or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m40s)
00:16:40

[something like that you can general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m44s)

[intro Australian to sensor Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m46s)
00:16:46

[something I found very interesting is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m49s)
00:16:49

[that they announced a couple of weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m52s)

[ago a machine learning toolkit which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m55s)
00:16:55

[brings really high quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h16m57s)
00:16:57

[implementations of a wide variety of non](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m00s)
00:17:00

[deep learning algorithm temp to flow so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m03s)
00:17:03

[these all these are GPU accelerated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m05s)
00:17:05

[paralyzed skill and supported by Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[and so and like a lot of these have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m13s)
00:17:13

[lot of tech behind them so for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m16s)
00:17:16

[the random forest there's a paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m19s)
00:17:19

[actually called the tensor forests which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m21s)
00:17:21

[explains all of the interesting things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m23s)
00:17:23

[they did to create a fast GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m25s)

[of how to solve gradient saturation and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m34s)
00:17:34

[for flow tools I'm not sure that I will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m37s)
00:17:37

[we'll see how we go because I think the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m41s)

[the video from the dead summit which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m43s)

[that so I would say look at that first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m47s)
00:17:47

[and please do have questions and all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h17m50s)

[happen so I finally got it working by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m35s)
00:19:35

[switching to PI torch which we'll learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m40s)
00:19:40

[about doing but eventually going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m41s)
00:19:41

[start the first lesson was going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m44s)
00:19:44

[about neural translation and I put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m46s)
00:19:46

[back because tensorflow has just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[released a new system for our own ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m51s)
00:19:51

[which looks like it's going to make all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m54s)
00:19:54

[this lot easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m56s)
00:19:56

[so this is a exciting idea is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h19m57s)
00:19:57

[there's an API that allows us to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m00s)
00:20:00

[some pretty powerful RNN implementations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[and we're going to be absolutely needing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m06s)
00:20:06

[that when we learn to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m07s)
00:20:07

[translations oh yeah there is one more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m09s)
00:20:09

[again early days but there is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m13s)
00:20:13

[called excellet which is the accelerated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m16s)
00:20:16

[linear algebra neutral I think yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m19s)
00:20:19

[which is a system which takes tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m24s)
00:20:24

[code and compiled it and so for those of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[you that know something that tiling and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m34s)
00:20:34

[you know that a compilation you can do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m35s)
00:20:35

[lot of clever stuff in terms of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m37s)
00:20:37

[identifying their code or unrolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m40s)
00:20:40

[loops or accusing operations whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m43s)
00:20:43

[x-play tries to do all that now at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m46s)
00:20:46

[stage but takes your pencil flow code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[and turns it into machine code one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m51s)
00:20:51

[the cool things that that you do is run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m53s)
00:20:53

[it on a mobile phone with almost no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m55s)
00:20:55

[supporting libraries using native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h20m58s)
00:20:58

[machine instructions on that phone much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m01s)
00:21:01

[less memory but one of the really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[interesting discussions I had at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m07s)
00:21:07

[summit was with Scott Gray who some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m09s)
00:21:09

[you may have heard of he was the guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m12s)
00:21:12

[that actively accelerated neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m13s)
00:21:13

[kernels when he was at nirvana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m17s)
00:21:17

[he had like kernels that were two or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m20s)
00:21:20

[three times faster than invidious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m23s)
00:21:23

[kernels that doesn't know anybody else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m24s)
00:21:24

[in the world who knows more about neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m27s)
00:21:27

[network performance than him he told me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m29s)
00:21:29

[that he thinks that actually is a key to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m32s)
00:21:32

[creating a performant concise expressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m37s)
00:21:37

[neural network code and I really like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m42s)
00:21:42

[that idea the idea is currently if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m47s)
00:21:47

[look in the tensorflow code it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m49s)
00:21:49

[thousands and thousands of lines of C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m50s)
00:21:50

[all custom written the idea is you throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m53s)
00:21:53

[all that away in a place it with a small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m56s)
00:21:56

[number of lines attempt to flow code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h21m59s)
00:21:59

[that get compiled to your extra layer so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m00s)
00:22:00

[that's something that's actually got me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m03s)
00:22:03

[pretty excited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m05s)
00:22:05

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m08s)
00:22:08

[so tensorflow is pretty interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m12s)
00:22:12

[having said that it's kind of hideous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[the API is full of not invented here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m19s)
00:22:19

[syndrome it's clearly written by a bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m22s)
00:22:22

[of engineers to have not thoroughly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m27s)
00:22:27

[spent that much time learning about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m29s)
00:22:29

[user interface of api's it's full of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m32s)
00:22:32

[the Google isms in terms of having to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m36s)
00:22:36

[fit into their ecosystem but most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m40s)
00:22:40

[importantly it's still a kind of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m43s)
00:22:43

[siano you have to set up the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m48s)
00:22:48

[computation graph and then you kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m50s)
00:22:50

[go run which means if you want to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m52s)
00:22:52

[stuff in your computation graph that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m55s)
00:22:55

[involves like conditional Defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m57s)
00:22:57

[statement you know if this happens you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h22m59s)
00:22:59

[do this other part of a loop it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m01s)
00:23:01

[basically impossible direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m03s)
00:23:03

[um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m08s)
00:23:08

[so it turns out that there's a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m09s)
00:23:09

[different way of programming neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m14s)
00:23:14

[which is dynamic computation otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m17s)
00:23:17

[known as defined through run there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m21s)
00:23:21

[number of libraries to do this torch a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m24s)
00:23:24

[torch Dana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m26s)
00:23:26

[dinette they're the one that come to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m29s)
00:23:29

[mind and we're going to be looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m32s)
00:23:32

[one that was I won't say released but an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m36s)
00:23:36

[early version was put out about a month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m40s)
00:23:40

[ago called PI torch which I've started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m42s)
00:23:42

[rewriting a lot of stuff in and a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m47s)
00:23:47

[the more complex stuff just become](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m49s)
00:23:49

[suddenly so much easier and because it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m51s)
00:23:51

[becomes easier to do more complex things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m54s)
00:23:54

[I often find I can create faster and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h23m57s)
00:23:57

[more concise code by using this approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m01s)
00:24:01

[so even or by pi torch is very very very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m05s)
00:24:05

[new it is coming out of the same people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m08s)
00:24:08

[that built torch which really all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m12s)
00:24:12

[Facebook's systems they're on top of I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m14s)
00:24:14

[suspect that Facebook or in the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m17s)
00:24:17

[of moving across from watched apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m20s)
00:24:20

[torch and it's already full of credibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m21s)
00:24:21

[full stuff and as you'll see so we will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m25s)
00:24:25

[be using increasingly more and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m30s)
00:24:30

[apply towards during this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m32s)
00:24:32

[there is a question says pre compiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m37s)
00:24:37

[means that will write tensorflow code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m41s)
00:24:41

[and test it and then when we train a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m43s)
00:24:43

[model then we pre compile the code and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m46s)
00:24:46

[train our model yes so if we're talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m48s)
00:24:48

[about Excel a Excel a can be use number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m53s)
00:24:53

[of ways one is that you come up with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m55s)
00:24:55

[some different kind of different type of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h24m57s)
00:24:57

[kernels and different of factorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[something like that and arriving in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h25m03s)
00:25:03

[tensorflow you compile it with Excel a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h25m05s)
00:25:05

[and then you make it available to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h25m08s)
00:25:08

[anybody so when they use your layer you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h25m10s)
00:25:10

[know they're getting this compiled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h25m13s)

[actually show to clear that as well and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h26m43s)
00:26:43

[I think the reason is because it's so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h26m44s)
00:26:44

[big and complex it's so hard to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h26m46s)
00:26:46

[consists of defined by relative cement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h26m53s)

[it's way less optimization that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h26m56s)
00:26:56

[systems can do that attend aptly among](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h26m57s)
00:26:57

[the fastest because it's so easy to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m00s)
00:27:00

[write code is so much easier to write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m02s)
00:27:02

[good code so you know it's interesting I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m05s)
00:27:05

[think there's such different approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m09s)
00:27:09

[I think it's really great to know those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m12s)
00:27:12

[because there are going to be some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m14s)
00:27:14

[things are going to be fantastic and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[just a flow and something literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m17s)
00:27:17

[fantastic only they couldn't be more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m19s)
00:27:19

[different which is why I think there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m22s)
00:27:22

[two good things to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m24s)
00:27:24

[all right so they're wrapping up this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m27s)
00:27:27

[introductory part I wanted to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m31s)
00:27:31

[change your expectations about what how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[you've learnt so far to how we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m37s)
00:27:37

[to learn in the future what one to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m39s)
00:27:39

[was about showing your best practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m42s)
00:27:42

[right so genius like here's a library is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m43s)
00:27:43

[a problem you use these library and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m48s)
00:27:48

[these steps to solve this problem and do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m50s)
00:27:50

[it this way and what I behold we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m52s)
00:27:52

[this alternative cable home kitchen so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m54s)
00:27:54

[it was a tight race of selecting that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h27m58s)
00:27:58

[had best practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m01s)
00:28:01

[so you now know everything I know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m05s)
00:28:05

[best practices I didn't you know I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m07s)
00:28:07

[really have anything else to tell you so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m09s)
00:28:09

[we're now actually like stuff I haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m12s)
00:28:12

[quite figured out yet northern body else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m15s)
00:28:15

[but you probably need to know so some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[the for example like neural translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[that's example something that is solved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m26s)
00:28:26

[by a Google's Google solder but they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m30s)
00:28:30

[haven't released the way they solved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m33s)
00:28:33

[right so kind of the rest of us to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m34s)
00:28:34

[to put everything together and figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m36s)
00:28:36

[out how to make something work as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m38s)
00:28:38

[as Google made that work more often um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m40s)
00:28:40

[it's going to be um use the sequence the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m44s)
00:28:44

[thing that you can do that can get some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m48s)
00:28:48

[pretty good result here but there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m50s)
00:28:50

[thousand things you could do to make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m53s)
00:28:53

[better that no one's tried yet so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m54s)
00:28:54

[interesting or thirdly it could be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h28m58s)
00:28:58

[here's a sequence of things that solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m01s)
00:29:01

[this pretty well but gosh we wrote a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m03s)
00:29:03

[of custom clothes there didn't we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m06s)
00:29:06

[I'm sure this could be abstracted really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[nicely but no one has done that yet but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m11s)
00:29:11

[there's kind of three main categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m13s)
00:29:13

[and so generally at the end of each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m14s)
00:29:14

[class it won't be like ok that's it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m16s)
00:29:16

[that's how you do this thing it'll be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m18s)
00:29:18

[more like here are the things you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m20s)
00:29:20

[explore and so the kind of the homework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m22s)
00:29:22

[will be you know pick one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m25s)
00:29:25

[interesting things and dig into it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[generally speaking that homework will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m31s)
00:29:31

[get you to a point there hopefully no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m33s)
00:29:33

[one's done before or there's probably no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m36s)
00:29:36

[one's written down before I I found as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m38s)
00:29:38

[built this I think nearly every single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m41s)
00:29:41

[piece of code I'm presenting I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[unable to find anything online which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m49s)
00:29:49

[that thing correctly like there's often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m52s)
00:29:52

[example code it's claimed to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m55s)
00:29:55

[something like that but again again I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m57s)
00:29:57

[found that was missing huge pieces and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h29m59s)
00:29:59

[we'll talk about some of the things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m02s)
00:30:02

[you know it was missing as we go wonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m03s)
00:30:03

[a common one was it would only work on a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m06s)
00:30:06

[single item at a time it wouldn't work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m09s)
00:30:09

[with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m11s)
00:30:11

[- therefore the GPU is basically totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m11s)
00:30:11

[wasted or failed to get anywhere near](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[the performance that is claimed in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[paper that it was meant to be based on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m19s)
00:30:19

[so you know generally speaking there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[going to be lots of opportunities if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m26s)

[generally find that there probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m33s)
00:30:33

[there's no other post like that out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m35s)

[I'm not going back can we use tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m47s)
00:30:47

[and torch together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m50s)
00:30:50

[I don't think torched a PI torch torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m51s)
00:30:51

[is very similar but it's written in Lua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m55s)

[which is a very small embedded language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h30m59s)

[very good for what it is but not very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m03s)

[good for what we want to do so pate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m07s)

[watch is kind of a port of torch into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m10s)

[use them together yeah sure you know but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m18s)
00:31:18

[we'll kind of see a bit of that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m21s)

00:31:31

[very different approaches you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m33s)

[you who have some money left over I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m43s)
00:31:43

[would strongly to jet building a box um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m46s)
00:31:46

[and the reason is just building a box is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m49s)
00:31:49

[because you're pinging 90 cents an hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m51s)
00:31:51

[for p2 I know a lot of you are spending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m55s)
00:31:55

[a couple hundred bucks a month on AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h31m59s)

[bills here is a box that cost $550 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h32m01s)

[will be about twice as fast as paycheck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h32m06s)
00:32:06

[so it it's just not good value in p2 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h32m11s)
00:32:11

[it's way slower and it needs to be so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h32m16s)
00:32:16

[and also building a box you know if one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h32m22s)

[recommendation a couple of points to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h32m42s)
00:32:42

[more RAM helps more than I think people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h32m47s)

[so I really think writing is a good idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h39m33s)
00:39:33

[in fact all of your projects I hope will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h39m37s)
00:39:37

[end up in at least one blog if you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h39m40s)
00:39:40

[have a blog medium comm is a great place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h39m43s)
00:39:43

[to write we would love to feature your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h39m46s)
00:39:46

[work on faster AI so you know tell us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h39m49s)
00:39:49

[about what we create you know we're very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h39m53s)
00:39:53

[keen for most people to get into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h39m56s)
00:39:56

[deep learning community so yeah when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h39m59s)
00:39:59

[write this stuff say hey you know I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m02s)
00:40:02

[the system stuff based on its course I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m04s)
00:40:04

[doing and guess what I've learnt and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m06s)
00:40:06

[here's what I've tried and use what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m08s)
00:40:08

[found out I put the code I'll get hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m09s)
00:40:09

[it's amazing like even I'm asked putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m12s)
00:40:12

[our little AWS setup scripts on github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m16s)
00:40:16

[for the MOOC Rachel had like a dozen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m20s)
00:40:20

[pull requests within a week with more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m23s)
00:40:23

[than that yes with all kinds of little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m27s)
00:40:27

[bits of like oh if you're on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[version of Mac it's on this special here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m31s)
00:40:31

[that's checked this out to make it work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[in Ireland as well as in America and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m35s)
00:40:35

[there's lots of stuff that you can do I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m40s)
00:40:40

[think the most important tip here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m43s)
00:40:43

[don't wait to be perfect before you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[start writing you know what was that tip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m48s)
00:40:48

[you told me Rachel you should think of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m52s)
00:40:52

[your target audience as the person who's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m55s)
00:40:55

[one step behind you or maybe your target](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m56s)
00:40:56

[audience is someone that's just working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h40m59s)
00:40:59

[through the part one milk right now yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m00s)
00:41:00

[so your target audience is not young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m02s)
00:41:02

[presenting exactly it's used to sonica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m05s)
00:41:05

[another thing that you would love to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m09s)
00:41:09

[have seen because there will be far more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m11s)
00:41:11

[people in that target audience than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m13s)
00:41:13

[Geoffrey Hinton target audience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m16s)
00:41:16

[okay how we going to find Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m20s)
00:41:20

[7:45 so this might be a good time for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m24s)
00:41:24

[okay well looks let's just get through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m26s)
00:41:26

[this and then we can get on to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m28s)
00:41:28

[initial so I've tried to lay out what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m30s)
00:41:30

[think will study in part two as I say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m34s)
00:41:34

[what I was planning and so quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m38s)
00:41:38

[recently to present today was a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m40s)
00:41:40

[translation and then two things happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[Google suddenly came up with a much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m46s)
00:41:46

[better RN and sequence of sequence API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m48s)
00:41:48

[and then also two to three weeks ago a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m51s)
00:41:51

[new paper came out for generative models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m55s)
00:41:55

[which totally changed everything so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h41m58s)
00:41:58

[that's why we've redone things and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m01s)
00:42:01

[starting with CNN generative models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m03s)
00:42:03

[today yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m05s)
00:42:05

[if things yes we have a question where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m06s)
00:42:06

[to find the current research papers okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m09s)
00:42:09

[we'll get to that for sure let's do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m12s)
00:42:12

[after everybody so giving the thing go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m15s)
00:42:15

[as planned there general kind of topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m19s)
00:42:19

[areas in part 2 will be CNN's and NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m23s)
00:42:23

[beyond certifications if you think about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m27s)
00:42:27

[it pretty much every with everything we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[did in plant one with classification or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m31s)
00:42:31

[a little bit of regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[we're going to now be talking more about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m37s)
00:42:37

[generative models little hard to exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m38s)
00:42:38

[define what I mean by generative model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m42s)
00:42:42

[but we're talking about creating an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m44s)
00:42:44

[image or creating a sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m46s)
00:42:46

[you know we're creating bigger output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m50s)
00:42:50

[okay so CN n see on classification so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m53s)
00:42:53

[generative models at CN n means the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h42m57s)
00:42:57

[thing that we could produce could be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m00s)
00:43:00

[picture showing this is where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[bicycle is which is where the person is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m04s)
00:43:04

[this is whether graphic that's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m06s)
00:43:06

[the segmentation or it could be tag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m07s)
00:43:07

[taking a black and white image and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m09s)
00:43:09

[turning it into a color image or taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m11s)
00:43:11

[a low-res division turning into a higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m13s)
00:43:13

[image or taking a photo and putting it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m14s)
00:43:14

[into a van Gogh or taking a photo and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m16s)
00:43:16

[turning it into a sentence describing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m20s)
00:43:20

[actually um NLP beyond classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[can be taking a english sentence and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m27s)
00:43:27

[turning it into french or taking an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m30s)
00:43:30

[english story and the question and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m32s)
00:43:32

[turning it into an answer of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m34s)
00:43:34

[question about a story at a chat box in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m37s)
00:43:37

[your name will be talking about how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m40s)
00:43:40

[deal with larger data sets so that both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m44s)
00:43:44

[means data sets with more things in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m46s)
00:43:46

[and data sets where the things are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m47s)
00:43:47

[bigger and then finally and something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m50s)
00:43:50

[I'm pretty excited about as I've done a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m53s)
00:43:53

[lot of work recently finding interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m54s)
00:43:54

[stuff about using deep learning for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m57s)
00:43:57

[structured data and for train theories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h43m59s)
00:43:59

[so for example we heard about fraud the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m02s)
00:44:02

[fraud is both of those things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[combines time theories of kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m07s)
00:44:07

[transaction histories and trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m08s)
00:44:08

[histories and structured data in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m09s)
00:44:09

[customer information traditionally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m12s)
00:44:12

[that's not being peppered with deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m14s)
00:44:14

[learning but I've actually found some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m16s)
00:44:16

[theta P are in on world-class approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m19s)
00:44:19

[to solving those big learning so I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m22s)
00:44:22

[really looking forward to sharing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m25s)
00:44:25

[with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m26s)
00:44:26

[okay so let's take a ten-minute four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m28s)
00:44:28

[eight minute break come back at 5:00 to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m33s)
00:44:33

[8:00 thanks very much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m35s)
00:44:35

[okay so we're going to learn about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m41s)
00:44:41

[idea of artistic style or neural style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m43s)
00:44:43

[transfer and the idea is that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m46s)
00:44:46

[going to take a photo and make it look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m48s)
00:44:48

[like it was painted in the style of some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m52s)
00:44:52

[painter so our inputs are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m54s)
00:44:54

[a photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h44m59s)
00:44:59

[and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m05s)
00:45:05

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m05s)
00:45:05

[I'm kind of call it well that's why else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m07s)
00:45:07

[and style and so these two things are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m18s)
00:45:18

[going to be combined together to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m27s)
00:45:27

[a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m29s)
00:45:29

[an image which is going to hopefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m32s)
00:45:32

[have the content of the photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m35s)
00:45:35

[not working and the style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m41s)
00:45:41

[at the image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m51s)
00:45:51

[um so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m54s)
00:45:54

[what are we going to do this is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m57s)
00:45:57

[going to assume that there is some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h45m59s)
00:45:59

[function where the inputs to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m02s)
00:46:02

[function are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m07s)
00:46:07

[the photo actually they're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m10s)
00:46:10

[the input to the function is going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m14s)
00:46:14

[there the photo the style image and some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[generated image that I've created and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m22s)
00:46:22

[that will return some number where this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m27s)
00:46:27

[function will be higher if the generated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[image really looks like this photo in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m35s)
00:46:35

[this style and lower if it doesn't so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m41s)
00:46:41

[we can create this lost function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m45s)
00:46:45

[basically says here's my generated image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m48s)
00:46:48

[and it returns back a number saying oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m50s)
00:46:50

[yes that generated image does look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m53s)
00:46:53

[that photo in that style then we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m55s)
00:46:55

[use FGD and we would use SGG not to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h46m58s)
00:46:58

[optimize the weights of a network we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m03s)
00:47:03

[would use fgt to optimize the pixel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m08s)
00:47:08

[values that the generated image that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m11s)
00:47:11

[would be using using it to try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m14s)
00:47:14

[optimize the value of this argument so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m18s)
00:47:18

[even quite done that before but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m22s)
00:47:22

[conceptually it's identical right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m24s)
00:47:24

[conceptually we can just find the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m26s)
00:47:26

[derivative of this function with respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m29s)
00:47:29

[to this input right and then we can try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m33s)
00:47:33

[and optimize that input which is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m37s)
00:47:37

[set of pixel values try and maximize the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m39s)
00:47:39

[function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m42s)
00:47:42

[so all we need to do is come up with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m44s)
00:47:44

[function come up with a function which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m48s)
00:47:48

[will tell us how much does some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m51s)
00:47:51

[generated image look like this photo in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m53s)
00:47:53

[this style and the way we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h47m57s)
00:47:57

[that step one is going to be very simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m01s)
00:48:01

[we're going to turn it into two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m03s)
00:48:03

[functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m04s)
00:48:04

[F content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m07s)
00:48:07

[we'll take the photo and the generated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m09s)
00:48:09

[image and that will tell us a bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m13s)
00:48:13

[number if the generated image looks more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m17s)
00:48:17

[like the photo if the content looks the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m20s)
00:48:20

[same and then there'll be a second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m23s)
00:48:23

[function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m25s)
00:48:25

[the final image and the generated image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m29s)
00:48:29

[and that will tell us the Ohio number if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m32s)
00:48:32

[this generated image looks like it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m36s)
00:48:36

[painted in the same style of the style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m39s)
00:48:39

[image we can just turn it into two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m41s)
00:48:41

[pieces and add them together so now we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m44s)
00:48:44

[need to kind of come up with these boom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m48s)
00:48:48

[now the first part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m52s)
00:48:52

[it's very easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m57s)
00:48:57

[um what's a way that we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h48m59s)
00:48:59

[function that returns a higher number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m04s)
00:49:04

[that generated image is more similar to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m08s)
00:49:08

[some photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m11s)
00:49:11

[we come up with a lock function do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m14s)
00:49:14

[oh you're really obvious one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m16s)
00:49:16

[the values of four pixels the values of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m22s)
00:49:22

[the pixels in the generative image the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m24s)
00:49:24

[mean squared error between them and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m27s)
00:49:27

[photo that mean squared error loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m30s)
00:49:30

[function would be one way of doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m34s)
00:49:34

[and part now the problem with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m36s)
00:49:36

[though is that as I start to turn it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m40s)
00:49:40

[into a van Gogh those pixel values are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m44s)
00:49:44

[going to change they're going to change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m48s)
00:49:48

[color because the Bank off might have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m49s)
00:49:49

[been a very blue looking van Gogh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m51s)
00:49:51

[they'll change the relationships to each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[other so it might you know the the might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[become a curve or you see a straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m57s)
00:49:57

[line so really the pixel wise mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h49m59s)
00:49:59

[squared error is not going to give us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m04s)
00:50:04

[many much freedom in trying to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m07s)
00:50:07

[something that still looks like a photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m10s)
00:50:10

[so here's an idea instead let's look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m13s)
00:50:13

[what the pixels but let's take those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m18s)
00:50:18

[pixels and stick them through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[pre-trained enn like bgg and let's look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[at like the fourth or fifth or eighth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[convolutional layers activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[remember back to those like that those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m35s)
00:50:35

[Matt Matt baler visualizations where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m37s)
00:50:37

[saw that the later layers kind of said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m40s)
00:50:40

[how much doesn't how much like doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m44s)
00:50:44

[Abel look like here or how much does it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m46s)
00:50:46

[look like afar how much does this look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[like the fur of a job right the later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m51s)
00:50:51

[layers who are dealing with bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m54s)
00:50:54

[objects and more kind of semantic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m56s)
00:50:56

[concepts so if we were to use a later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h50m59s)
00:50:59

[layers activations as our loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m02s)
00:51:02

[then we could really change the style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m05s)
00:51:05

[and the color and all kinds of stuff and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[really would be saying just an eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m10s)
00:51:10

[don't look like an eye there's the big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m12s)
00:51:12

[still look like a big there's the rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m15s)
00:51:15

[still look like a rock and if the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m17s)
00:51:17

[is yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m19s)
00:51:19

[then okay that's good you know this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[something that matches in terms of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m23s)
00:51:23

[meaning of the content even though the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m25s)
00:51:25

[pixel look very different and so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m28s)
00:51:28

[exactly what we're going to do so the s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m30s)
00:51:30

[content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m32s)
00:51:32

[okay we're going to say that just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m35s)
00:51:35

[vgg activations of some convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m40s)
00:51:40

[layer which one we can trace them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m44s)
00:51:44

[that's actually enough for us to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m50s)
00:51:50

[started let's let's try and build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m52s)
00:51:52

[something that optimizes pixels using a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h51m55s)

[loss function of the vgg network some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h52m00s)

00:52:10

[and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h52m17s)
00:52:17

[um much of what we're going to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h52m19s)
00:52:19

[it's going to look very similar the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h52m22s)

[first thing you'll see which doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h52m24s)

[am immediately there looking at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h55m48s)

[references um the other thing you can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h55m50s)
00:55:50

[is that as you start reading the paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[as you can see my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h55m56s)
00:55:56

[my notes and highlights are saved and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h56m00s)

[devices than my other computers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h56m07s)

[so talking about archive is a great time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h56m11s)
00:56:11

[to answer a question we had earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=00h56m16s)

[that work is because it's doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h04m05s)
01:04:05

[something called broadcasting and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h04m07s)
01:04:07

[broadcasting refers to any kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h04m09s)
01:04:09

[operation where you have arrays tensors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h04m12s)

[and kind of how does that work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h04m25s)

[on to create a programming language to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h05m02s)

01:07:38

[tensor - a scaler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h07m42s)
01:07:42

[okay that makes perfect sense that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h07m44s)
01:07:44

[can subtract the scaler for another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h07m47s)
01:07:47

[one-dimensional tender okay but what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[it actually doing what it's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h07m51s)
01:07:51

[doing is taking this too and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h07m53s)
01:07:53

[replicating it three time for the sexing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h07m56s)
01:07:56

[element-wise one two three - two - two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[it is broadcasted the scalar is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m03s)
01:08:03

[broadcast to the scalar across the three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m08s)
01:08:08

[element better on - Ettore so here's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m12s)
01:08:12

[first example look forecasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m15s)
01:08:15

[so in general broadcasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m20s)
01:08:20

[has a very specific set of rules which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m25s)
01:08:25

[is this you can take two tenses and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m27s)
01:08:27

[first of all check the shorter tenth of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m34s)
01:08:34

[a tensor with less dimensions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m36s)
01:08:36

[prepend unit axes to the firm but I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m38s)
01:08:38

[when I take prepend unit axis is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m41s)
01:08:41

[example of pretending prepending unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m44s)
01:08:44

[active take the vector 2 3 and pre 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m46s)
01:08:46

[free unit axes on the front it is now a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m49s)
01:08:49

[four dimensional cancer of shape 1 1 1 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m53s)
01:08:53

[so if you turn a roll into a column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h08m57s)
01:08:57

[you're adding one unit masses if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m00s)
01:09:00

[then turning it into a single slice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m05s)
01:09:05

[you're adding another unit asset so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m08s)
01:09:08

[can always make something is where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m11s)
01:09:11

[higher dimensionality by adding unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m13s)
01:09:13

[acting so when you broadcast it takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m16s)
01:09:16

[the thing with west active just left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m20s)
01:09:20

[mentions and adds pre cleanse unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m23s)
01:09:23

[access to the phone and then what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m25s)
01:09:25

[does is it says so let's take the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m28s)
01:09:28

[example it's taken this thing which has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m31s)
01:09:31

[no axes as a scalar and turns it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m33s)
01:09:33

[vector of length well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m36s)
01:09:36

[and then what it does is it finds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m39s)
01:09:39

[anything which is at length 1 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m41s)
01:09:41

[duplicate it enough times so that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m44s)
01:09:44

[matches the other thing so here we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m48s)
01:09:48

[something which is a four dimensional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m51s)
01:09:51

[tensor of size 5 1 3 2 right so it's got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m52s)
01:09:52

[two columns three rows one slice and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h09m59s)
01:09:59

[five tubes coming and then we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m04s)
01:10:04

[to subtract from it a vector of length 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m09s)
01:10:09

[so remember from our definition it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[then going to automatically reshape this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m15s)
01:10:15

[by prepending unit axes interrupt the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[same length and then it's going to copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m25s)
01:10:25

[this thing three times this thing one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m29s)
01:10:29

[time and this thing five times so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m33s)
01:10:33

[shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m38s)
01:10:38

[is five one three two that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m41s)
01:10:41

[subtract this vector from every row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m45s)
01:10:45

[every slice every cube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m48s)
01:10:48

[so you can play around with these for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m54s)
01:10:54

[broadcasting examples and later I had to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h10m58s)
01:10:58

[get a real feel for how to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m01s)
01:11:01

[broadcasting work for you so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m03s)
01:11:03

[case we were able to take a four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m05s)
01:11:05

[dimensional sensor and subtract from it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m08s)
01:11:08

[a three dimensional vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m11s)
01:11:11

[knowing that it is going to copy that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m13s)
01:11:13

[three dimensional vector channel to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m15s)
01:11:15

[every row every column to every batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m18s)
01:11:18

[it's really and it's like it's just done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m22s)
01:11:22

[what we mean okay it subtracted the mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m25s)
01:11:25

[average of the channels from all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m29s)
01:11:29

[images the way we wanted it to but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m32s)
01:11:32

[been amazing how often I've taken code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m36s)
01:11:36

[that I've downloaded off the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m38s)
01:11:38

[and made it often ten or twenty times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m40s)
01:11:40

[smaller in terms of lines of code just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m44s)
01:11:44

[by using what the broadcasting and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m47s)
01:11:47

[reason I'm talking about this now is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m49s)
01:11:49

[because we're going to be using this a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m51s)
01:11:51

[lot right play with it and as I say if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m52s)
01:11:52

[you really want to have fun play with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m56s)
01:11:56

[and Jay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h11m58s)
01:11:58

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m00s)
01:12:00

[was a diversion that it's one that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m02s)
01:12:02

[going to be important throughout it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m04s)
01:12:04

[so we've now basically got the data that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m06s)
01:12:06

[we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m12s)
01:12:12

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m14s)
01:12:14

[next thing we need is a BJJ model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m16s)
01:12:16

[here's the thing though when we're doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m21s)
01:12:21

[generative models we want to be very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m24s)
01:12:24

[careful of throwing away information and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m26s)
01:12:26

[one of the main ways to throw away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[information is to use max tooling when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m32s)
01:12:32

[you use max pooling that they - comma -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m35s)
01:12:35

[max falling you're throwing away 3/4 of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m38s)
01:12:38

[the previous layer and just keeping the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m41s)
01:12:41

[highest one in generative models when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m42s)
01:12:42

[you use something like max pooling you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m47s)
01:12:47

[make it very hard to undo that and get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m50s)
01:12:50

[back the original data so if we were to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m53s)
01:12:53

[use max pooling with this idea of our s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h12m57s)
01:12:57

[content right and we say oh what if the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m00s)
01:13:00

[fourth layer of activations look like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m03s)
01:13:03

[we've used max pooling then we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[really know what 3/4 of data will player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m09s)
01:13:09

[slightly better is to use average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m13s)
01:13:13

[pooling that if max pooling at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m17s)
01:13:17

[with average pooling we're using all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m19s)
01:13:19

[the data to create an average we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m21s)
01:13:21

[still kind of thrown away recorded loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m23s)
01:13:23

[it at least have all been incorporated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m26s)
01:13:26

[into calculating the average so the only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m29s)
01:13:29

[thing I did to turn zgg 16 into vgg 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m33s)
01:13:33

[average just to do a search in replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m36s)
01:13:36

[in that file from max pooling - Arabs or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m38s)
01:13:38

[and it's just going to give us some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m41s)
01:13:41

[slightly smoother slightly nicer results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m43s)
01:13:43

[and you're going to see this a lot with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m46s)
01:13:46

[generative models we do little twigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m48s)
01:13:48

[just to try to make is to try to lose as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m50s)
01:13:50

[little information okay you can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m53s)
01:13:53

[think of this as bgg 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m56s)
01:13:56

[shouldn't we use something like ResNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[instead of bgg since the residual blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m00s)
01:14:00

[carry more context um we'll look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m03s)
01:14:03

[using ResNet over the coming weeks it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m07s)
01:14:07

[it's a lot harder to use Reds net for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m13s)
01:14:13

[anything beyond kind of basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m19s)
01:14:19

[classification pictures or for a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m22s)
01:14:22

[of reasons one is that just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m25s)
01:14:25

[structure of ResNet blocks is much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m28s)
01:14:28

[complex so if you're not careful you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m30s)
01:14:30

[going to end up picking something that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m33s)
01:14:33

[on one of those like little arms of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m35s)
01:14:35

[rest net rather than one of the additive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m37s)
01:14:37

[edges of the rest net and it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m39s)
01:14:39

[not going to give you any meaningful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m41s)
01:14:41

[information you also have to be careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m43s)
01:14:43

[because the resident blocks most of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m46s)
01:14:46

[time are just slightly fine-tuning their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m49s)
01:14:49

[previous block in other adding the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m52s)
01:14:52

[residuals it's not really adding new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m54s)
01:14:54

[types of information so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h14m58s)
01:14:58

[honestly the truth is I haven't seen any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m02s)
01:15:02

[good research at all about how to use or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m05s)
01:15:05

[where to use resonate or inception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m09s)
01:15:09

[architectures for things like generative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[models or for transfer learning or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m15s)
01:15:15

[anything like that so we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m17s)
01:15:17

[trying to look at some of that stuff in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m18s)
01:15:18

[this course but it's far from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m19s)
01:15:19

[straightforward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[two more questions and should we put in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m22s)
01:15:22

[batch normalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m24s)
01:15:24

[um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m27s)
01:15:27

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m27s)
01:15:27

[so in hidden thought one of the cause I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m30s)
01:15:30

[never actually added batch norm to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m33s)
01:15:33

[convolutional part of the model so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m35s)
01:15:35

[kind of irrelevant because we're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m38s)
01:15:38

[using a fully connected layer more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m40s)
01:15:40

[generally is batch normal helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m43s)
01:15:43

[generative models I'm not sure that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m46s)
01:15:46

[have a great answer to that Hey well the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m48s)
01:15:48

[pre-trained weights change if we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m52s)
01:15:52

[using average pooling instead of max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[pool yeah that's a great question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m56s)
01:15:56

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h15m58s)
01:15:58

[the pre-trained weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m00s)
01:16:00

[then clearly the optimal weights would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m04s)
01:16:04

[change but having said that it's still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m06s)
01:16:06

[going to do a reasonable job without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m09s)
01:16:09

[tweaking the weights because the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m11s)
01:16:11

[relationships between the activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m14s)
01:16:14

[isn't going to change so again this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m16s)
01:16:16

[would be an interesting thing to try if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m21s)
01:16:21

[you want to download image net and try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m23s)
01:16:23

[fine-tuning it with average pooling see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m25s)
01:16:25

[if you can actually see a difference in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[the output or not not something I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m29s)
01:16:29

[tried it ok so here is the output tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m32s)
01:16:32

[of one of the late players of BT g60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m38s)
01:16:38

[so the the way that if you remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m44s)
01:16:44

[there are different blocks of H a G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m47s)
01:16:47

[where there's a number of 3 by 3 columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m49s)
01:16:49

[in a row and then there's a polling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m52s)
01:16:52

[layer and then there's another block the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m54s)
01:16:54

[3 by 3 common Apollinaire so this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[last block of the comp players and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h16m58s)
01:16:58

[is the first column of that block so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m02s)
01:17:02

[this is maybe like the third last layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m04s)
01:17:04

[of the convolutional section of vgg so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m07s)
01:17:07

[this is kind of like quite receptive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m09s)
01:17:09

[field very kind of complex concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m11s)
01:17:11

[being captured and at this late stage so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[going to do is we need to create our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m22s)
01:17:22

[target so for our crowd bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m26s)
01:17:26

[when we put that bird through dgg what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m32s)
01:17:32

[is the value of that layers activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[so what other things that the gesture to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m39s)
01:17:39

[revise was the stuff from the Karis FAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m42s)
01:17:42

[about how to get layer outputs one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m45s)
01:17:45

[simple way to do that is to create a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m49s)
01:17:49

[model which checks our models input as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m51s)
01:17:51

[input and instead of creating using the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[final output as output we can use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m57s)
01:17:57

[layer as output but this is now a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h17m59s)
01:17:59

[which when we call dot predict it will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m01s)
01:18:01

[return this set of activation all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m04s)
01:18:04

[sewed up all we've done here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m09s)
01:18:09

[now we're going to be using this inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m12s)
01:18:12

[inside the GPU we're going to be using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m17s)
01:18:17

[this at the target](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m19s)
01:18:19

[so to give us something which is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m20s)
01:18:20

[to live in the GPU a and B we can use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m23s)
01:18:23

[symbolically in a computation graph B we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m26s)
01:18:26

[wrap it with K dot variable so to remind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m30s)
01:18:30

[you K so whatever clear up in the docs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m35s)
01:18:35

[they use the care of back end module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m41s)
01:18:41

[they always call it capital K I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m44s)
01:18:44

[know what so k refers to the API that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m47s)
01:18:47

[kiosk provides which finds a way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m51s)
01:18:51

[talking to either CRO or tensorflow with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m56s)
01:18:56

[the same API that so both Theano intend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h18m59s)
01:18:59

[to flow hyper-competitive variables and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m02s)
01:19:02

[placeholders and that functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m04s)
01:19:04

[detection functions and softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m07s)
01:19:07

[activation and so forth and so this K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m09s)
01:19:09

[dot module is where all of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m12s)
01:19:12

[functions live but this is just a way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m16s)
01:19:16

[creating a variable which is using Giano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m18s)
01:19:18

[okay Theano variable for using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m20s)
01:19:20

[tensorflow accredited to flow through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m23s)
01:19:23

[and where possible I'm trying to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m24s)
01:19:24

[this rather than tensorflow directly but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m28s)
01:19:28

[I could have absolutely have said the F](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m32s)
01:19:32

[variable and it would work just as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m34s)
01:19:34

[because we're using the temp to plug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m36s)
01:19:36

[back in okay so this is now created a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m37s)
01:19:37

[symbolic variable that contains the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m42s)
01:19:42

[activations of block five on one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m44s)
01:19:44

[so what we now want to do is to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m49s)
01:19:49

[degenerative image which we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m52s)
01:19:52

[use FGD to gradually make the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m55s)
01:19:55

[activations of that image look more and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h19m58s)
01:19:58

[more like it's variable so how are we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[going to do that let's just skip over to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m04s)
01:20:04

[our to for a moment and think about them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m06s)
01:20:06

[impedance so we're going to need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m08s)
01:20:08

[define a loss function and the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m11s)
01:20:11

[function is just the mean squared error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m13s)
01:20:13

[between two things one thing is of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[course that target that thing we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m19s)
01:20:19

[created which is the value of our our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m21s)
01:20:21

[our layer using the third image so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m27s)
01:20:27

[use the third image red okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m32s)
01:20:32

[our target and then what are we going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m36s)
01:20:36

[get close to that but what we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m39s)
01:20:39

[get close to that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m41s)
01:20:41

[whatever the value is of that layer at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m45s)
01:20:45

[the moment so what is layer equal the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m48s)
01:20:48

[layer is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m50s)
01:20:50

[a symbolic object this state there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m54s)
01:20:54

[nothing in it so we're going to have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m56s)
01:20:56

[feed it with data later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h20m58s)
01:20:58

[so we can so remember this is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m03s)
01:21:03

[the interesting way you define](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m04s)
01:21:04

[computation graphs with tensor flow and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m07s)
01:21:07

[theano is like you define it with these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m09s)
01:21:09

[symbolic thing now and you feed it with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m12s)
01:21:12

[data later we've got the symbolic thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m14s)
01:21:14

[called layer and we can't actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m16s)
01:21:16

[calculate this again so this stage this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m19s)
01:21:19

[is just a computation graph we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m21s)
01:21:21

[building now of course anytime you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m23s)
01:21:23

[a computation graph we can get its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m25s)
01:21:25

[gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m27s)
01:21:27

[that's a given I should read it the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m28s)
01:21:28

[question for readability can you scroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m32s)
01:21:32

[down when you're going over code snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m34s)
01:21:34

[so that they're centered yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m36s)
01:21:36

[thank you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m40s)
01:21:40

[okay so now that we have a computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m43s)
01:21:43

[graph that calculates the loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m47s)
01:21:47

[we're interested in this is this is f](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m48s)

[content if we're going to try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m50s)
01:21:50

[optimize our generative image we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m53s)
01:21:53

[going to need to know the gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m56s)
01:21:56

[alright so here we can get the gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h21m57s)
01:21:57

[and again we use K dot gradient rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m00s)
01:22:00

[than in terms of flow gradients or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m02s)
01:22:02

[are no gradient just so that it's we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m04s)
01:22:04

[use it with any back-end we like see so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m06s)
01:22:06

[the things that the function we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m11s)
01:22:11

[trying to get gradients on is the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m12s)
01:22:12

[function which we just calculated and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m14s)
01:22:14

[then we want it with respect to not some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m16s)
01:22:16

[ways that with respect to the input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m20s)
01:22:20

[that's a model right so this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m22s)
01:22:22

[thing that we want to change is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m24s)
01:22:24

[input to the model so as to minimize our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m26s)
01:22:26

[loss and so they're the gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m30s)
01:22:30

[so now that we've done that we can go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m34s)
01:22:34

[ahead and create our function and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m37s)
01:22:37

[input to the function is just modeled or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m40s)
01:22:40

[input and the output to the function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m42s)
01:22:42

[will be the loss and the gradients so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m45s)
01:22:45

[that's nearly everything we need the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m49s)
01:22:49

[last step we need to do is to actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m52s)
01:22:52

[run an optimizer now normally when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m54s)
01:22:54

[run an optimizer where you use some kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h22m58s)
01:22:58

[of SGD now the s and SGD is both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m00s)
01:23:00

[stochastic in this case there's nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m05s)
01:23:05

[stochastic we're not creating lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[random batches and getting different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m11s)
01:23:11

[gradients every time but why use to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m13s)
01:23:13

[catch the gradient percent when we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m17s)
01:23:17

[have a stochastic problem to solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m19s)
01:23:19

[so in fact there's a much longer history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m22s)
01:23:22

[of optimization methods which are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m25s)
01:23:25

[deterministic going back to Newton's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m28s)
01:23:28

[method which many of you will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m30s)
01:23:30

[familiar with so the basic idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m32s)
01:23:32

[I will current cover and the basic idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m37s)
01:23:37

[of the much faster deterministic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m42s)
01:23:42

[optimization method is that rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m47s)
01:23:47

[saying okay where's the gradient which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m49s)
01:23:49

[direction to the goal let's just go a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m52s)
01:23:52

[small little step in that direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m54s)
01:23:54

[the learning rate and spraying it's more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m56s)
01:23:56

[little step smaller because I have no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h23m58s)
01:23:58

[idea how far to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m00s)
01:24:00

[right and it's stochastics are going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m02s)
01:24:02

[keep changing the next time I log will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m04s)
01:24:04

[be a slightly different direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m06s)
01:24:06

[instead with a deterministic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m08s)
01:24:08

[optimization we find out which direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m10s)
01:24:10

[to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m13s)
01:24:13

[and then we find out what is the optimum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m14s)
01:24:14

[distance to go in that direction and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m17s)
01:24:17

[if you know this is the direction I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m20s)
01:24:20

[to go and it looks like this okay then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[the way we find the optimum is we go a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m24s)
01:24:24

[small distance then we go twice as far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m26s)
01:24:26

[as that twice as far as that tribe as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m29s)
01:24:29

[far as that and we keep going and chill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m31s)
01:24:31

[the slope changes sign and once the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m33s)
01:24:33

[slope changes sign we know we called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m37s)
01:24:37

[racketing is bracketed the minimum of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m39s)
01:24:39

[that function and then we can use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m42s)
01:24:42

[bisection to find the minimum so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m43s)
01:24:43

[we've added it we find halfway between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m45s)
01:24:45

[the two okay it's on the left or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m48s)
01:24:48

[right of that okay halfway between two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m50s)
01:24:50

[of those at the left or the right of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m52s)
01:24:52

[that so we use bracketing and bisection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m53s)
01:24:53

[to find the optimum in that direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h24m57s)
01:24:57

[let's call it a line search so all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[these optimization techniques rely on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m04s)
01:25:04

[the basic idea of a line search now once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m08s)
01:25:08

[you've done the mind search you found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m11s)
01:25:11

[the optimizer you found the optimal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m13s)
01:25:13

[value in that direction in our downhill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m15s)
01:25:15

[direction that doesn't necessarily mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m17s)
01:25:17

[we found the optimal value across our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m19s)
01:25:19

[entire space so what we then do is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m22s)
01:25:22

[repeat the process find out what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m25s)
01:25:25

[downhill direction now is line search to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m28s)
01:25:28

[find the optimum in that direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m30s)
01:25:30

[so the problem with that is that in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m33s)
01:25:33

[saddle point you will still often find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m39s)
01:25:39

[yourself going backwards and forward in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m41s)
01:25:41

[a rather unfortunate way so the meter or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m44s)
01:25:44

[the faster optimization approaches when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m50s)
01:25:50

[they're going to go in a new direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m54s)
01:25:54

[that I'll just say which direction is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m55s)
01:25:55

[down they say which direction is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m57s)
01:25:57

[most downhill but also is the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h25m59s)
01:25:59

[different to the previous direction but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m01s)
01:26:01

[one that's called finding a conjugate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m04s)

[direction so the good news is you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m06s)
01:26:06

[need to really know any of those details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m09s)
01:26:09

[all you need to know is that there is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m11s)

[they differ in the detail of how do they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[decide what direction to go in their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m42s)
01:26:42

[switch direction is both the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m44s)

[downhill and also the most different for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m46s)
01:26:46

[the previous directions we've gone and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m49s)
01:26:49

[the particular version we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m51s)

[use is a limited memory the APS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m53s)
01:26:53

[so the important thing is not how it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h26m57s)
01:26:57

[works the important thing for asked is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h27m03s)
01:27:03

[how do we use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h27m05s)

[all of the of the lost with respect to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h27m28s)

[someone asked of ant colony optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h27m42s)

[is something that can be sued and colony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h27m44s)
01:27:44

[optimization lives in the class known as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h27m49s)
01:27:49

[metaheuristics like genetic algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h27m51s)
01:27:51

[or simulated annealing it's a wide range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h27m55s)
01:27:55

[of optimization algorithms that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m00s)
01:28:00

[designed for very difficult to optimize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m02s)
01:28:02

[functions functions which are extremely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m05s)
01:28:05

[bumpy and so these are techniques or use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m07s)
01:28:07

[a lot of randomization in order to avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m11s)
01:28:11

[the bumps in our case we're using mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m16s)
01:28:16

[square error which is a nice smooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m19s)
01:28:19

[objective so we can use the much faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m22s)
01:28:22

[convex optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m25s)
01:28:25

[and then that was the next question is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m28s)
01:28:28

[this a non-convex problem or convex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m30s)
01:28:30

[optimization right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m34s)
01:28:34

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m40s)
01:28:40

[how do we use one of these optimizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m42s)
01:28:42

[well basically you provide the name of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m45s)
01:28:45

[the optimizer which in this case is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m48s)
01:28:48

[minimize something using the FPS and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m50s)
01:28:50

[have to pass it three things a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m54s)
01:28:54

[which will return the lost value at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h28m58s)
01:28:58

[current point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m02s)
01:29:02

[a starting point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m05s)
01:29:05

[and a function which will return the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m09s)
01:29:09

[gradients at the current point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m11s)
01:29:11

[now unfortunately we have a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m14s)
01:29:14

[which returns the lost and the gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m17s)
01:29:17

[together which is not what this one's so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m21s)
01:29:21

[a minor little detail is that we create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m25s)
01:29:25

[a simple little class okay and all this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m28s)
01:29:28

[class does and again the details really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m34s)
01:29:34

[aren't important but all this class does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m36s)
01:29:36

[is that when loss is called they call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m38s)
01:29:38

[that function that we created passing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m41s)
01:29:41

[the current value of the data it gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m45s)
01:29:45

[back the loss and the radiance and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m49s)
01:29:49

[returns the loss later on when the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m53s)
01:29:53

[optimizer asks for the gradient it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h29m57s)
01:29:57

[returns those gradients that door back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m00s)
01:30:00

[here so all this is doing is it the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m04s)
01:30:04

[little class which allows us to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m06s)
01:30:06

[basically turn a Karass function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m08s)
01:30:08

[returns the loss from the gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m11s)
01:30:11

[together into two function one return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m12s)
01:30:12

[loss one returns the gradients so it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m16s)
01:30:16

[pretty minor detail but it's a handy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m19s)
01:30:19

[thing to have in your toolbox because it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m21s)
01:30:21

[means you now have something that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m22s)
01:30:22

[use deterministic optimizers on Keros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m25s)
01:30:25

[functions so all we do is we live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m28s)
01:30:28

[through a small number of times causing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m32s)
01:30:32

[that calling that optimize each time and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m35s)
01:30:35

[passing in we need to pass in some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m38s)
01:30:38

[starting point so the starting point is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m42s)
01:30:42

[just a random image okay so we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m44s)
01:30:44

[create a random image and here is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m49s)
01:30:49

[oh and an image looks like okay so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m52s)
01:30:52

[go ahead and run that so we can see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h30m56s)
01:30:56

01:31:23

[okay so you can see you're cutting the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h31m29s)
01:31:29

[work going along and solving here here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h31m31s)
01:31:31

[one I prepared earlier and here at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h31m34s)
01:31:34

[end of the 10th iteration is the result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h31m37s)
01:31:37

[so remember what we did was we started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h31m42s)
01:31:42

[with this image okay we called an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h31m43s)

[optimizer which took that image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h31m49s)
01:31:49

[to optimize this log function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h31m54s)
01:31:54

[the target was the value of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h31m59s)
01:31:59

[this layer for a bird image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h32m03s)

01:33:03

[you can see it's looking getting the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m07s)
01:33:07

[details more correct so when we do our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m10s)
01:33:10

[artistic style we can choose which layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m12s)
01:33:12

[will be our F content right and if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m15s)
01:33:15

[choose an earlier one it's going to give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m17s)
01:33:17

[it less degrees of freedom to look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m19s)
01:33:19

[a different kind of bird but it's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m23s)

[to look more like our original bird and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m25s)
01:33:25

[feel free to borrow it it's very simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m53s)

[we actually use this in the last club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h33m57s)

[you just have to define a function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h34m07s)
01:34:07

[gets called at each step of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h34m09s)

01:36:30

[have to get a list of file names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m33s)
01:36:33

[yourself from the vista file to content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m36s)
01:36:36

[editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m42s)
01:36:42

[and then just to make sure I understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m44s)
01:36:44

[this and someone says in this example we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m46s)
01:36:46

[started with a random image but what if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m49s)
01:36:49

[we started with the actual image is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m51s)
01:36:51

[initial condition we would get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m53s)
01:36:53

[original image back right I'm gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m55s)
01:36:55

[students though yeah yeah I mean I can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h36m57s)
01:36:57

[see why I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m00s)
01:37:00

[that they basically the gradient will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m02s)
01:37:02

[zero they're interested to find out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m04s)
01:37:04

[where we initialize for the artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m07s)
01:37:07

[dialing problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m09s)
01:37:09

[just to follow up we're going to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m14s)
01:37:14

[there and throw oh there's one more okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m15s)
01:37:15

[and would it be useful to use a tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m19s)
01:37:19

[like quiver to figure out which bgg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m21s)
01:37:21

[layer to use this um it's so easy just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m23s)
01:37:23

[to try a few and see what works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m27s)
01:37:27

[okay so we're nearly out of time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m32s)
01:37:32

[let's um haven't got to as much as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m34s)
01:37:34

[hope that we're going to finish off this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m36s)
01:37:36

[piece so um we're now going to do F file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m38s)
01:37:38

[now F style is nearly identical all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m44s)
01:37:44

[the code is nearly identical the only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m47s)
01:37:47

[thing different is a we're going to not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m49s)
01:37:49

[feed in a photo they're going to feed in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m53s)
01:37:53

[a painting and here's a few styles we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m55s)
01:37:55

[could choose from we could do van Gogh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m57s)
01:37:57

[we could do the drawing or we could do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h37m58s)
01:37:58

[the sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m01s)
01:38:01

[now so we pick one of those and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m03s)
01:38:03

[create the style array in the same way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m06s)
01:38:06

[as before sound check it through vgg and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m09s)
01:38:09

[this time though we're going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m13s)
01:38:13

[multiple layers so I created a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m15s)
01:38:15

[dictionary from the name of the layer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m17s)
01:38:17

[it Apple and so we're going to use that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m19s)
01:38:19

[to create an array of a number of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m22s)
01:38:22

[outputs we're going to grab the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m29s)
01:38:29

[second and third block app words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m31s)
01:38:31

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m36s)
01:38:36

[so we're going to create our target as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m38s)
01:38:38

[before beverage use a different loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m42s)
01:38:42

[function the loss function is called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m47s)
01:38:47

[spyro watts and just like before it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m49s)
01:38:49

[going to use the MSE that rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m52s)
01:38:52

[just the MSC on the activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m55s)
01:38:55

[it's the MSC on something called the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m57s)
01:38:57

[gram matrix of the activation so what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h38m59s)
01:38:59

[the gray matrix a gram matrix is very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m02s)
01:39:02

[simply the dot product of a matrix with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m05s)
01:39:05

[its own transfer so here it is here dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m11s)
01:39:11

[product of unmei tricks with if there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m15s)
01:39:15

[are transfers and I just going to divide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m19s)
01:39:19

[it by Kiev Korean average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m21s)
01:39:21

[um so what is this matrix that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m24s)
01:39:24

[taking the dot product of it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m27s)
01:39:27

[transpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m29s)
01:39:29

[so what it is is that we start with our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m30s)
01:39:30

[image remember the image is height by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m33s)
01:39:33

[width by channel and we change the order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m35s)
01:39:35

[of dimension so it channels by height by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m38s)
01:39:38

[width](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m42s)
01:39:42

[and then we do a batch flatten or what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m43s)
01:39:43

[batch flatten does is it takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m46s)
01:39:46

[everything except the first dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m48s)
01:39:48

[and flattens it out into a vector so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m50s)
01:39:50

[this is now going to be a matrix where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m53s)
01:39:53

[the rows the channels and the columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m55s)
01:39:55

[are a flattened version of the height by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h39m58s)
01:39:58

[which factor this is Z by H by W the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m02s)
01:40:02

[result of this will be zeros and H times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m06s)
01:40:06

[W columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m09s)
01:40:09

[so when you take the dot product of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m12s)
01:40:12

[something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m14s)
01:40:14

[with the transpose of itself what you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m16s)
01:40:16

[basically doing is creating something a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m19s)
01:40:19

[lot like a correlation matrix right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m20s)
01:40:20

[you're saying how much is each row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m23s)
01:40:23

[similar to each other Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m27s)
01:40:27

[all right so if you think about a you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m30s)
01:40:30

[know you think it was a number of ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m34s)
01:40:34

[you can think about it like a cosine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m36s)
01:40:36

[cosine is basically just a dot product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m38s)
01:40:38

[you can think of it as a correlation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m40s)
01:40:40

[matrix is basically a normalized version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m46s)
01:40:46

[of this so maybe it's not clear to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m49s)
01:40:49

[write it down on a piece of paper on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m52s)
01:40:52

[way home tonight just think about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m54s)
01:40:54

[picking the rows of a matrix and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h40m55s)
01:40:55

[flipping it around and you're basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m00s)
01:41:00

[then turning them into columns and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m02s)
01:41:02

[you multiply the rows by the columns but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m04s)
01:41:04

[basically the same as taking each row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m07s)
01:41:07

[and comparing it to each other oh that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m09s)
01:41:09

[so that's what this gram matrix is is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m12s)
01:41:12

[it's basically saying for every channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m15s)
01:41:15

[how similar are its values to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m20s)
01:41:20

[channel so if channel number one in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m23s)
01:41:23

[most part of the image is very similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m28s)
01:41:28

[to channel 3 and most parts of the image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m31s)
01:41:31

[then 1 comma 3 if this result will be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m33s)
01:41:33

[higher number so if the kind of a weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m37s)
01:41:37

[matrix right it basically tells us it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m41s)
01:41:41

[like a fingerprint of how the channel to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m43s)
01:41:43

[elect or each other in this particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m47s)
01:41:47

[image or how the filters relate to each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m50s)
01:41:50

[other in a particular layer that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m52s)
01:41:52

[particular image may be the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m53s)
01:41:53

[important thing to recognize is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m56s)
01:41:56

[there is no geometry left here or that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h41m57s)
01:41:57

[the X and the y coordinates are totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m01s)
01:42:01

[drawn away like they're actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m04s)
01:42:04

[flattened down at to this last function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m06s)
01:42:06

[can by by definition in no way at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m09s)
01:42:09

[contain anything about the content of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m14s)
01:42:14

[the image because it's thrown away all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m16s)
01:42:16

[of the XY information and at all that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m18s)
01:42:18

[left is some kind of fingerprint of how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m21s)
01:42:21

[the channel selector each other at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m24s)
01:42:24

[filters relate to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m26s)
01:42:26

[so this style loss then says to the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m29s)
01:42:29

[different images how does these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m32s)
01:42:32

[fingerprints differ how similarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m34s)
01:42:34

[fingerprints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m37s)
01:42:37

[turns out that if you now do the exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m40s)
01:42:40

[thing sisters are for using that as our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m42s)
01:42:42

[log function and you run it through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m44s)
01:42:44

[few iterations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m47s)
01:42:47

[it looks like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m49s)
01:42:49

[it looks a lot like the original van](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m52s)
01:42:52

[Gogh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m56s)
01:42:56

[but without any of the content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h42m59s)
01:42:59

[so the question is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m03s)
01:43:03

[why the answer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m06s)
01:43:06

[nobody the not so a paper just came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m10s)
01:43:10

[out two weeks ago called the mystifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m15s)
01:43:15

[euro style transfer with a mathematical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m18s)
01:43:18

[treatment where they claim to have an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m21s)
01:43:21

[answer to this question but at the point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m22s)

[at which this was created by a year and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m25s)
01:43:25

[a half ago until now no one really knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m29s)
01:43:29

[why that happens right but the important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m33s)
01:43:33

[thing of the authors of this paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m36s)
01:43:36

[realized is if we can create a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m37s)
01:43:37

[that gives you a Content loss and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m41s)
01:43:41

[function that gives you spiral loss and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m43s)
01:43:43

[you add the two together and optimize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m45s)

[them you can do your style so all I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m46s)

[assume they don't see how to get in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m50s)
01:43:50

[paper all I can assume is that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m51s)
01:43:51

[tried a few different things they knew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m53s)
01:43:53

[that they had to throw away all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h43m55s)

01:44:01

[okay so now that we have this magical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m04s)

[thing there's a symptom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m08s)
01:44:08

[what we have to do is that the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m12s)
01:44:12

[together right so here's up there it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m14s)

[you provide the content lost by ten this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m42s)

[is something you can play with right in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m43s)
01:44:43

[the paper you'll see they play with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m45s)
01:44:45

[but it's like how much they lost this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m46s)
01:44:46

[how much fun checkmarks gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m49s)

[evaluator valvert and error and so other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h44m53s)
01:44:53

[than the fact that we don't really know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m00s)
01:45:00

[why the stylus works but it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m02s)
01:45:02

[everything else kind of fits together so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m04s)
01:45:04

[there's the bird as then Gogh is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m07s)
01:45:07

[bird is the Simpsons and there's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m09s)
01:45:09

[bird in the style of a barrage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m11s)
01:45:11

[soon and since the publication of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m16s)
01:45:16

[paper has anyone used any other lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m18s)
01:45:18

[functions for app style that achieve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m20s)
01:45:20

[similarity yeah so as I mentioned a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m23s)
01:45:23

[difficult weeks ago there was a paper I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m25s)
01:45:25

[put it on the forum that tries to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m27s)
01:45:27

[generalize this class function it turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m29s)
01:45:29

[out actually that this particular loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m32s)
01:45:32

[function seems to be about the best that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m34s)
01:45:34

[they can come up with but there you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m36s)
01:45:36

[so it's 9 o'clock and so we are have run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m38s)
01:45:38

[out of time so we're going to move some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m41s)
01:45:41

[of this lesson to next lesson but to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m44s)
01:45:44

[give you a sense of where we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m46s)
01:45:46

[head what we're going to do is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m47s)
01:45:47

[going to take this thing where you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m50s)
01:45:50

[to optimize every single image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m53s)
01:45:53

[separately and we're going to train the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m54s)
01:45:54

[CNN we're going to train at CNN which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h45m57s)
01:45:57

[will learn how to turn a picture into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m00s)
01:46:00

[van Gogh version of that picture that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m03s)
01:46:03

[that's basically going to be what we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m06s)
01:46:06

[going to learn that phone and we're also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m07s)
01:46:07

[going to learn about adversarial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m09s)
01:46:09

[networks which is where we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m10s)
01:46:10

[create two networks one will be designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m12s)
01:46:12

[to generate pictures like this and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m15s)
01:46:15

[other will be designed to train classify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m18s)
01:46:18

[whether this is a real Simpsons picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m22s)
01:46:22

[or a fake isn't and then you're through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m24s)
01:46:24

[one generate the other discriminate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m27s)
01:46:27

[generate discrimination and by doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m30s)
01:46:30

[that we can take any generative model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m31s)
01:46:31

[and make it better by basically having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m35s)
01:46:35

[something else learn to pick the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m39s)
01:46:39

[difference between the real and the fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m41s)
01:46:41

[and then finally we're going to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m43s)
01:46:43

[about a particular thing that came out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m46s)
01:46:46

[three weeks ago called the loss of sine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m47s)
01:46:47

[Gann which is the reason I actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m49s)
01:46:49

[decided to move us forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m52s)
01:46:52

[generative adversarial networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m53s)
01:46:53

[basically didn't work very well at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m55s)
01:46:55

[until about three weeks ago now that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h46m57s)
01:46:57

[they do work suddenly there's a shitload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h47m00s)
01:47:00

[of stuff that nobody's done yet which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h47m02s)
01:47:02

[you can do the first time so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h47m04s)
01:47:04

[to look at that next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRjPVN3oo4s#t=01h47m06s)
01:47:06
