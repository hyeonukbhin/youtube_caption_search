welcome back so we had a busy lesson
00:00:00.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m00s

last week and I was really thrilled to
00:00:05.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m05s

see actually one of our masters students
00:00:11.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m11s

here at USF actually actually took what
00:00:14.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m14s

we learned took what we learned with
00:00:18.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m18s

structured deep learning and turned it
00:00:23.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m23s

into a blog post which as I suspected
00:00:25.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m25s

has been incredibly popular because it's
00:00:28.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m28s

just something people didn't know about
00:00:30.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m30s

and so it actually ended up getting
00:00:33.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m33s

picked up by the towards data science
00:00:35.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m35s

publication which I quite liked actually
00:00:38.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m38s

if you're interested in keeping up with
00:00:40.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m40s

what's going on a data science it's
00:00:41.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m41s

quite good medium publication and so
00:00:43.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m43s

Karen talked about structured deep
00:00:46.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m46s

learning and basically introduced you
00:00:50.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m50s

know the the the basic ideas that we
00:00:53.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m53s

learned about last week and it got
00:00:55.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m55s

picked up quite quite widely one of the
00:00:58.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m58s

one of the things I was pleased to say
00:01:01.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m01s

actually sebastian ruder who actually
00:01:02.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m02s

mentioned in last week's class as being
00:01:04.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m04s

one of my favorite researchers tweeted
00:01:06.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m06s

it and then somebody from stitch fix
00:01:09.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m09s

said oh yeah we've actually been doing
00:01:11.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m11s

that for ages which is kind of cute I I
00:01:12.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m12s

kind of know that this is happening in
00:01:16.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m16s

industry a lot and I've been telling
00:01:18.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m18s

people this is happening in industry a
00:01:20.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m20s

lot but nobody's been talking about it
00:01:21.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m21s

and now the Karen's kind of published a
00:01:23.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m23s

blog saying hey check out this cool
00:01:24.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m24s

thing and they all stitch fixes like
00:01:26.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m26s

yeah we're doing that already so so
00:01:28.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m28s

that's been great great to see and I
00:01:30.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m30s

think there's still a lot more that can
00:01:34.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m34s

be dug into with this structured people
00:01:38.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m38s

learning stuff you know to build on top
00:01:39.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m39s

of Karen's post would be that maybe like
00:01:42.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m42s

experiment with some different datasets
00:01:44.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m44s

maybe find some old careful competitions
00:01:46.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m46s

and see like there's some competitions
00:01:48.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m48s

that you could now win with this or some
00:01:50.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m50s

which doesn't work for would be equally
00:01:53.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m53s

interesting and also like just
00:01:55.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m55s

experimenting a bit with different
00:01:58.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m58s

amounts of dropout different layer sizes
00:01:59.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m59s

you know because nobody much is written
00:02:01.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m01s

about this I don't think there's been
00:02:05.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m05s

any blog posts about this before that
00:02:07.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m07s

I've seen anywhere
00:02:09.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m09s

there's a lot of unexplored territory so
00:02:10.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m10s

I think there's a lot we could we could
00:02:13.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m13s

build on top of here and there's
00:02:16.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m16s

definitely a lot of interest as well one
00:02:17.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m17s

person on Twitter saying this is what
00:02:19.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m19s

I've been looking for for ages another
00:02:21.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m21s

thing which I was pleased to see is
00:02:25.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m25s

Nikki or who we saw his cricket versus
00:02:27.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m27s

baseball predictor as well as his a
00:02:31.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m31s

currency predictor after less than one
00:02:33.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m33s

went on to download something a bit
00:02:36.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m36s

bigger which was to download a couple of
00:02:40.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m40s

hundred of images of actors and he
00:02:43.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m43s

manually went through and checked which
00:02:46.459
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m46s

well I think first of all he like used
00:02:48.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m48s

Google to try and find ones with glasses
00:02:50.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m50s

and ones without then he manually went
00:02:52.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m52s

through and checked that that they put
00:02:53.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m53s

in the right spot and this was a good
00:02:55.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m55s

example of one where vanilla ResNet
00:02:57.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m57s

didn't do so well with just the last
00:03:00.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m00s

layer and so what Nikhil did was he went
00:03:01.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m01s

through and tried on freezing the layers
00:03:06.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m06s

and using differential learning rates
00:03:07.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m07s

and got up to a hundred percent accuracy
00:03:09.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m09s

and the thing I like about these things
00:03:11.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m11s

that Nikhil was doing is the way he's
00:03:14.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m14s

he's not downloading a kegel data set
00:03:15.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m15s

he's like deciding on a problem that
00:03:18.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m18s

he's going to try and solve he's going
00:03:20.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m20s

from scratch from google and he's
00:03:22.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m22s

actually got a link here even to the
00:03:24.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m24s

suggested way to help you download
00:03:26.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m26s

images from Google so I think this is
00:03:28.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m28s

great and actually gave a talk just this
00:03:30.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m30s

afternoon at singularity University to
00:03:33.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m33s

an executive team of one of the world's
00:03:36.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m36s

largest telecommunications companies and
00:03:38.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m38s

actually show them this post because the
00:03:40.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m40s

folks there were telling me that that
00:03:43.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m43s

all the vendors that come to them and
00:03:46.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m46s

tell them they need like millions of
00:03:47.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m47s

images and huge data centers will have
00:03:50.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m50s

hardware and you know they have to buy a
00:03:52.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m52s

special software that only these vendors
00:03:53.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m53s

can provide and I said like actually
00:03:56.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m56s

this person has been doing it of course
00:03:58.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m58s

for three weeks now and look at what
00:04:00.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m00s

he's just done with a computer that cost
00:04:01.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m01s

him 60 cents an hour and they were like
00:04:04.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m04s

they were so happy to hear that like
00:04:06.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m06s

okay they're you know this actually is
00:04:08.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m08s

in the reach of normal people I'm
00:04:11.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m11s

assuming Nikhil is a normal person I
00:04:13.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m13s

haven't actually
00:04:15.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m15s

and if your proudly abnormal Nicole I
00:04:15.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m15s

apologize I actually went and actually
00:04:20.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m20s

had a look at his cricket classifier and
00:04:23.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m23s

I was really pleased to see that his
00:04:26.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m26s

code actually is the exact same code
00:04:27.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m27s

that were used in Lesson one I was
00:04:29.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m29s

hoping that would be the case you know
00:04:32.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m32s

the only thing he changed was the number
00:04:33.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m33s

of epochs I guess so this idea that we
00:04:35.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m35s

can take those four lines of code and
00:04:38.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m38s

reuse it to do other things that's
00:04:40.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m40s

definitely turned out to be true and so
00:04:41.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m41s

these are good things to show like it
00:04:44.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m44s

yeah your organization if you're
00:04:46.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m46s

anything like the executives of this big
00:04:49.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m49s

company I spoke to today there'll be a
00:04:51.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m51s

certain amount of like not to surprise
00:04:52.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m52s

but almost like pushback like if this
00:04:55.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m55s

was true somebody does it all that
00:04:58.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m58s

message she said if this was true
00:04:59.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m59s

somebody would have told us so like why
00:05:00.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m00s

isn't everybody doing this already so
00:05:02.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m02s

we'd like it I think you might have to
00:05:04.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m04s

actually show them you know maybe you
00:05:05.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m05s

can build your own there's some internal
00:05:08.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m08s

data you've got at work or something
00:05:09.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m09s

like here it is you know didn't cost me
00:05:11.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m11s

anything it's all finished fiddly or
00:05:14.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m14s

badly I don't know how to pronounce his
00:05:20.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m20s

00:05:21.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m21s

nice post on just an introductory post
00:05:23.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m23s

on how we train neural networks and I've
00:05:26.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m26s

wanted to point this one out as being
00:05:28.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m28s

like I think this is one of the
00:05:30.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m30s

participants in this course who has got
00:05:33.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m33s

a particular knack for technical
00:05:34.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m34s

communication and I think we can all
00:05:36.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m36s

learn from you know from his post about
00:05:37.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m37s

about good technical writing what I
00:05:40.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m40s

really like particularly is that he he
00:05:43.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m43s

assumes almost nothing like he has a
00:05:46.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m46s

kind of a very chatty tone and describes
00:05:48.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m48s

everything but he also assumes that the
00:05:50.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m50s

reader is intelligent but you know so
00:05:52.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m52s

like he's not afraid to kind of say
00:05:54.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m54s

here's a paper or here's an equation or
00:05:55.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m55s

or whatever but then he's going to go
00:05:57.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m57s

through and tell you exactly what that
00:05:59.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m59s

equation means so it's kind of like this
00:06:00.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m00s

nice mix of like writing for
00:06:03.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m03s

respectfully for an intelligent audience
00:06:06.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m06s

but also not assuming any particular
00:06:08.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m08s

background knowledge so then I made the
00:06:11.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m11s

mistake earlier this week of posting a
00:06:16.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m16s

picture of my first placing on the
00:06:18.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m18s

Carroll seedlings competition at which
00:06:21.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m21s

point five other fast AI students posted
00:06:24.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m24s

their pictures of them pass
00:06:26.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m26s

over the next few days so this is the
00:06:28.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m28s

current leaderboard for the cattle plant
00:06:31.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m31s

seedlings competition I believe the
00:06:33.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m33s

product top six are all fast AI students
00:06:35.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m35s

or in the worst of those teachers and so
00:06:38.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m38s

I think this is like a really Oh James
00:06:42.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m42s

is just passed he was first this is a
00:06:45.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m45s

really good example of like what you can
00:06:48.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m48s

do but this is trying to think it was
00:06:52.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m52s

like a small number of thousands of
00:06:55.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m55s

images and most of the images were only
00:06:58.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m58s

were less than a hundred pixels by a
00:07:02.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m02s

hundred pixels and yet week you know I
00:07:04.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m04s

bet my approach was basically to say
00:07:09.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m09s

let's just run through the notebook we
00:07:11.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m11s

have pretty much default took the I
00:07:13.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m13s

don't know an hour and I'm I think the
00:07:15.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m15s

other students doing a little bit more
00:07:19.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m19s

than that but not a lot more and
00:07:21.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m21s

basically what this is saying is yeah
00:07:23.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m23s

these these techniques work pretty
00:07:25.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m25s

reliably to a point where people that
00:07:28.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m28s

aren't using the fast I know libraries
00:07:30.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m30s

you know literally really struggling
00:07:33.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m33s

let's just pick off these are first aid
00:07:37.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m37s

a students might have to go down quite a
00:07:40.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m40s

way so I thought that was very
00:07:41.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m41s

interesting and really really cool so
00:07:43.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m43s

today we are going to start what I would
00:07:48.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m48s

kind of call like the second half of
00:07:52.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m52s

this course so the first half of this
00:07:55.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m55s

course is being like getting through
00:07:58.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m58s

like these are the applications that we
00:08:01.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m01s

can use this for here's kind of the code
00:08:04.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m04s

you have to write here's a fairly high
00:08:07.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m07s

level ish description of what it's doing
00:08:10.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m10s

and we're kind of we're kind of done for
00:08:13.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m13s

that bit and what we're now going to do
00:08:17.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m17s

is go in reverse we're going to go back
00:08:19.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m19s

over all of those exact same things
00:08:21.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m21s

again but this time we're going to dig
00:08:23.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m23s

into the detail of every one and we're
00:08:25.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m25s

going to look inside the source code of
00:08:27.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m27s

the first idea library to see what it's
00:08:29.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m29s

doing and try to replicate that so in a
00:08:30.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m30s

students like there's not going to be a
00:08:35.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m35s

lot more
00:08:38.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m38s

best practices to show you like I've
00:08:41.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m41s

kind of shown you the best best
00:08:43.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m43s

practices I know but I feel like for us
00:08:45.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m45s

to now build on top of those to debug
00:08:47.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m47s

those models to come back to part two
00:08:50.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m50s

where we're going to kind of try out
00:08:52.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m52s

some new things you know it really helps
00:08:54.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m54s

to understand what's going on behind the
00:08:56.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m56s

scenes okay so the goal here today is
00:08:58.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m58s

we're going to try and create a pretty
00:09:02.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m02s

effective collaborative filtering model
00:09:06.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m06s

almost entirely from scratch so we'll
00:09:09.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m09s

use the kind of we'll use PI torch as a
00:09:13.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m13s

automatic differentiation tool and
00:09:15.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m15s

there's a GPU programming tool and not
00:09:17.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m17s

very much else we'll try not to use its
00:09:19.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m19s

neural net features we'll try not to use
00:09:21.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m21s

fast AI library anymore than necessary
00:09:23.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m23s

so that's the goal so let's go back and
00:09:26.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m26s

you know we only very quickly know
00:09:30.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m30s

collaborative filtering last time so
00:09:31.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m31s

let's let's go back and have a look at
00:09:33.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m33s

collaborative filtering and so we're
00:09:35.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m35s

going to look at this movie lens data
00:09:37.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m37s

set so the movie lens data set basically
00:09:40.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m40s

is a list of ratings it's got a bunch of
00:09:47.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m47s

different users that are represented by
00:09:49.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m49s

some ID and a bunch of movies that are
00:09:51.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m51s

represented by some ID and rating it
00:09:54.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m54s

also has a timestamp
00:09:57.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m57s

I haven't actually ever tried to use
00:09:58.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m58s

this I guess this is just like what what
00:10:00.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m00s

time did that person read that movie so
00:10:02.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m02s

that's all we're going to use for
00:10:07.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m07s

modelling is three columns user ID movie
00:10:09.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m09s

ID and rating and so thinking of that in
00:10:13.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m13s

kind of structured data terms user ID
00:10:16.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m16s

and movie ID would be categorical
00:10:18.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m18s

variables we have two of them and rating
00:10:20.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m20s

would be a with the independent variable
00:10:23.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m23s

we're not going to use this for modeling
00:10:28.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m28s

but we can use it for looking at stuff
00:10:30.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m30s

later we can grab a list of the names of
00:10:32.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m32s

the movies as well and reproduce this
00:10:35.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m35s

genre information I haven't tried to be
00:10:37.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m37s

interested if during the week anybody
00:10:40.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m40s

tries it and finds it helpful my guess
00:10:42.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m42s

is you might not find it helpful
00:10:44.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m44s

we'll see so in order to kind of look at
00:10:46.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m46s

this better I just grabbed
00:10:50.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m50s

the users that have watched the most
00:10:55.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m55s

movies and the movies that have been the
00:10:57.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m57s

most watched and made a crosstab of it
00:10:59.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m59s

right so this is exactly the same data
00:11:03.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m03s

but it's a subset and now rather than
00:11:05.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m05s

being user movie rating we've got user
00:11:08.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m08s

movie rating and so some users haven't
00:11:11.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m11s

watched some of these movies that's why
00:11:16.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m16s

some of these okay then I copied that
00:11:19.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m19s

into Excel and you'll see there's a
00:11:23.650

thing called collab your XLS if you
00:11:27.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m27s

don't see it there now I'll make sure I
00:11:31.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m31s

put it there back tomorrow and here is
00:11:32.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m32s

where I've copied that table okay so as
00:11:37.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m37s

I go through this like setup of the
00:11:43.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m43s

problem and kind of how its described
00:11:46.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m46s

and stuff if you're ever feeling lost
00:11:47.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m47s

feel free to ask either directly or
00:11:50.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m50s

through the forum if you ask through the
00:11:54.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m54s

forum and somebody answers there I want
00:11:56.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m56s

you to answer it here but if somebody
00:11:59.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m59s

else asks a question you would like
00:12:02.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m02s

answered of course just like it and your
00:12:03.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m03s

network keep an eye out for that because
00:12:07.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m07s

kind of that's we're digging in to the
00:12:09.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m09s

details of what's going on behind the
00:12:11.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m11s

scenes it's kind of important that at
00:12:13.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m13s

each stage you feel like okay I can see
00:12:14.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m14s

what's going on okay so we can actually
00:12:16.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m16s

not going to build a neural net to start
00:12:26.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m26s

with instead we're going to do something
00:12:29.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m29s

called a matrix factorization the reason
00:12:32.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m32s

we're not going to build a neural net to
00:12:36.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m36s

start with is that it so happens there's
00:12:38.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m38s

a really really simple kind of way of
00:12:39.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m39s

solving these kinds of problems which
00:12:43.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m43s

I'm going to show you and so if I scroll
00:12:44.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m44s

down I've basically what I've got here
00:12:47.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m47s

is the same the same thing but this time
00:12:50.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m50s

these are my predictions rather than my
00:12:53.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m53s

actuals and I'm going to show you how I
00:12:56.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m56s

created these predictions okay so here
00:12:57.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m57s

my actuals right here my predictions and
00:12:59.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m59s

then down here we have
00:13:03.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m03s

our score which is the sum of the
00:13:07.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m07s

different squared average square root
00:13:11.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m11s

okay so this is I are MSE down here okay
00:13:15.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m15s

so on average we're randomly initialized
00:13:18.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m18s

model is out by 2.8 so let me show you
00:13:22.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m22s

what this model is and I'm going to show
00:13:25.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m25s

you by saying how do we guess how much
00:13:28.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m28s

user ID number 14 likes movie ID number
00:13:30.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m30s

27 and the prediction here this is just
00:13:35.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m35s

at this stage this is still random is
00:13:39.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m39s

0.9 1 so how we calculate 0.9 1 and the
00:13:41.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m41s

answer is we're taking it as this vector
00:13:46.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m46s

here dot product with this vector here
00:13:50.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m50s

so dot product means 0.71 times 0.1 9
00:13:55.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m55s

plus 0.8 1 times point 6 3 plus point 7
00:13:59.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m59s

volt plus point 3 1 and so forth and in
00:14:03.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m03s

you know linear algebra speak because
00:14:05.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m05s

one of them is a column and one of them
00:14:08.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m08s

is a row this is the same as a matrix
00:14:09.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m09s

product so you can see here I've used
00:14:11.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m11s

the Excel fashion matrix multiplier and
00:14:13.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m13s

that's my prediction having said that if
00:14:17.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m17s

the original rating doesn't exist at all
00:14:21.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m21s

then I'm just going to set this to 0
00:14:28.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m28s

right because like there's no error in
00:14:30.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m30s

predicting something that hasn't
00:14:33.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m33s

happened okay so what I'm going to do is
00:14:34.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m34s

I'm basically going to say alright
00:14:37.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m37s

everyone of my right rate my predictions
00:14:38.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m38s

is not going to be a neural net it's
00:14:40.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m40s

going to be a single matrix
00:14:43.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m43s

multiplication all right now the matrix
00:14:45.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m45s

multiplication that it's doing is
00:14:48.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m48s

basically in practice is between like
00:14:51.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m51s

this matrix and this matrix right so
00:14:54.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m54s

each one of these is a single part of
00:15:02.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m02s

that so I randomly initialize these
00:15:04.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m04s

these are just random numbers that I've
00:15:11.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m11s

just pasted in here so I've basically
00:15:14.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m14s

started off with two random matrices and
00:15:16.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m16s

I've said let's
00:15:20.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m20s

assume for the time being that every
00:15:21.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m21s

rating can be represented as the matrix
00:15:24.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m24s

product of those two so then in Excel
00:15:27.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m27s

you can actually do a gradient descent
00:15:31.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m31s

you have to go to your options to the
00:15:36.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m36s

add-ins section and check the box to say
00:15:39.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m39s

turn it on and once you do you'll see
00:15:41.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m41s

there's something there called solver
00:15:43.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m43s

and if I go solver it says okay what's
00:15:44.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m44s

your objective function and you just
00:15:47.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m47s

choose the cell so in this case we chose
00:15:51.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m51s

the cell that contains that repeats
00:15:54.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m54s

grade error and then it says okay what
00:15:56.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m56s

do you want to change and you can see
00:15:59.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m59s

here we've selected this matrix and this
00:16:02.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m02s

matrix and so it's going to do a
00:16:05.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m05s

gradient descent for us by changing
00:16:07.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m07s

these matrices to try and in this case
00:16:09.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m09s

minimize this min minimize this Excel so
00:16:12.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m12s

right GRG nonlinear is a gradient just
00:16:16.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m16s

yet so I'll say solve and you'll see it
00:16:20.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m20s

starts at 2.8 and then down here you'll
00:16:23.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m23s

see that numbers drain down it's not
00:16:26.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m26s

actually showing us what it's doing but
00:16:29.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m29s

we can see that the numbers going down
00:16:30.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m30s

so this has kind of got a near or nettie
00:16:32.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m32s

feel to it in that we're doing like a
00:16:37.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m37s

matrix product and we're doing a
00:16:39.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m39s

gradient descent but we don't have a
00:16:41.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m41s

nonlinear layer and we don't have a
00:16:43.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m43s

second linear layer on top of that so we
00:16:46.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m46s

don't get to call this deep learning so
00:16:49.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m49s

things where people do like deep
00:16:51.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m51s

learning each things where they have
00:16:53.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m53s

kind of matrix products and gradient
00:16:55.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m55s

descents but it's not deep people tend
00:16:58.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m58s

to just call that shallow learning okay
00:17:00.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m00s

so we're doing this chattering yeah all
00:17:01.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m01s

right so I'm just going to go ahead and
00:17:05.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m05s

press escape to stop it because I'm sick
00:17:06.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m06s

of waiting and so you can see we've now
00:17:07.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m07s

got down to the 0.39 all right so for
00:17:12.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m12s

example it guessed that movie 72 for
00:17:17.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m17s

sorry movie 27 for user seventy two
00:17:22.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m22s

would get 4.4 for rating 2772 and
00:17:24.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m24s

actually got a four ready so you can see
00:17:30.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m30s

like it's it's it's doing something
00:17:32.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m32s

quite useful
00:17:34.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m34s

so why is it doing something quite
00:17:36.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m36s

useful I mean something to note here is
00:17:40.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m40s

the number of things we're trying to
00:17:42.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m42s

predict here is there's 225 of them
00:17:45.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m45s

right and the number of things we're
00:17:48.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m48s

using to predict is that times two so
00:17:51.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m51s

hundred and fifty of them so it's not
00:17:54.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m54s

like we can just exactly fit we actually
00:17:56.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m56s

have to do some kind of machine learning
00:17:57.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m57s

here so basically what this is saying is
00:18:00.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m00s

that there does seem to be some way of
00:18:03.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m03s

making predictions in this way and so
00:18:06.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m06s

for those of you that have done some
00:18:11.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m11s

linear algebra and this is actually a
00:18:12.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m12s

matrix decomposition normally in linear
00:18:14.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m14s

algebra you would do this using a
00:18:17.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m17s

analytical technique or using some
00:18:19.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m19s

techniques that are specifically
00:18:22.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m22s

designed for this purpose but the nice
00:18:23.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m23s

thing is that we can use gradient
00:18:25.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m25s

descent to solve pretty much everything
00:18:27.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m27s

including this I don't like to so much
00:18:29.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m29s

think of it from a linear algebra point
00:18:32.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m32s

of view though I like to think of it
00:18:33.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m33s

from an insured point of view which is
00:18:35.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m35s

this let's say movie sorry let's say
00:18:36.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m36s

movie id 27 is Lord of the Rings part 1
00:18:39.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m39s

and let's say move and so let's say
00:18:45.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m45s

we're trying to make that prediction for
00:18:51.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m51s

user 2072 are they going to like Lord of
00:18:53.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m53s

the Rings part 1 and so conceptually
00:18:56.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m56s

that particular movie maybe there's like
00:18:59.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m59s

this 4
00:19:02.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m02s

so there's 5 numbers here and we could
00:19:03.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m03s

say like well what if the first one was
00:19:07.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m07s

like how much is it sci-fi and fantasy
00:19:09.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m09s

and the second one is like how recent a
00:19:11.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m11s

movie and how much special effects is
00:19:15.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m15s

there you know and the one at the top
00:19:17.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m17s

might be like how dialogue-driven is it
00:19:19.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m19s

right like let's say those kind of five
00:19:21.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m21s

these five numbers represented
00:19:23.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m23s

particular things about the movie and so
00:19:25.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m25s

if that was the case then we could have
00:19:27.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m27s

the same five numbers for the user
00:19:30.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m30s

saying like ok how much does the use of
00:19:32.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m32s

like sci-fi fantasy how much does the
00:19:34.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m34s

user like modern modern CGI driven
00:19:37.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m37s

movies how much does this give us a like
00:19:42.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m42s

dialogue different movies and so if you
00:19:45.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m45s

then took that
00:19:48.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m48s

cross-product you would expect to have a
00:19:48.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m48s

good model right would expect to have a
00:19:51.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m51s

reasonable reading now the problem is we
00:19:53.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m53s

don't have this information for each
00:19:57.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m57s

user we don't have the information for
00:19:58.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m58s

each movie so we're just going to like
00:20:00.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m00s

assume that this is a reasonable kind of
00:20:02.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m02s

way of thinking about this system and
00:20:06.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m06s

let's unless stochastic gradient descent
00:20:08.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m08s

try and find these models right so so in
00:20:10.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m10s

other words these these factors we call
00:20:13.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m13s

these things factors these factors and
00:20:16.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m16s

we call them factors because you can
00:20:19.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m19s

multiply them together to create this
00:20:20.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m20s

not they're factors and how many
00:20:22.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m22s

addresses these factors we call them
00:20:24.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m24s

latent factors because they're not
00:20:26.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m26s

actually this is not actually a vector
00:20:29.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m29s

that we've like named and understood and
00:20:33.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m33s

like entered in manually we've kind of
00:20:36.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m36s

assumed that we can think of movie
00:20:38.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m38s

ratings this way we've assumed that we
00:20:41.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m41s

can think of them as a dot product of
00:20:43.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m43s

some particular features about a movie
00:20:46.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m46s

and some particular features of to look
00:20:49.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m49s

what users like those kinds of movies
00:20:51.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m51s

right and then we've used gradient
00:20:53.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m53s

descent to just say okay try and find
00:20:55.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m55s

some numbers that work so that's that's
00:20:58.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m58s

basically the technique right and it's
00:21:03.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m03s

kind of the end and the entirety is in
00:21:05.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m05s

this printing right so that is
00:21:09.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m09s

collaborative filtering using what we
00:21:10.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m10s

call probabilistic matrix factorization
00:21:12.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m12s

and as you can see the whole thing is
00:21:14.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m14s

easy to do in an excel spreadsheet and
00:21:17.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m17s

the entirety of it really is this single
00:21:19.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m19s

thing which is a single matrix
00:21:21.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m21s

multiplication plus randomly
00:21:23.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m23s

initializing if it would be better to
00:21:26.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m26s

cap this to 0 and 5 maybe yes yeah and
00:21:32.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m32s

we're gonna do that later right there's
00:21:38.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m38s

a whole lot of stuff we can do to
00:21:39.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m39s

improve this this is like our simple as
00:21:41.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m41s

possible starting point all right so so
00:21:44.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m44s

what we're going to do now is we're
00:21:46.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m46s

going to try and implement this in
00:21:47.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m47s

Python and run it on the whole data set
00:21:50.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m50s

another question is how do you figure
00:21:54.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m54s

out how many you know how it's clear how
00:21:56.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m56s

long are the matrix
00:22:00.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m00s

five yeah yeah so something to think
00:22:02.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m02s

about given that this is like movie 49
00:22:05.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m05s

right and we're looking at a rating for
00:22:09.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m09s

movie 49 think about this this is
00:22:13.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m13s

actually at embedding matrix and so this
00:22:16.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m16s

length is actually the size of the
00:22:21.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m21s

embedding matrix I'm not saying this is
00:22:24.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m24s

an analogy I'm saying it literally this
00:22:26.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m26s

is literally an embedding mattress we
00:22:29.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m29s

could have a one hot encoding where 72
00:22:31.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m31s

where a one is in the 72nd position and
00:22:34.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m34s

so we'd like to look it up and it would
00:22:37.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m37s

return this list of five numbers so the
00:22:39.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m39s

question is actually how do we decide on
00:22:43.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m43s

the dimensionality of our embedding
00:22:45.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m45s

vectors and the answer to that question
00:22:47.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m47s

is we have no idea we have to try a few
00:22:50.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m50s

things and see what was the underlying
00:22:53.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m53s

concept is you need to pick an embedding
00:22:57.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m57s

dimensionality which is enough to
00:23:01.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m01s

reflect the kind of true complexity of
00:23:04.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m04s

this causal system but not so big that
00:23:06.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m06s

you have too many parameters that it
00:23:11.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m11s

could take forever to Tehran or even
00:23:14.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m14s

with regularization in my overfit so
00:23:16.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m16s

what does it mean when the factor is
00:23:20.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m20s

negative that the factor being negative
00:23:23.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m23s

in the movie case would mean like this
00:23:27.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m27s

is not dialogue-driven in fact it's like
00:23:30.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m30s

the opposite dialogue here is terrible a
00:23:32.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m32s

negative for the user would be like I
00:23:34.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m34s

actually dislike modern CGI movies so
00:23:37.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m37s

it's not from zero to whatever it's the
00:23:41.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m41s

range of score it'd be negative this is
00:23:44.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m44s

a range of score even like no net Maxim
00:23:47.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m47s

no there's no constraints at all here
00:23:49.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m49s

these are just standard embedding
00:23:51.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m51s

matrices questions so first question is
00:23:54.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m54s

why do what why can we trust this
00:24:02.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m02s

embeddings because like if you take a
00:24:05.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m05s

number six it can be expressed as 1 into
00:24:07.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m07s

6 or like 6 into 1 or 22 3 &amp; 3 into 2
00:24:09.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m09s

all so you're saying like we could like
00:24:11.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m11s

reorder these higher
00:24:14.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m14s

hardly the value itself might be
00:24:17.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m17s

different as long as the product is
00:24:19.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m19s

something well but you see we're using
00:24:21.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m21s

gradient descent to find the best
00:24:23.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m23s

numbers so like once we've found a good
00:24:26.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m26s

minimum the idea is like yeah there are
00:24:29.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m29s

other numbers but they don't give you as
00:24:33.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m33s

good an objective value and of course we
00:24:35.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m35s

should be checking that on a validation
00:24:39.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m39s

set really which we'll be doing in the
00:24:40.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m40s

Python version okay and the second
00:24:42.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m42s

question is when we have a new movie or
00:24:44.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m44s

a new user to be a 30 trainer model that
00:24:47.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m47s

is a really good question and there
00:24:50.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m50s

isn't a straightforward answer to that
00:24:51.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m51s

time permitting will come back but
00:24:53.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m53s

basically you would need to have like a
00:24:56.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m56s

kind of a new user model or a new movie
00:24:58.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m58s

model that you would use initially and
00:25:01.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m01s

then over time yes you would then have
00:25:05.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m05s

to retrain the model so like I don't
00:25:08.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m08s

know if they still do it but Netflix
00:25:11.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m11s

used to have this thing that when you
00:25:12.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m12s

were first on boarded on Netflix it
00:25:13.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m13s

would say like what movies do you like
00:25:15.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m15s

and you'd have to go through and let's
00:25:17.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m17s

say a bunch of movies you like and it
00:25:19.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m19s

would then my train is moral just find
00:25:21.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m21s

the nearest movie yeah you could use
00:25:29.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m29s

nearest neighbors for sure but the thing
00:25:34.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m34s

is initially at least in this case we
00:25:39.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m39s

have no columns to describe a movie so
00:25:43.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m43s

if you had something about like the
00:25:47.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m47s

movies genre release date who was in it
00:25:48.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m48s

or something you could have some kind of
00:25:51.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m51s

non collaborative filtering model and
00:25:53.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m53s

that's kind of what I meant a new movie
00:25:55.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m55s

model you have to have some some kind of
00:25:58.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m58s

predictors okay so a lot of this is
00:26:00.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m00s

going to look familiar and and the way
00:26:08.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m08s

I'm going to do this is again it's kind
00:26:10.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m10s

of this top-down approach we're going to
00:26:12.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m12s

start using a few features of Pi torch
00:26:14.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m14s

and fast AI and gradually we're going to
00:26:17.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m17s

redo it
00:26:20.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m20s

a few times in a few different ways kind
00:26:20.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m20s

of doing a little bit deeper each time
00:26:24.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m24s

um regardless we do need a validation
00:26:26.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m26s

set
00:26:29.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m29s

so we can use our standard
00:26:30.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m30s

cross-validation indexes approach to
00:26:31.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m31s

grab a random set of ID's this is
00:26:34.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m34s

something called weight decay which
00:26:39.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m39s

we'll talk about later in the course for
00:26:41.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m41s

those of you that have done some machine
00:26:43.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m43s

learning it's l2 regularization
00:26:45.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m45s

basically and this is where we choose
00:26:47.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m47s

how big a embedding matrix do we want
00:26:50.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m50s

okay
00:26:52.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m52s

so again you know here's where we get
00:26:54.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m54s

our model data object from CSV passing
00:26:57.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m57s

in that ratings file which remember
00:27:02.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m02s

looks like that okay so you'll see like
00:27:06.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m06s

stuff tends to look pretty familiar
00:27:10.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m10s

after a while and then you just have to
00:27:12.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m12s

pass in the what are your rows
00:27:17.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m17s

effectively what are your columns
00:27:22.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m22s

effectively and what are your values
00:27:24.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m24s

effectively alright so any any
00:27:25.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m25s

collaborative filtering recommendation
00:27:28.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m28s

system approach there's basically a
00:27:31.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m31s

concept of like you know a user and an
00:27:32.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m32s

item now they might not be users and
00:27:35.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m35s

items like if you're doing the
00:27:39.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m39s

Ecuadorian groceries competition there
00:27:40.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m40s

are stores and items and you're trying
00:27:43.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m43s

to predict how many things are you going
00:27:45.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m45s

to sell at this store of this type but
00:27:47.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m47s

generally speaking just this idea of
00:27:53.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m53s

like you've got a couple of kind of high
00:27:55.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m55s

cardinality categorical variables and
00:27:57.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m57s

something that you're measuring and
00:27:59.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m59s

you're kind of conceptualizing and
00:28:00.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m00s

saying okay we could predict the rating
00:28:02.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m02s

we can predict the value by doing this
00:28:05.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m05s

this dot for that interestingly this is
00:28:08.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m08s

kind of relevant to that that last
00:28:12.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m12s

question or suggestion an identical way
00:28:13.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m13s

to think about this what I've expressed
00:28:17.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m17s

this is to say when we're deciding
00:28:19.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m19s

whether user 72 will like movie
00:28:23.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m23s

twenty-seven it's basically saying which
00:28:26.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m26s

other users liked movies that 72 liked
00:28:30.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m30s

and which other movies were liked by
00:28:36.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m36s

people like you
00:28:40.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m40s

user 72 it turns out that these are
00:28:43.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m43s

basically two ways of saying the exact
00:28:46.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m46s

same thing so basically what
00:28:49.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m49s

collaborative filtering is doing you
00:28:50.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m50s

know kind of conceptually is to say okay
00:28:53.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m53s

this movie and this user which other
00:28:56.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m56s

movies are similar to it in terms of
00:28:59.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m59s

like similar people enjoyed them and
00:29:01.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m01s

which people are similar to this person
00:29:04.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m04s

based on people that like the same kind
00:29:07.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m07s

of movies so that's kind of the
00:29:08.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m08s

underlying structure at any time there's
00:29:11.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m11s

an underlying structure like this that
00:29:14.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m14s

kind of collaborative filtering approach
00:29:16.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m16s

is likely to be useful okay so so you
00:29:17.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m17s

yeah so there's basically two parts the
00:29:22.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m22s

two bits of your thing that you're
00:29:25.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m25s

factoring and then the the value of the
00:29:26.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m26s

dependent variable so as per usual we
00:29:28.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m28s

can take our model data and ask for a
00:29:31.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m31s

learner from it and we need to tell it
00:29:34.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m34s

what size of any matrix to use how many
00:29:36.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m36s

sorry what validation set index is to
00:29:39.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m39s

use what batch size to use and what
00:29:42.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m42s

optimizer to use and we're going to be
00:29:45.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m45s

talking more about optimizes surely we
00:29:47.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m47s

want to Adam today Adam next week or the
00:29:51.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m51s

week after and then we can go ahead and
00:29:54.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m54s

say fit alright and it all looks pretty
00:29:57.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m57s

similar interest is usually
00:30:00.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m00s

interestingly I only had to do three
00:30:03.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m03s

pops like this kind of model seem to
00:30:05.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m05s

Train
00:30:08.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m08s

super quickly you can use the learning
00:30:08.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m08s

rate finder as per usual all the stuff
00:30:11.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m11s

you're familiar with will work fine and
00:30:13.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m13s

that was it so this talk you know about
00:30:15.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m15s

two seconds the Train there's no free
00:30:17.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m17s

trained anything's here this is from
00:30:21.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m21s

random from scratch okay so this is our
00:30:22.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m22s

validation set and we can compare it we
00:30:27.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m27s

have this is a mean squared error not a
00:30:29.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m29s

root mean squared error so we can take a
00:30:31.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m31s

square root so with that last time I ran
00:30:33.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m33s

it was point seven seven six and that's
00:30:37.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m37s

0.88 and there's some benchmarks
00:30:39.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m39s

available for this data set and when I
00:30:42.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m42s

scrolled through and found the bench the
00:30:45.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m45s

best benchmark I could find here from
00:30:46.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m46s

this recommendation system specific
00:30:48.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m48s

library they had point nine one so we've
00:30:51.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m51s

got a better loss in two seconds
00:30:54.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m54s

already so that's good so that's
00:30:58.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m58s

basically how you can do collaborative
00:31:03.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m03s

filtering with the faster I library
00:31:05.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m05s

without thinking too much but so now
00:31:09.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m09s

we're going to dig in and try and
00:31:12.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m12s

rebuild that we'll try and get to the
00:31:14.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m14s

point that we're getting something
00:31:16.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m16s

around 0.7 seven point seven eight from
00:31:17.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m17s

scratch but if you want to do this
00:31:21.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m21s

yourself at home
00:31:25.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m25s

you know without worry about the detail
00:31:26.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m26s

that's you know those three lines of
00:31:27.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m27s

code here's what you need okay so we can
00:31:30.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m30s

get the predictions in the usual way and
00:31:33.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m33s

you know we could for example plot SNS
00:31:35.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m35s

is Seabourn see one's a really great
00:31:39.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m39s

flooding library it sits on top of
00:31:40.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m40s

matplotlib it actually leverages
00:31:42.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m42s

matplotlib so anything you learn about
00:31:45.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m45s

matplotlib will help you with SIBO and
00:31:47.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m47s

it's got a few like nice little plots
00:31:48.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m48s

like this joint plot here is I'm doing
00:31:50.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m50s

predictions against against actuals so
00:31:54.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m54s

these are my actual season my
00:31:58.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m58s

predictions and you can kind of see the
00:32:00.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m00s

the shape here is that as we predict
00:32:02.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m02s

higher numbers they actually are higher
00:32:04.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m04s

numbers and you can also see the
00:32:06.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m06s

histogram of the predictions and a
00:32:07.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m07s

histogram of the ashes so that's kind of
00:32:10.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m10s

floating that is to show you another
00:32:12.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m12s

interesting visualization would you
00:32:14.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m14s

please explain the n factors why it's
00:32:18.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m18s

set to 50 it's set to 50 because I tried
00:32:22.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m22s

a few things in the world it's the
00:32:25.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m25s

dimensionality of the embedding images
00:32:29.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m29s

or to think for it another way it's like
00:32:31.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m31s

how you know rather than five it's fit
00:32:34.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m34s

Jeremy I have a question about suppose
00:32:41.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m41s

that your recommendation system is more
00:32:45.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m45s

implicit so you have zeros or ones
00:32:50.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m50s

instead of just actual numbers right so
00:32:52.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m52s

basically we would then need to use a
00:32:56.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m56s

classifier instead of regresa
00:32:59.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m59s

I have to sample the negative or
00:33:01.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m01s

something like that so if you don't have
00:33:05.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m05s

it which is up once let's say like just
00:33:06.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m06s

kind of implicit feedback
00:33:09.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m09s

oh I'm not sure we'll get to that one in
00:33:11.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m11s

this class but what I will say is like
00:33:13.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m13s

in the case that you just doing
00:33:15.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m15s

classification rather than regression we
00:33:16.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m16s

haven't actually built that in the
00:33:20.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m20s

library yet maybe somebody this week
00:33:21.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m21s

that wants to try adding it it would
00:33:23.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m23s

only be a small number of lines of code
00:33:24.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m24s

you basically have to change the
00:33:26.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m26s

activation function to be a sigmoid and
00:33:28.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m28s

you would have to change the criterion
00:33:30.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m30s

or the loss function to be cross-entropy
00:33:34.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m34s

rather than rmse and that will give you
00:33:37.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m37s

a classifier rather than a regresar how
00:33:41.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m41s

those are the only things you'll have to
00:33:44.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m44s

change so hopefully somebody this week
00:33:45.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m45s

won't take up that challenge and by the
00:33:47.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m47s

time we come back next week we've all
00:33:49.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m49s

have that working ok so I said that
00:33:50.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m50s

we're basically doing a dot product
00:33:57.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m57s

right or you know a dot product is kind
00:33:59.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m59s

of the vector version I guess of this
00:34:02.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m02s

matrix product so we're basically doing
00:34:04.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m04s

each of these things times each of these
00:34:07.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m07s

things and then add it together so let's
00:34:10.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m10s

just have a look at how we do that in
00:34:14.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m14s

Python so we can create a tensor in pi
00:34:16.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m16s

torch just using this little capital T
00:34:20.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m20s

thing you can just say that's the first
00:34:22.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m22s

day I version the full version is torch
00:34:25.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m25s

dot from I'm pie or something but I've
00:34:26.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m26s

got to set up so you can possibly pass
00:34:29.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m29s

in even a list of lists so this is going
00:34:31.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m31s

to create a torch tensor with one two
00:34:34.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m34s

three four and then here's a torch
00:34:37.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m37s

tensor with two to ten ten ok so here
00:34:39.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m39s

are two more chances
00:34:43.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m43s

I didn't say doc CUDA so they're not on
00:34:45.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m45s

the GPU they're sitting on the CPU just
00:34:48.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m48s

FYI we can multiply them together right
00:34:51.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m51s

and so anytime you have a mathematical
00:34:55.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m55s

operator between tensors in numpy or
00:34:57.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m57s

pipe torch it will do element wise
00:35:01.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m01s

assuming that they're the same
00:35:04.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m04s

dimensionality which they are they're
00:35:06.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m06s

both to about two okay and so here we've
00:35:07.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m07s

got 2 by 2 is 4 3 by 10 is 30 and so
00:35:11.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m11s

forth ok so there's a a times B so if
00:35:15.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m15s

you think about basically what we want
00:35:19.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m19s

to do here is we want to take
00:35:21.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m21s

ok so I've got 1 times 2 is 2 2 times 2
00:35:29.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m29s

is 4 2 plus 4 is 6 and so that is
00:35:35.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m35s

actually the dot product between 1 2 &amp; 2
00:35:40.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m40s

4 and then here we've got 3 by 10 is 34
00:35:43.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m43s

by 40 sorry 4 by 10 is 40 30 and 40 and
00:35:48.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m48s

70 so in other words a times B dot some
00:35:51.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m51s

along the first dimension
00:35:56.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m56s

so that's summing up the columns in
00:35:58.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m58s

other words across a row okay this thing
00:36:00.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m00s

here is doing the dot product of each of
00:36:03.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m03s

these rows with each of these rows so it
00:36:07.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m07s

makes sense and obviously we could do
00:36:11.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m11s

that with you know some kind of matrix
00:36:13.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m13s

multiplication approach but I'm trying
00:36:16.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m16s

to really do things with this little
00:36:17.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m17s

special case stuff as possible ok so
00:36:20.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m20s

that's what we're going to use for our
00:36:24.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m24s

dot products from now on so basically
00:36:25.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m25s

all we need to do now is remember we
00:36:28.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m28s

have the data we have is not in that
00:36:31.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m31s

crosstab format so in excel we've got it
00:36:34.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m34s

in this crosstab format but we've got it
00:36:36.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m36s

here in this listed format here's our
00:36:39.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m39s

movie rating user movie revenue so
00:36:42.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m42s

conceptually we want to be like looking
00:36:44.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m44s

up this user into our embedding matrix
00:36:46.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m46s

to find their 50 factors looking up that
00:36:49.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m49s

movie to find their 50 factors and then
00:36:51.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m51s

take the dot product of those two 50
00:36:53.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m53s

long vectors so let's do that to do it
00:36:56.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m56s

we're going to build a layer our own
00:37:05.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m05s

custom neural net layer that's not right
00:37:08.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m08s

so the the the more generic vocabulary
00:37:12.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m12s

we call this is we're going to build a
00:37:15.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m15s

high torch module okay so a PI torch
00:37:17.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m17s

module is a very specific thing it's
00:37:21.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m21s

something that you can use as a layer
00:37:24.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m24s

and a neural net once you've created
00:37:26.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m26s

your own height watch module you can
00:37:27.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m27s

throw it into a mirror on it and a
00:37:29.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m29s

module works by assuming we've already
00:37:32.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m32s

got once a cordon
00:37:35.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m35s

model you can pass in some things in
00:37:36.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m36s

parentheses and it will calculate it
00:37:39.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m39s

right so assuming that we already have a
00:37:40.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m40s

modular product we can instantiate it
00:37:43.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m43s

like so to create our product object and
00:37:48.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m48s

we can basically now treat that like a
00:37:52.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m52s

function right but the thing is it's not
00:37:54.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m54s

just a function because we'll be able to
00:37:57.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m57s

do things like take derivatives of it
00:38:00.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m00s

stack them up together into a big stack
00:38:02.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m02s

of neural network layers blah blah blah
00:38:06.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m06s

so it's basically a function that we can
00:38:08.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m08s

kind of compose very conveniently so
00:38:11.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m11s

here how do we define a module which as
00:38:14.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m14s

you can see here returns a dot product
00:38:18.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m18s

well we have to create a Python class
00:38:20.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m20s

and so if you haven't done - oo before
00:38:23.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m23s

you're going to have to learn because
00:38:26.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m26s

all my torch modules are written in
00:38:28.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m28s

Python oo and that's one of the things I
00:38:31.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m31s

really like about PI torch is that it
00:38:33.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m33s

doesn't reinvent totally new ways of
00:38:35.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m35s

doing things by tensorflow does all the
00:38:38.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m38s

time in pi torch that you know really
00:38:40.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m40s

tend to use pythonic ways to do things
00:38:43.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m43s

so in this case how do you create you
00:38:46.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m46s

know some kind of new behavior you
00:38:48.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m48s

create a Python plus it's so Jeremy
00:38:51.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m51s

suppose that you have a lot of data not
00:38:55.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m55s

just a little bit of data you can have
00:38:59.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m59s

in memory will you be able to use fossae
00:39:01.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m01s

I to solve glory filtering yes
00:39:03.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m03s

absolutely
00:39:07.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m07s

it's it uses mini-batch stochastic
00:39:08.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m08s

gradient descent which does have a batch
00:39:15.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m15s

at a time the this particular version is
00:39:16.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m16s

going to create a panda's data frame and
00:39:26.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m26s

panda's data frame has to live in memory
00:39:30.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m30s

having said that you can get easily 512
00:39:33.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m33s

gig you know instances on Amazon so like
00:39:37.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m37s

if you had a CSV that was bigger than
00:39:40.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m40s

512 gig you know that would be
00:39:42.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m42s

impressive if that did happen I guess
00:39:46.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m46s

you would have to instead
00:39:48.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m48s

save that as a be calls array and create
00:39:50.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m50s

a slightly different version that reads
00:39:52.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m52s

from a because array just streaming in
00:39:54.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m54s

or maybe from a desk data frame which
00:39:56.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m56s

also so it would be easy to do I don't
00:40:00.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m00s

think I've seen real-world situations
00:40:03.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m03s

where you have 512 gigabyte
00:40:06.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m06s

collaborative filtering matrices but
00:40:09.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m09s

yeah we can do it okay now this is PI
00:40:11.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m11s

torch specific this next bit is that
00:40:18.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m18s

when you define like the actual work to
00:40:20.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m20s

be done which is here return user times
00:40:23.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m23s

movie dot some you have to put it in a
00:40:26.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m26s

special method called forward okay and
00:40:29.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m29s

this is this idea that like it's very
00:40:32.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m32s

likely you're on that right in a neural
00:40:34.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m34s

net the thing where you calculate the
00:40:37.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m37s

next set of activations is called the
00:40:39.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m39s

the forward pass and so that's doing a
00:40:43.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m43s

forward calculation the gradients is
00:40:45.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m45s

called the backward calculation we don't
00:40:48.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m48s

have to do that because PI torch
00:40:50.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m50s

calculates that automatically so we just
00:40:51.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m51s

have to define forward so we create a
00:40:53.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m53s

new class we define forward and here we
00:40:56.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m56s

write in our definition of dot product
00:40:59.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m59s

ok so that's it so now that we've
00:41:01.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m01s

created this class definition we can
00:41:05.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m05s

instantiate our model right and we can
00:41:08.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m08s

call our model and get back the numbers
00:41:11.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m11s

be expected okay so that's it that's how
00:41:13.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m13s

we create a custom PI torch layer and if
00:41:16.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m16s

you compare that to like any other
00:41:20.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m20s

library around pretty much this is way
00:41:23.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m23s

easier basically I guess because we're
00:41:25.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m25s

leveraging what's already in person so
00:41:28.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m28s

let's go ahead and now create a more
00:41:32.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m32s

complex module and we're going to
00:41:34.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m34s

basically do the same thing we've got to
00:41:38.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m38s

have a forward again we're going to have
00:41:40.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m40s

our users x movies dot sum but we're
00:41:43.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m43s

going to do one more thing before hand
00:41:46.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m46s

which is we're going to create two
00:41:47.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m47s

embedding matrices and then we're going
00:41:49.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m49s

to look up our users and our movies in
00:41:52.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m52s

those inventing matrices so let's go
00:41:54.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m54s

through and and do that so the first
00:41:57.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m57s

thing to realize is
00:42:01.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m01s

that the uses the user IDs and the movie
00:42:03.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m03s

IDs may not be contiguous you know like
00:42:07.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m07s

they're maybe they start at a million
00:42:11.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m11s

and go to a million in 1000 so right so
00:42:12.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m12s

if we just used those IDs directly to
00:42:16.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m16s

look up into an embedding matrix we
00:42:21.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m21s

would have to create an embedding matrix
00:42:23.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m23s

of size 1 million 1000 right which we
00:42:24.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m24s

don't want to do so the first thing I do
00:42:27.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m27s

is to get a list of the unique user IDs
00:42:29.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m29s

and then I create a mapping from every
00:42:33.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m33s

user ID to a contiguous integer this
00:42:37.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m37s

thing I've done here where I've created
00:42:42.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m42s

a dictionary which maps from every
00:42:44.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m44s

unique thing to a unique index is well
00:42:48.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m48s

worth studying
00:42:51.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m51s

during the week because like it's is
00:42:52.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m52s

super super handy it's something you
00:42:54.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m54s

very very often have to do in all kinds
00:42:56.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m56s

of machine learning all right and so I
00:42:58.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m58s

won't go through it here it's easy
00:43:00.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m00s

enough to figure out if you can't figure
00:43:02.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m02s

it out just ask on the forum anyway so
00:43:03.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m03s

once we've got the mapping from user to
00:43:06.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m06s

a contiguous index we then can say let's
00:43:10.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m10s

now replace the user ID column with that
00:43:14.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m14s

contiguous index right so pandas dot
00:43:18.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m18s

apply applies an arbitrary function and
00:43:22.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m22s

python lambda is how you create an
00:43:25.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m25s

anonymous function on the fly and this
00:43:27.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m27s

anonymous function simply returns the NS
00:43:29.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m29s

through the same thing for movies and so
00:43:32.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m32s

after that we now have the same ratings
00:43:36.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m36s

table we had before but our IDs have
00:43:38.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m38s

been mapped to contiguous integers
00:43:41.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m41s

therefore they're things that we can
00:43:43.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m43s

look up into an embedding matrix so
00:43:45.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m45s

let's get the count of our users in our
00:43:49.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m49s

movies and let's now go ahead and try
00:43:51.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m51s

and create our Python version of this
00:43:54.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m54s

okay
00:43:59.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m59s

so earlier on when we created our
00:44:00.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m00s

simplest possible PI torch module
00:44:05.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m05s

there was no like state we didn't need a
00:44:10.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m10s

constructor because we weren't like
00:44:14.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m14s

saying how many users are there or how
00:44:16.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m16s

many movies are there or how many
00:44:18.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m18s

factors do we want or whatever right
00:44:19.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m19s

anytime we want to do something like
00:44:21.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m21s

this where we're passing in and saying
00:44:25.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m25s

we want to construct our module with
00:44:28.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m28s

this number of users and this number of
00:44:32.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m32s

movies then we need a constructor for
00:44:34.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m34s

our class and you create a constructor
00:44:37.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m37s

in Python by defining a dunder init
00:44:40.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m40s

underscore underscore init underscore
00:44:44.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m44s

underscore yet special name
00:44:45.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m45s

so this just creates a constructor and
00:44:47.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m47s

if you haven't done over before you
00:44:50.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m50s

wanted to do some study during the week
00:44:53.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m53s

but it's pretty simple idea this is just
00:44:54.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m54s

the thing that when we create this
00:44:57.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m57s

object this is what gets wrong okay
00:44:59.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m59s

again special python thing when you
00:45:01.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m01s

create your own constructor you have to
00:45:04.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m04s

call the parent class constructor and if
00:45:07.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m07s

you want to have all of the cool
00:45:09.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m09s

behavior of a PI porch module you get
00:45:11.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m11s

that by inheriting from an end module
00:45:13.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m13s

neural net module okay so basically by
00:45:17.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m17s

inheriting here and calling the
00:45:20.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m20s

superclass constructor we now have a
00:45:22.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m22s

fully functioning PI torch layer okay so
00:45:25.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m25s

now we have to give it some behavior and
00:45:28.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m28s

so we give us some behavior by storing
00:45:30.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m30s

some things in it all right so here
00:45:32.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m32s

we're going to create something called
00:45:35.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m35s

self dot you users and that is going to
00:45:38.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m38s

be an embedding layer a number of rows
00:45:41.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m41s

is an user's number of columns is in
00:45:45.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m45s

factors so that is exactly this right
00:45:47.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m47s

the number of rows is M users number of
00:45:51.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m51s

columns is inventors and then we'll have
00:45:55.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m55s

to do the same thing for movies okay so
00:45:58.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m58s

that's going to go ahead and create
00:46:01.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m01s

these two randomly initialized arrays
00:46:04.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m04s

however when you randomly initialize
00:46:09.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m09s

over an array it's important to randomly
00:46:12.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m12s

initialize it to a reasonable set of
00:46:14.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m14s

numbers like a reasonable scale right if
00:46:17.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m17s

we randomly initialize them from like
00:46:20.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m20s

naught to a million then we would start
00:46:22.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m22s

out and you know these things would
00:46:24.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m24s

start out being like you know billions
00:46:26.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m26s

and billions of
00:46:29.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m29s

writing and that's going to be very hard
00:46:30.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m30s

to do gradient descent on so I just kind
00:46:32.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m32s

of manually figured here like okay about
00:46:35.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m35s

what size numbers are going to give me
00:46:38.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m38s

about the right readiness and so we
00:46:41.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m41s

don't we know we did ratings between
00:46:43.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m43s

about normal five so if we start out
00:46:44.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m44s

with stuff between about naught and 0.05
00:46:48.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m48s

then we're going to get ratings of about
00:46:51.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m51s

the right level you can easily enough
00:46:52.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m52s

like that calculate that in in neural
00:46:56.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m56s

nets there are standard algorithms for
00:46:58.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m58s

basically doing doing that calculation
00:47:02.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m02s

and the basic the key algorithm is
00:47:05.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m05s

something called initialization from
00:47:08.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m08s

climbing her and the basic idea is that
00:47:12.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m12s

you take the yeah you basically set the
00:47:19.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m19s

weights equal to a normal distribution
00:47:25.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m25s

with a standard deviation which is
00:47:32.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m32s

basically inversely proportional to the
00:47:35.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m35s

number of things in the previous layer
00:47:37.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m37s

and so in our previous layer so in this
00:47:40.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m40s

case we basically if you basically take
00:47:48.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m48s

that nor to 0.05 and multiply it by the
00:47:51.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m51s

fact that you've got 40 things with a 40
00:47:54.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m54s

or 50 things coming out of it
00:47:58.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m58s

50 50 things coming out of it and then
00:48:00.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m00s

you're going to get something about the
00:48:03.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m03s

right size pi torch has already has like
00:48:04.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m04s

her initialization class they're like we
00:48:09.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m09s

don't in normally in real life have to
00:48:13.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m13s

think about this we can just call the
00:48:15.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m15s

existing initialization functions but
00:48:16.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m16s

we're trying to do this all like from
00:48:19.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m19s

scratch here okay without any special
00:48:21.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m21s

stuff going on so there's quite a bit of
00:48:24.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m24s

pi torch notation here so self dot u
00:48:28.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m28s

we've already set to an instance of the
00:48:31.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m31s

embedding class it has a dot weight
00:48:34.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m34s

attribute which contains the actual the
00:48:39.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m39s

actual embed images
00:48:42.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m42s

so that contains this the actual
00:48:44.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m44s

embedding matrix is not a tensor it's a
00:48:49.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m49s

variable a variable is exactly the same
00:48:53.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m53s

as a tensor in other words it supports
00:48:57.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m57s

the exact same operations as a tensor
00:48:59.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m59s

but it also does automatic
00:49:02.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m02s

differentiation that's all a variable is
00:49:05.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m05s

basically to pull the tensor out of a
00:49:08.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m08s

variable you get its data attribute okay
00:49:13.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m13s

so this is so this is now the tensor of
00:49:16.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m16s

the weight matrix of the self dot you're
00:49:19.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m19s

inventing and then something that's
00:49:22.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m22s

really handy to know is that all of the
00:49:25.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m25s

tensor functions in pi torch you can
00:49:27.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m27s

stick an underscore at the end and that
00:49:31.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m31s

means do it in place all right so this
00:49:32.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m32s

is say create a random uniform random
00:49:35.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m35s

number of an appropriate size for this
00:49:38.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m38s

tensor and don't return it but actually
00:49:41.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m41s

fill in that matrix unless okay so
00:49:45.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m45s

that's a super handy thing to know about
00:49:49.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m49s

I mean it wouldn't be rocket science
00:49:51.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m51s

otherwise we would have to have gone
00:49:53.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m53s

[Music]
00:49:59.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m59s

okay here's the non in-place version
00:50:02.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m02s

that's what saves us some typing saves
00:50:05.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m05s

us some screen noise that's all okay so
00:50:07.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m07s

now we've got our randomly initialized
00:50:15.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m15s

embedding weight matrices and so now the
00:50:18.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m18s

forward I'm actually going to use the
00:50:21.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m21s

same columnar model data that we used
00:50:24.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m24s

for Russman and so it's actually going
00:50:27.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m27s

to be passed both categorical variables
00:50:31.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m31s

and continuous variables and in this
00:50:32.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m32s

case there are no continuous variables
00:50:35.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m35s

so I'm just going to grab the 0th column
00:50:38.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m38s

out of the categorical variables and
00:50:41.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m41s

call it users and the first column and
00:50:43.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m43s

call it movies okay so I'm just kind of
00:50:45.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m45s

too lazy to create my own I've lots to
00:50:48.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m48s

do about too lazy out that we do have a
00:50:50.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m50s

special class with this but I'm trying
00:50:52.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m52s

to avoid creating a special class so
00:50:53.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m53s

just going to leverage this columnar
00:50:55.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m55s

model data plus okay so we can basically
00:50:57.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m57s

grab our user and movies mini-batches
00:51:01.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m01s

right and remember this is not a single
00:51:04.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m04s

user in a single movie this is going to
00:51:07.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m07s

be a whole mini batch of them we can now
00:51:08.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m08s

look up that mini batch of users in our
00:51:13.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m13s

embedding matrix U and the movies in are
00:51:15.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m15s

embedding matrix okay so this is like
00:51:18.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m18s

exactly the same is just doing an array
00:51:21.689
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m21s

lookup to grab the user ID numbered
00:51:23.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m23s

value but we're doing that a whole mini
00:51:27.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m27s

batch at a time right and so it's
00:51:29.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m29s

because PI torch can do a whole mini
00:51:31.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m31s

batch at a time with pretty much
00:51:33.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m33s

everything that we can get really easy
00:51:34.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m34s

speed up we don't have to write any
00:51:36.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m36s

loops on the whole to do everything
00:51:39.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m39s

through our mini batch and in fact if
00:51:41.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m41s

you do ever loop through your mini batch
00:51:43.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m43s

manually you don't get GPU acceleration
00:51:45.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m45s

that's really important to know right so
00:51:48.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m48s

you never want to loop have a for loop
00:51:50.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m50s

going through your mini batch you always
00:51:52.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m52s

want to do things in this kind of like
00:51:54.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m54s

whole mini batch at a time but pretty
00:51:56.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m56s

much everything imply torch does things
00:51:59.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m59s

are holding events at a time so you
00:52:01.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m01s

shouldn't have to worry about it
00:52:03.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m03s

and then here's our product just like
00:52:05.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m05s

before right so having to find that I'm
00:52:08.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m08s

now going to go ahead and say alright my
00:52:14.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m14s

X values is everything except the rating
00:52:18.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m18s

and the timestamp in my writings table
00:52:22.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m22s

my Y is my rating and then I can just
00:52:24.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m24s

say okay let's grab a model data from a
00:52:27.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m27s

data frame using that X and that Y and
00:52:30.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m30s

here is our list of categorical
00:52:33.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m33s

variables okay and then so let's now
00:52:36.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m36s

instantiate that PI torch object alright
00:52:43.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m43s

so we've now created that from scratch
00:52:47.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m47s

and then the next thing we need to do is
00:52:49.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m49s

to create an optimizer so this is part
00:52:52.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m52s

of pi torch the only fast AI thing here
00:52:55.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m55s

is this line right because that's like I
00:53:00.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m00s

don't think showing you how to build
00:53:02.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m02s

data sets and data load is interesting
00:53:05.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m05s

enough really we might do that in part
00:53:07.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m07s

two of the course and
00:53:09.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m09s

it's actually so straightforward like a
00:53:11.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m11s

lot of you are already doing it on the
00:53:12.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m12s

forums so I'm not going to show you that
00:53:14.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m14s

in this part but if you're interested
00:53:17.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m17s

feel free to talk on the forums about it
00:53:19.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m19s

but I'm just going to basically take the
00:53:21.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m21s

thing that feeds us data is a given
00:53:24.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m24s

particularly cuz these things are so
00:53:26.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m26s

flexible right you know if you've got
00:53:27.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m27s

stuff enough data frame you can just use
00:53:29.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m29s

this you don't have to rewrite it so
00:53:31.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m31s

that's the only fast AI thing we're
00:53:34.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m34s

using so this is a PI torch thing and so
00:53:35.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m35s

optiom is the thing and pi torch that
00:53:39.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m39s

gives us an optimizer will be learning
00:53:42.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m42s

about that very shortly so it's actually
00:53:44.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m44s

the thing that's going to update our
00:53:48.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m48s

weights pi torch calls them the
00:53:49.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m49s

parameters of the model so earlier on we
00:53:54.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m54s

set model equals embedding dot blah blah
00:53:58.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m58s

right and because embedding dot derives
00:54:01.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m01s

from NN module we get all of the pi
00:54:04.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m04s

torch module behavior and one of the
00:54:07.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m07s

things we got for free is the ability to
00:54:10.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m10s

say got parameters so that's pretty
00:54:12.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m12s

that's pretty any right that's the thing
00:54:16.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m16s

that basically is going to automatically
00:54:19.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m19s

give us a list of all of the weights in
00:54:21.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m21s

our model that have to be updated and so
00:54:24.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m24s

that's what gets passed to the optimizer
00:54:27.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m27s

we also passed the optimized at the
00:54:29.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m29s

learning rate the weight decay which
00:54:31.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m31s

we'll talk about later and momentum that
00:54:34.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m34s

we'll talk about later okay one other
00:54:37.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m37s

thing that I'm not going to do right now
00:54:42.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m42s

but we will do later is to write a
00:54:43.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m43s

training loop so the training loop is a
00:54:45.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m45s

thing that lives for each mini batch and
00:54:48.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m48s

updates the weight to subtract the
00:54:51.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m51s

gradient times the moment there's a
00:54:54.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m54s

function in fast AI which is the
00:54:58.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m58s

training loop and it's it's pretty
00:55:01.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m01s

simple here it is right for a POC in
00:55:07.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m07s

epochs this is just the thing that shows
00:55:12.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m12s

a progress bar so ignore this for X
00:55:16.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m16s

comma Y in my training data loader
00:55:18.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m18s

calculate the loss
00:55:21.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m21s

print out the lots you know in a
00:55:25.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m25s

progress bar call any callbacks you have
00:55:28.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m28s

and at the end call the call the metrics
00:55:32.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m32s

on the validation alright so there's
00:55:37.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m37s

there's just eh
00:55:39.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m39s

Apoc go through each mini batch and do
00:55:41.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m41s

one step of optimizer step is basically
00:55:46.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m46s

going to take advantage of this
00:55:50.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m50s

optimizer but we'll be writing that from
00:55:52.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m52s

scratch shortly so this is notice we're
00:55:54.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m54s

not using a learner okay we're just
00:55:58.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m58s

using a hi book module so this this fit
00:56:00.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m00s

thing although it's passed to a part of
00:56:04.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m04s

fast AI it's like lower down the layers
00:56:05.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m05s

of abstraction now this is the thing
00:56:09.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m09s

that takes a regular high torch model so
00:56:10.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m10s

if you ever want to like skip as much
00:56:14.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m14s

faster eye stuff as possible like you've
00:56:19.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m19s

got some high torch model you've got
00:56:21.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m21s

some code on the internet you basically
00:56:23.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m23s

want to run it that you don't want to
00:56:24.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m24s

write your own training loop then this
00:56:27.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m27s

is this is what you want to do you want
00:56:29.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m29s

to call fast a high speed version and so
00:56:30.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m30s

what you'll find is like the library is
00:56:33.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m33s

designed so that you can kind of dig in
00:56:35.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m35s

at any layer abstraction you like right
00:56:37.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m37s

and so at this layer of abstraction
00:56:41.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m41s

you're not going to get things like
00:56:43.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m43s

stochastic gradient descent with
00:56:46.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m46s

restarts you're not going to get like
00:56:47.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m47s

differential learning rates like all
00:56:49.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m49s

that stuff that's in the learner like
00:56:51.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m51s

you could do it but you'd have to write
00:56:53.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m53s

it all about by hand yourself alright
00:56:55.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m55s

and that's the downside of kind of going
00:56:57.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m57s

down to this level of abstraction the
00:56:59.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m59s

upside is that as you saw the code for
00:57:02.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m02s

this is very simple it's just a simple
00:57:04.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m04s

training loop it takes a standard 5
00:57:06.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m06s

torch model so this is like this is a
00:57:08.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m08s

good thing for us to use here we can we
00:57:11.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m11s

just call it and it looks exactly like
00:57:13.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m13s

what we used to see all right we got our
00:57:15.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m15s

validation and training loss for the 3 e
00:57:19.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m19s

bus now you'll notice that we wanted
00:57:22.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m22s

something around 0.76 so we're not there
00:57:29.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m29s

so in other words the the the default
00:57:34.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m34s

fast AI collaborative dory
00:57:37.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m37s

rhythm is doing something smarter than
00:57:38.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m38s

this so we're going to try and do that
00:57:41.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m41s

one thing that we can do since we're
00:57:44.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m44s

calling our you know this lower level
00:57:46.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m46s

fifth function there's no learning rate
00:57:49.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m49s

and kneeling we could do our own
00:57:50.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m50s

learning rate annealing so you can hear
00:57:52.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m52s

it see here there's a first day I
00:57:54.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m54s

function called set learning rates you
00:57:55.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m55s

can pass in a standard height watch
00:57:57.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m57s

optimizer and pass in your new learning
00:57:59.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m59s

rate and then call fit again and so this
00:58:02.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m02s

is how we can let manually do a learning
00:58:05.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m05s

rate schedule and so you can see we've
00:58:08.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m08s

got a little bit better 1.13 where you
00:58:10.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m10s

still got a long way to go okay so I
00:58:13.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m13s

think what we might do is we might have
00:58:18.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m18s

a seven minute break and then we're
00:58:20.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m20s

going to come back and try and improve
00:58:24.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m24s

this core of it for those who are
00:58:27.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m27s

interested somebody was asking me the
00:58:38.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m38s

break for a kind of a quick walkthrough
00:58:39.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m39s

so this is totally optional but if you
00:58:42.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m42s

go into the first day I library there's
00:58:45.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m45s

a model py file and that's where fit is
00:58:47.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m47s

which we're just looking at which goes
00:58:54.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m54s

through each epoch in epochs and then
00:58:57.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m57s

goes through each x and y in the mini
00:59:01.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m01s

batch and then it calls this step
00:59:03.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m03s

function so the step function is here
00:59:07.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m07s

and you can see the key thing is it
00:59:15.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m15s

calculates the output from the model the
00:59:17.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m17s

models for M right and so if you
00:59:19.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m19s

remember our dot product we didn't
00:59:20.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m20s

actually call model dot forward we just
00:59:26.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m26s

called model parentheses and that's
00:59:28.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m28s

because the N n dot module automatically
00:59:30.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m30s

you know when you call it as if it's a
00:59:35.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m35s

function it passes it along to forward
00:59:37.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m37s

okay so that's that's what that's doing
00:59:39.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m39s

there right and then the rest of this
00:59:42.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m42s

world will learn about shortly which is
00:59:44.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m44s

basically doing the the loss function
00:59:45.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m45s

and
00:59:49.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m49s

the backward pass okay so for those who
00:59:50.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m50s

are interested that's that's kind of
00:59:53.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m53s

gets you a bit of a sense of how the
00:59:55.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m55s

cone it's structured if you want to look
00:59:57.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m57s

at it and as I say like the the faster I
00:59:59.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m59s

code is designed to both be world-class
01:00:02.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m02s

performance but also pretty easy to read
01:00:06.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m06s

so like feel free like take a look at it
01:00:09.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m09s

and if you want to know what's going on
01:00:13.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m13s

just ask on the forums and if you you
01:00:15.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m15s

know if you think is anything that could
01:00:18.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m18s

be clearer let us know because yeah the
01:00:19.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m19s

code is definitely now we're going to be
01:00:25.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m25s

digging into the code or in law okay so
01:00:26.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m26s

let's try and improve this a little bit
01:00:31.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m31s

and let's start off by improving it in
01:00:33.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m33s

Excel so you might have noticed here
01:00:36.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m36s

that we've kind of got the idea that use
01:00:40.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m40s

a 72
01:00:43.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m43s

you know like sci-fi modern movies with
01:00:44.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m44s

special effects you know whatever and
01:00:48.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m48s

movie number 27 is sci-fi and that
01:00:50.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m50s

special effects so much dialogue but
01:00:53.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m53s

we're missing an important case which is
01:00:57.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m57s

like user 72 is pretty enthusiastic on
01:01:00.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m00s

the hall and on average rates things
01:01:05.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m05s

higher and Highland you know and movie
01:01:07.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m07s

27 you know it's just a popular movie
01:01:10.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m10s

you know it's just on average its higher
01:01:14.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m14s

so what would really like is to add a
01:01:17.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m17s

constant for the user and a constant for
01:01:20.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m20s

the movie and remember in neural network
01:01:24.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m24s

terms we call that a bias that's what we
01:01:26.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m26s

want to add a bias so we could easily do
01:01:29.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m29s

that and if we go into the bias tab here
01:01:32.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m32s

we've got the same data as before and
01:01:35.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m35s

we've got the same latent factors as
01:01:37.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m37s

before and I've just got one extra row
01:01:41.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m41s

here and one extra column here and you
01:01:44.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m44s

won't be surprised here that we now take
01:01:48.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m48s

these same matrix multiplication as
01:01:51.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m51s

before and we add in that and we add in
01:01:53.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m53s

that okay so that's
01:01:58.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m58s

bias so other than that we've got
01:02:01.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m01s

exactly the same loss function over here
01:02:05.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m05s

and so just like before we can now go
01:02:07.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m07s

ahead and solve that and now our
01:02:11.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m11s

changing variables include the bias and
01:02:14.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m14s

we can say solve and if we leave that
01:02:18.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m18s

for a little while it will come to a
01:02:20.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m20s

better result than we had before
01:02:23.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m23s

okay so that's the first thing we're
01:02:27.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m27s

going to do to improve our model and
01:02:30.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m30s

there's really very little show just to
01:02:32.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m32s

make the code a bit shorter I have to
01:02:37.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m37s

find a function called get embedding
01:02:41.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m41s

which takes a number of inputs and a
01:02:43.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m43s

number of factors so the number of rows
01:02:46.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m46s

and the embedding matrix Nomos they're
01:02:48.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m48s

both medications creates the embedding
01:02:50.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m50s

and then randomly initializes it I don't
01:02:52.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m52s

know why I'm doing negative to positive
01:02:57.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m57s

here and it zeroed last time honestly it
01:02:59.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m59s

doesn't matter much as long as it's in
01:03:00.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m00s

the right ballpark and then we return
01:03:02.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m02s

that initialized emitting so now we need
01:03:05.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m05s

not just our users by factors which are
01:03:09.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m09s

Chuck into you our movies by factors
01:03:11.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m11s

which I've shocked into M but we also
01:03:14.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m14s

need users by one which will put into UV
01:03:16.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m16s

user bias and movies by one which will
01:03:20.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m20s

put into the movie bias okay so this is
01:03:23.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m23s

just doing a list comprehension going
01:03:25.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m25s

through each of the tuples create an
01:03:28.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m28s

embedding for each of them and putting
01:03:29.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m29s

them into these things okay so now our
01:03:31.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m31s

forward is exactly the same as before u
01:03:34.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m34s

times M sub I mean this is actually a
01:03:40.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m40s

little confusing because we're doing it
01:03:44.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m44s

into two steps maybe they make it a bit
01:03:45.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m45s

easier let's pull this out
01:03:50.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m50s

put it up here put this in parentheses
01:03:51.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m51s

okay so maybe that looks a little bit
01:03:58.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m58s

more familiar all right you times n dot
01:04:00.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m00s

some that's the same dot product and
01:04:02.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m02s

then here it is going to add in our user
01:04:04.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m04s

pious and
01:04:07.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m07s

our movie bus dot squeeze is the PI
01:04:08.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m08s

torch thing that adds an additional unit
01:04:14.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m14s

axis that's not going to make any sense
01:04:17.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m17s

if you haven't done broadcasting before
01:04:21.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m21s

I'm not going to do a broadcasting in
01:04:23.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m23s

this course because we've already done
01:04:25.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m25s

it
01:04:27.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m27s

and we're doing it in the machine
01:04:28.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m28s

learning course but basically in in
01:04:29.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m29s

short broadcasting is what happens when
01:04:31.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m31s

you do something like this where um is a
01:04:34.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m34s

matrix you be self-taught you the users
01:04:36.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m36s

is a is a vector how do you add a vector
01:04:40.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m40s

to a matrix and basically what it does
01:04:44.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m44s

is it duplicates the vector so that it
01:04:46.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m46s

makes it the same size as the matrix and
01:04:51.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m51s

the particular way whether it duplicates
01:04:53.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m53s

it across columns or down rows or how it
01:04:55.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m55s

does it is called broadcasting the
01:04:58.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m58s

broadcasting rules are the same as numpy
01:05:00.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m00s

Pytor didn't actually used to support
01:05:03.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m03s

broadcasting so I was actually the guy
01:05:05.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m05s

who first added broadcasting to PI torch
01:05:07.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m07s

using an ugly hack and then the pipe or
01:05:09.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m09s

authors did an awesome job of supporting
01:05:11.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m11s

it actually inside the language so now
01:05:13.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m13s

you can use the same broadcasting
01:05:17.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m17s

operations in five torches non-player if
01:05:19.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m19s

you haven't dealt with this before it's
01:05:22.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m22s

really important to learn it because
01:05:24.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m24s

like it's it's kind of the most
01:05:27.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m27s

important fundamental way to do
01:05:29.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m29s

computations quickly in the high-end
01:05:31.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m31s

paid warship it's the thing that lets
01:05:34.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m34s

you not have to do loops
01:05:35.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m35s

how could you imagine here if I had to
01:05:37.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m37s

look through every row of this matrix
01:05:38.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m38s

and add each did you know this vector to
01:05:40.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m40s

every row it would be slow the you know
01:05:43.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m43s

a lot more code and the idea of
01:05:46.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m46s

broadcasting it actually goes all the
01:05:50.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m50s

way back to APL which was a language
01:05:52.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m52s

designed in the 50s by an extraordinary
01:05:54.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m54s

guy called Ken Iverson yeah APL was
01:05:56.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m56s

originally designed or written out as a
01:05:59.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m59s

new type of mathematical notation he has
01:06:02.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m02s

this great essay called notation as a
01:06:05.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m05s

tool for thought and the idea was that
01:06:08.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m08s

like really good notation could actually
01:06:10.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m10s

make you think of better things and part
01:06:12.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m12s

of that notation is this idea of
01:06:15.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m15s

broadcasting I'm incredibly enthusiastic
01:06:17.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m17s

about it
01:06:20.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m20s

and we're gonna use it plenty so either
01:06:21.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m21s

watch the machine learning lesson or you
01:06:25.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m25s

know google numpy broadcasting for
01:06:30.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m30s

information anyway
01:06:33.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m33s

so basically it works reasonably
01:06:36.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m36s

intuitively we can add on we can add the
01:06:37.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m37s

vectors to the matrix all right
01:06:40.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m40s

having done that we're now going to do
01:06:46.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m46s

one more trick which is I think it was
01:06:49.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m49s

your net asked earlier about could we
01:06:53.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m53s

squish the ratings to be between one and
01:06:56.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m56s

five and the answer is we could right
01:06:59.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m59s

and specifically what we could do is we
01:07:05.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m05s

could put it through a sigmoid function
01:07:09.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m09s

all right
01:07:12.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m12s

so remind you a sigmoid function looks
01:07:14.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m14s

like that right and this is that's one
01:07:19.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m19s

okay we could put it through a secret
01:07:24.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m24s

function so we could take like four
01:07:27.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m27s

point nine six and put it through a
01:07:29.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m29s

sigmoid function and like that you know
01:07:31.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m31s

that's kind of high so it kind of be
01:07:33.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m33s

over here somewhere right
01:07:35.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m35s

and then we could multiply that sigmoid
01:07:37.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m37s

like the result of that by five for
01:07:41.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m41s

example all right
01:07:44.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m44s

and in this case we want it to be
01:07:46.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m46s

between one and five right so maybe we
01:07:47.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m47s

would multiply it by four and add one
01:07:49.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m49s

instance that's the basic idea and so
01:07:51.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m51s

here is that trick we take the result so
01:07:56.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m56s

the result is basically the the thing
01:08:00.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m00s

that comes straight out of the dot
01:08:01.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m01s

product plus the addition of the biases
01:08:03.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m03s

and put it through a sigmoid function
01:08:05.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m05s

now in pi torch basically all of the
01:08:08.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m08s

functions you can do to tensors are
01:08:13.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m13s

available inside this thing called
01:08:16.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m16s

capital F and this is like totally
01:08:19.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m19s

standard in pi torch it's actually
01:08:21.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m21s

called torch and or functional but
01:08:23.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m23s

everybody including all of the pipe
01:08:26.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m26s

torch Doc's import torch start and end
01:08:28.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m28s

are functional as capital F all right so
01:08:30.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m30s

capital F dot sigmoid means a function
01:08:33.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m33s

called sigmoid that is coming from
01:08:36.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m36s

tortures functional module right and so
01:08:38.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m38s

that's going to apply a sigmoid function
01:08:42.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m42s

for the result so I squish them all
01:08:44.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m44s

between zero and one using that nice
01:08:46.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m46s

little shape and then I can multiply
01:08:48.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m48s

that by five minus one plus four right
01:08:50.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m50s

and then add on one and that's gonna
01:08:54.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m54s

give me plumbing between one and five
01:08:57.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m57s

okay so like there's no need to do this
01:08:58.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m58s

I could comment it out and it'll still
01:09:03.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m03s

work right but now it has to come up
01:09:04.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m04s

with a set of calculations that are
01:09:08.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m08s

always between one and five right where
01:09:09.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m09s

else if I leave this in then it's like
01:09:13.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m13s

makes it really easy it's basically like
01:09:15.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m15s

oh if you think this is a really good
01:09:16.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m16s

movie just calculate a really high
01:09:17.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m17s

number it's a really crappy movies low
01:09:20.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m20s

number and I'll make sure it's in the
01:09:22.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m22s

right regions so even though this is a
01:09:24.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m24s

neural network it's still a good example
01:09:26.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m26s

of this kind of like if you're doing any
01:09:28.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m28s

kind of parameter fitting try and make
01:09:30.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m30s

it so that the thing that you want your
01:09:33.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m33s

function to return it's like it's easy
01:09:35.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m35s

for it to return that okay so that's why
01:09:37.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m37s

we do that that function squishing so we
01:09:40.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m40s

call this embedding dot bias so we can
01:09:44.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m44s

create that in the same way as before
01:09:48.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m48s

you'll see here I'm calling dr. to put
01:09:49.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m49s

it on the GPU because we're not using
01:09:53.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m53s

any learner stuff normally it'll all
01:09:54.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m54s

happen for you but we have to manually
01:09:56.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m56s

say put it on the GPU this is the same
01:09:58.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m58s

as before create our optimizer fit
01:10:01.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m01s

exactly the same as before and these
01:10:03.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m03s

numbers are looking good all right and
01:10:05.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m05s

again we'll do a little change to our
01:10:08.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m08s

learning rate learning rate schedule and
01:10:11.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m11s

we're down to 0.8 so we're actually
01:10:13.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m13s

pretty close pretty close so that's the
01:10:16.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m16s

key steps and this is how this is how
01:10:23.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m23s

most collaborative filtering is done and
01:10:31.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m31s

unit reminded me of an important point
01:10:35.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m35s

which is that this is not strictly
01:10:38.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m38s

speaking a matrix factorization because
01:10:42.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m42s

strictly
01:10:46.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m46s

a matrix factorization would take that
01:10:46.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m46s

matrix by that matrix to create this
01:10:49.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m49s

matrix and remembering anywhere that
01:10:54.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m54s

this is empty like here or here we're
01:11:03.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m03s

putting in a zero right we're saying if
01:11:08.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m08s

the original was empty put in a zero
01:11:11.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m11s

right now normally you can't do that
01:11:14.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m14s

with normal matrix factorization normal
01:11:18.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m18s

matrix factorization it creates the
01:11:20.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m20s

whole matrix and so it was a real
01:11:22.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m22s

problem actually when people used to try
01:11:25.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m25s

and use traditional linear algebra for
01:11:27.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m27s

this because when you have these sparse
01:11:29.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m29s

matrices like in practice
01:11:31.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m31s

this matrix is not doesn't have many
01:11:33.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m33s

gaps because we picked the users that
01:11:36.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m36s

watch the most movies and the movies
01:11:38.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m38s

that are the most watched but if you
01:11:40.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m40s

look at the whole matrix it's it's
01:11:42.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m42s

mainly empty and so traditional
01:11:43.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m43s

techniques treated empty is zero and so
01:11:46.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m46s

like you basically have to predict a
01:11:49.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m49s

zero as if the fact that I haven't
01:11:51.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m51s

watched a movie means I don't like the
01:11:54.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m54s

movie that's gives terrible answers so
01:11:55.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m55s

this probabilistic matrix factorization
01:11:58.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m58s

approach takes advantage of the fact
01:12:01.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m01s

that our data structure actually looks
01:12:05.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m05s

like this rather than that cross tab
01:12:08.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m08s

right and so it's only calculating the
01:12:11.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m11s

loss for the user ID movie ID
01:12:13.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m13s

combinations that actually appear that's
01:12:16.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m16s

its if you like use red a1 movie I think
01:12:18.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m18s

102 9 should be 3 it's actually three
01:12:20.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m20s

and a half sauce is 0.5 like there's
01:12:22.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m22s

nothing here that's ever going to
01:12:25.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m25s

calculate a prediction or a loss for a
01:12:27.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m27s

user movie combination that doesn't
01:12:30.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m30s

appear in this table by definition the
01:12:32.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m32s

only stuff that we can appear in a mini
01:12:36.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m36s

batch is what's in this table okay and
01:12:38.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m38s

like a lot of this happened
01:12:45.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m45s

interestingly enough actually in the
01:12:46.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m46s

Netflix price so before the Netflix
01:12:48.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m48s

prize came along there's probabilistic
01:12:50.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m50s

matrix factorization it had actually
01:12:54.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m54s

already been invented but nobody noticed
01:12:56.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m56s

all right and then in the
01:12:59.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m59s

first year of the Netflix price someone
01:13:00.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m00s

wrote this like really really famous
01:13:02.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m02s

blog post where they basically said like
01:13:04.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m04s

hey check this out
01:13:06.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m06s

incredibly simple technique works
01:13:08.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m08s

incredibly well when suddenly all the
01:13:10.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m10s

net fix leaderboard entries and so
01:13:12.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m12s

that's quite a few years ago now and
01:13:17.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m17s

this is like now every collaborative
01:13:19.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m19s

filtering approach does this not every
01:13:21.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m21s

collaborative filtering approach adds
01:13:23.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m23s

this sigmoid thing by the way it's not
01:13:25.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m25s

like rocket science this is this is not
01:13:27.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m27s

like the NLP thing we saw last week
01:13:30.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m30s

which is like hey this is a new
01:13:32.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m32s

state-of-the-art like this is you know
01:13:33.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m33s

not particularly uncommon but there are
01:13:35.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m35s

still people that don't do this it
01:13:37.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m37s

definitely helps a lot I have to have
01:13:39.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m39s

this and so actually you know what we
01:13:41.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m41s

could do is maybe now's a good time to
01:13:45.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m45s

have a look at the definition of this
01:13:47.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m47s

right so the column data module contains
01:13:50.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m50s

all these definitions and we can now
01:13:56.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m56s

compare this to the thing we originally
01:14:00.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m00s

used which was whatever came out of
01:14:03.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m03s

collaborative data set all right so
01:14:07.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m07s

let's go to collab filter data set here
01:14:09.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m09s

it is and we called get learner all
01:14:16.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m16s

right so we can go down to get Elena and
01:14:20.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m20s

that created a collab filter learner
01:14:22.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m22s

passing in the model from get model is
01:14:27.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m27s

get model so created an embedding bias
01:14:29.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m29s

and so here is embedding drop bias and
01:14:32.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m32s

you can see here here it is like it's
01:14:37.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m37s

the same thing there's the embedding for
01:14:40.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m40s

each of the things here's our forward
01:14:42.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m42s

that does the you times I dot some plus
01:14:44.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m44s

plus sigmoid so in fact we have just
01:14:49.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m49s

actually rebuilt what's in the past our
01:14:52.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m52s

library literally okay it's a little
01:14:55.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m55s

shorter and easier because we're taking
01:15:00.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m00s

advantage of the fact that there's a
01:15:03.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m03s

special collaborative filtering data set
01:15:04.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m04s

so we can actually we're getting past in
01:15:08.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m08s

the users and the items and we don't
01:15:11.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m11s

have to pull them out of cat
01:15:12.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m12s

Kant's but other than that this is
01:15:13.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m13s

exactly the same so hopefully you can
01:15:16.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m16s

see like the faster you have ivory is
01:15:18.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m18s

not some inscrutable code containing
01:15:20.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m20s

concepts you can never understand we've
01:15:22.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m22s

actually just built up this entire thing
01:15:24.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m24s

from scratch ourselves and so why did we
01:15:26.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m26s

get 0.76 rather than 0.8 you know I I
01:15:31.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m31s

think it's simply because we used
01:15:38.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m38s

stochastic gradient descent with
01:15:40.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m40s

restarts or the cycle multiplier and an
01:15:41.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m41s

atom optimizer you know like a few
01:15:44.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m44s

little training chase some I'm looking
01:15:46.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m46s

at this and thinking that is we could
01:15:51.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m51s

totally improve this small but maybe
01:15:54.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m54s

looking at the date and doing some
01:15:58.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m58s

tricks with the date because this this
01:16:00.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m00s

is kind of a just a regular kind of
01:16:02.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m02s

smaller no way yeah you can add more
01:16:05.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m05s

features yeah exactly exactly so like
01:16:08.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m08s

now that you've seen this you could now
01:16:10.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m10s

you know even if you didn't have
01:16:13.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m13s

embedding dot bias in a notebook that
01:16:15.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m15s

you've written yourself through some
01:16:18.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m18s

other model that's in fast AI you could
01:16:19.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m19s

look at it in faster and be like oh that
01:16:21.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m21s

does most of the things that I'd want to
01:16:23.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m23s

do but it doesn't deal with time and so
01:16:25.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m25s

you could just go oh okay let's grab it
01:16:28.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m28s

copy it you know pop it into my notebook
01:16:29.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m29s

and let's create you know the better
01:16:33.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m33s

version all right and then you can start
01:16:36.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m36s

playing that and you can now create your
01:16:38.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m38s

own model class from the open source
01:16:41.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m41s

code here and so yeah your that's
01:16:46.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m46s

mentioning a couple things we could do
01:16:49.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m49s

we could try and incorporate in time
01:16:50.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m50s

stamp so we could assume that maybe well
01:16:52.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m52s

maybe there's just like some for a
01:16:55.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m55s

particular user over time users tend to
01:16:57.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m57s

get more or less positive about movies
01:17:00.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m00s

also remember there was the list of
01:17:03.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m03s

genres for each movie maybe we could
01:17:06.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m06s

incorporate that so one problem is it's
01:17:08.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m08s

a little bit difficult to incorporate
01:17:12.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m12s

that stuff into this embedding bias
01:17:13.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m13s

model because it's kind of it's pretty
01:17:17.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m17s

custom right so what we're going to do
01:17:19.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m19s

next is we're going to try to create a
01:17:21.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m21s

neural net version
01:17:25.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m25s

of this hey so the basic idea here is
01:17:27.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m27s

we're going to take exactly the same
01:17:33.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m33s

thing as we had before here's our list
01:17:36.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m36s

of users right and here is Erin Bates
01:17:38.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m38s

alright and here's our list of movies
01:17:43.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m43s

and here is our embedded right and so as
01:17:46.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m46s

you can see I've just kind of transposed
01:17:51.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m51s

the movie ones so that so that they're
01:17:52.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m52s

all in the same orientation and here is
01:17:55.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m55s

our user movie rating but D cross tab
01:17:58.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m58s

okay so in the original format so each
01:18:02.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m02s

row is a user movie rating okay so the
01:18:05.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m05s

first thing I do is I need to replace
01:18:10.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m10s

user 14 with that users contiguous in
01:18:13.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m13s

this right and so I can do that in Excel
01:18:19.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m19s

using this match that basically says
01:18:22.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m22s

what you know how far down this list do
01:18:25.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m25s

you have to go and it said user 14 was
01:18:27.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m27s

the first thing in that list okay
01:18:31.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m31s

user 29 was the second thing in that
01:18:34.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m34s

list so forth okay so this is the same
01:18:36.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m36s

as that thing that we did in our Python
01:18:39.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m39s

code where we basically created a
01:18:43.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m43s

dictionary to master so now we can for
01:18:45.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m45s

this particular user movie rating
01:18:49.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m49s

combination we can look up the
01:18:52.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m52s

appropriate embedding right and so you
01:18:54.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m54s

can see here what it's doing is it's
01:18:58.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m58s

saying
01:19:01.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m01s

all right let's basically offset from
01:19:01.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m01s

the start of this list and the number of
01:19:05.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m05s

rows we're going to go down is equal to
01:19:08.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m08s

the user index and the number of columns
01:19:10.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m10s

we're going to go across is one two
01:19:12.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m12s

three four or five okay and so you can
01:19:14.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m14s

see what it does is it creates point one
01:19:16.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m16s

nine point six three point three one
01:19:18.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m18s

here it is point one nine point okay so
01:19:19.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m19s

so this is literally modern embedding
01:19:22.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m22s

this but remember this is exactly the
01:19:25.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m25s

same as doing a one hot encoding right
01:19:29.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m29s

because if instead this was a vector
01:19:34.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m34s

containing one zero zero zero zero
01:19:37.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m37s

right and we multiplied that by this
01:19:40.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m40s

matrix then the only row it's going to
01:19:44.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m44s

return would be the first one okay so so
01:19:46.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m46s

it's really useful to remember that
01:19:51.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m51s

embedding actually just is a matrix
01:19:53.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m53s

product the only reason it exists the
01:19:56.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m56s

only reason it exists is because this is
01:19:59.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m59s

an optimization you know this let's pipe
01:20:02.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m02s

or to know like okay this is just a
01:20:04.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m04s

matrix multiply but I guarantee you that
01:20:07.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m07s

you know this thing is one hard encoded
01:20:10.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m10s

therefore you don't have to actually do
01:20:13.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m13s

the matrix multiply you can just do a
01:20:15.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m15s

directory of that okay so that's
01:20:16.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m16s

literally all an embedding is is it is a
01:20:19.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m19s

computational performance thing for a
01:20:21.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m21s

particular kind of matrix multiplier all
01:20:26.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m26s

right so that looks up that uses user
01:20:28.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m28s

and then we can look up that users movie
01:20:31.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m31s

all right so here is movie ID movie ID
01:20:34.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m34s

four one seven which apparently is
01:20:38.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m38s

indexed number fourteen here it is here
01:20:41.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m41s

so it should have been point seven five
01:20:43.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m43s

point four seven yes it is point seven
01:20:45.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m45s

five point plus it okay
01:20:47.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m47s

so we've now got the user embedding and
01:20:49.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m49s

the movie embedding and rather than
01:20:52.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m52s

doing a dot product of those two okay
01:20:55.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m55s

which is what we do normally instead
01:21:02.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m02s

what if we concatenate the two together
01:21:06.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m06s

into a single vector of length 10 and
01:21:09.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m09s

then feed that into a neural net okay
01:21:15.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m15s

and so anytime we've got you know a
01:21:19.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m19s

tensor of import activations or in this
01:21:24.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m24s

case a tensor of actually this is a
01:21:27.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m27s

tensor of output activations this is
01:21:30.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m30s

coming out of an embedding layer we can
01:21:31.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m31s

chuck it in a neural net because neural
01:21:34.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m34s

Nets we now know can calculate anything
01:21:35.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m35s

okay including hopefully collaborative
01:21:40.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m40s

filtering so let's try that so here is
01:21:43.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m43s

our embedding net so
01:21:46.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m46s

this time I have not bothered to create
01:21:51.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m51s

a separate bias because instead the
01:21:54.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m54s

linear layer in pi torch already has a
01:22:01.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m01s

bias in it all right so when we go NN
01:22:05.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m05s

Linea right that's kind of draw this out
01:22:10.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m10s

so we've got our U matrix right and this
01:22:18.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m18s

is the number of users and this is the
01:22:24.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m24s

number of factors right and we've got
01:22:27.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m27s

our M matrix that so here's our number
01:22:31.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m31s

of movies and here's our again number of
01:22:36.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m36s

factors okay and so remember we look up
01:22:39.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m39s

a single user we look up a single movie
01:22:42.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m42s

and let's grab them and concatenate them
01:22:50.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m50s

together okay so here's like the user
01:22:53.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m53s

part here's the movie part and then
01:22:57.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m57s

let's put that through a matrix product
01:23:00.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m00s

right so that number of rows here is
01:23:05.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m05s

going to have to be the number of users
01:23:08.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m08s

plus the number of movies right because
01:23:09.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m09s

that's how long that is and then the
01:23:12.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m12s

number of columns can be anything we
01:23:14.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m14s

want because we're going to take that so
01:23:18.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m18s

in this case we're going to pick 10
01:23:23.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m23s

apparently so it's pick 10 and then
01:23:25.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m25s

we're going to stick that through a rail
01:23:27.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m27s

you and then stick that through another
01:23:30.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m30s

matrix which obviously needs to be of
01:23:34.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m34s

size 10 here and then the number of
01:23:37.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m37s

columns is a size 1 because we want to
01:23:40.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m40s

predict a single rating okay and so
01:23:43.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m43s

that's our kind of flow chart of what's
01:23:51.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m51s

going on right it is a standard I'm
01:23:54.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m54s

called a one hidden layer neural net it
01:23:58.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m58s

depends how you think of it like there's
01:24:00.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m00s

kind of an embedding layer but because
01:24:02.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m02s

is linear and this is linear the two
01:24:05.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m05s

together is really one linear layer
01:24:07.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m07s

right this just a computational
01:24:09.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m09s

convenience so it's really got one
01:24:11.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m11s

hidden layer because it's got one layer
01:24:14.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m14s

before this nonlinear activation so in
01:24:15.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m15s

order to create a linear layer with some
01:24:21.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m21s

number of rows and some number of
01:24:26.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m26s

columns you just go in and on in the
01:24:27.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m27s

machine learning class this week we
01:24:31.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m31s

learnt how to create a linear layer from
01:24:34.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m34s

scratch by creating our own weight
01:24:37.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m37s

matrix and our own biases so if you want
01:24:39.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m39s

to check that out you couldn't do so
01:24:41.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m41s

there right but it's the same basic
01:24:43.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m43s

technique we've already seen so we
01:24:46.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m46s

create our embeddings we create our two
01:24:51.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m51s

linear layers that's all the stuff that
01:24:52.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m52s

we need to start with you know really if
01:24:55.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m55s

I wanted to make this more general I
01:24:57.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m57s

would have had another parameter here
01:24:59.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m59s

called like num hidden you know equals
01:25:01.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m01s

equals 10 and then this would be a
01:25:08.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m08s

parameter and then you could like more
01:25:11.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m11s

easily play around with different
01:25:14.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m14s

numbers of activations so when we say
01:25:16.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m16s

like okay in this layer I'm going to
01:25:18.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m18s

create a layer with this many
01:25:20.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m20s

activations all I mean assuming it's a
01:25:21.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m21s

fully connected layer is my linear layer
01:25:25.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m25s

has how many columns in its weight
01:25:28.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m28s

matrix that's how many activations it
01:25:30.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m30s

creates all right so we grab our users
01:25:32.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m32s

and movies we put them through our
01:25:36.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m36s

embedding matrix and then we concatenate
01:25:38.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m38s

them together
01:25:40.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m40s

okay so torch cat concatenate them
01:25:41.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m41s

together on the first dimension so in
01:25:44.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m44s

other words we concatenate the columns
01:25:47.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m47s

together to create longer rows okay so
01:25:48.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m48s

that's concatenating on dimension one
01:25:52.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m52s

drop out we'll come back to her in a
01:25:56.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m56s

moment we've got that briefly
01:25:58.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m58s

so then having done that we'll put it
01:26:01.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m01s

through that linear layer we had we'll
01:26:04.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m04s

do our value and you'll notice that
01:26:07.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m07s

value is again inside our capital F and
01:26:10.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m10s

end up optional right it's just a
01:26:14.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m14s

function
01:26:15.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m15s

so remember activation function
01:26:16.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m16s

are basically things that take one
01:26:18.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m18s

activation in and spit one activation
01:26:20.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m20s

out in this case taking something that
01:26:23.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m23s

can have negatives or positives and
01:26:26.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m26s

truncate the negatives to zero that's
01:26:28.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m28s

what well you does and then here's a
01:26:30.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m30s

sigmoid so that's that that is now a
01:26:34.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m34s

genuine neural network I don't know if I
01:26:39.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m39s

get to call it deep it's only got one
01:26:42.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m42s

hidden layer but it's definitely a
01:26:44.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m44s

neural network all right and so we can
01:26:45.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m45s

now construct it we can put it on the
01:26:48.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m48s

GPU you can create an optimizer for it
01:26:50.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m50s

and we can fit it now you'll notice
01:26:52.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m52s

there's one other thing I've been
01:26:56.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m56s

passing to fit which is what loss
01:26:57.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m57s

function are we trying to minimize okay
01:27:00.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m00s

this is the mean squared error loss and
01:27:03.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m03s

again it's inside F okay pretty much all
01:27:05.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m05s

the functions are inside it okay so one
01:27:08.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m08s

of the things that you have to pass fit
01:27:12.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m12s

is something saying like how do you
01:27:14.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m14s

score it's what counts as good or bad so
01:27:16.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m16s

it should I mean now that we have a real
01:27:20.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m20s

neural net do we have to use the same
01:27:23.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m23s

number of embeddings for users and
01:27:25.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m25s

that's a great question you don't know
01:27:27.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m27s

absolutely right
01:27:30.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m30s

you don't and so like we've got a lot of
01:27:31.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m31s

benefits here right because if we you
01:27:34.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m34s

know think about you know we're grabbing
01:27:38.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m38s

a user embedding or concatenating it
01:27:45.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m45s

with a movie embedding which maybe is
01:27:48.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m48s

like some different size but then also
01:27:50.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m50s

perhaps we looked up the genre of the
01:27:54.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m54s

movie and like you know there's actually
01:27:57.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m57s

a embedding matrix of like number of
01:27:59.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m59s

genres by I don't know three or
01:28:02.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m02s

something and so like we could then
01:28:06.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m06s

concatenate like a genre embedding and
01:28:07.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m07s

then maybe the timestamp is in here as a
01:28:09.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m09s

continuous number right and so then that
01:28:12.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m12s

whole thing we can then feed into you
01:28:14.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m14s

know and you're on it all right and then
01:28:18.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m18s

at the end remember a final
01:28:24.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m24s

non-linearity was a sigmoid right so we
01:28:28.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m28s

can now recognize that
01:28:30.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m30s

thing we did where we did sigmoid x max
01:28:32.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m32s

reading vote - min reading + blah blah
01:28:34.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m34s

blah is actually just another nonlinear
01:28:36.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m36s

activation function alright remember in
01:28:40.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m40s

our last layer we use generally
01:28:43.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m43s

different kinds of activation functions
01:28:46.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m46s

so as we said we don't need any
01:28:48.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m48s

activation function at all right we
01:28:51.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m51s

could just do that right but by not
01:28:52.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m52s

having any nonlinear activation function
01:28:59.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m59s

we're just making it harder so that's
01:29:01.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m01s

why we put the sigmoid in there as well
01:29:03.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m03s

okay so we can then fit it in the usual
01:29:06.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m06s

way and there we go
01:29:10.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m10s

you know interestingly we actually got a
01:29:14.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m14s

better score than we did with our this
01:29:15.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m15s

model so I'll be interesting to try
01:29:20.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m20s

training this with stochastic gradient
01:29:23.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m23s

descent with restarts and see if it's
01:29:24.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m24s

actually better you know maybe you can
01:29:26.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m26s

play around with the number of hidden
01:29:29.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m29s

layers and the drop out and whatever
01:29:30.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m30s

else and see if you can come up with you
01:29:32.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m32s

know get a better answer than point
01:29:35.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m35s

seven six ish okay so so general so this
01:29:44.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m44s

is like if you were going deep into
01:29:50.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m50s

collaborative filtering at your
01:29:53.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m53s

workplace
01:29:55.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m55s

whatever this wouldn't be a bad way to
01:29:55.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m55s

go I could like I'd start out with like
01:29:57.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m57s

oh okay here's like a flat footed
01:29:59.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m59s

dataset 30 in first day I get learner
01:30:01.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m01s

there's you know not much I can send it
01:30:04.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m04s

basically number of factors is about the
01:30:06.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m06s

only thing that I pass in I can learn
01:30:07.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m07s

for a while maybe try a few different
01:30:10.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m10s

approaches and then you're like okay
01:30:13.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m13s

there's like that's how I go if I use
01:30:15.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m15s

the defaults okay how do I make it
01:30:18.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m18s

better and then I'd be like dig into the
01:30:22.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m22s

code and seeing like okay well what if
01:30:23.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m23s

Jeremy actually do here this is actually
01:30:24.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m24s

what I want you know and so one of the
01:30:27.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m27s

nice things about the neural net
01:30:30.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m30s

approach is that you know as unit
01:30:32.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m32s

mentioned we can have different numbers
01:30:36.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m36s

of embeddings we can choose how many
01:30:38.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m38s

hidden and we can also choose
01:30:43.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m43s

drop now right so so what we're actually
01:30:45.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m45s

doing is we haven't just got real you
01:30:51.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m51s

that we're also going like okay let's
01:30:52.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m52s

let's delete a few things at random
01:31:00.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m00s

alright let's drop out so in this case
01:31:05.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m05s

we were deleting after the first linear
01:31:08.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m08s

layer 75% of them all right and then
01:31:12.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m12s

after the second one in like 75% of them
01:31:16.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m16s

so we can add a whole lot of
01:31:18.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m18s

regularization yes so you know this it
01:31:19.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m19s

kind of feels like the this this
01:31:22.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m22s

embedding net you know you could you
01:31:24.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m24s

could change this again we could like
01:31:28.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m28s

have it so that we can pass into the
01:31:29.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m29s

constructor well if you're gonna make it
01:31:31.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m31s

look as much as possible like what we
01:31:37.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m37s

had before we could surpass him peace
01:31:39.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m39s

peace equals 0.75 oh I'm not sure this
01:31:41.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m41s

is the best API but it's not terrible
01:31:48.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m48s

probably what since we've only got
01:31:51.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m51s

exactly two layers we could say p1
01:31:53.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m53s

equals 0.75 v p2 v and so then this will
01:31:55.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m55s

be P 1 this will be Peter you know where
01:32:08.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m08s

we go and like if you wanted to go
01:32:18.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m18s

further you could make it look more like
01:32:20.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m20s

our structured data learner you could
01:32:24.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m24s

actually have a thing this number of
01:32:29.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m29s

hidden you know maybe you could make a
01:32:31.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m31s

list and so then rather than creating
01:32:34.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m34s

exactly one hidden layer and one output
01:32:37.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m37s

layer this could be a little loop that
01:32:40.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m40s

creates and hidden miners each one of
01:32:42.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m42s

the size you want so like this is all
01:32:45.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m45s

stuff you can play with during the
01:32:47.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m47s

hearing the week if you want to and I
01:32:48.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m48s

feel like if you've got like a much
01:32:52.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m52s

smaller collaborative children data set
01:32:53.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m53s

you know maybe you need like more
01:32:55.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m55s

regularization or whatever
01:32:57.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m57s

it's a much bigger one maybe more layers
01:32:59.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m59s

would help I don't know you know III
01:33:02.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m02s

haven't seen much discussion of this
01:33:04.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m04s

kind of neural network approach to
01:33:08.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m08s

collaborative filtering but I'm not a
01:33:10.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m10s

collaborative filtering expert so maybe
01:33:12.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m12s

it's maybe it's around but that'd be
01:33:13.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m13s

interesting thing to try so the next
01:33:15.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m15s

thing I wanted to do was to talk about
01:33:22.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m22s

the training loop so what's actually
01:33:27.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m27s

happening inside the training loop so at
01:33:29.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m29s

the moment we're basically passing off
01:33:34.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m34s

the actual updating of the weights to PI
01:33:37.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m37s

torches optimizer but what I'm going to
01:33:42.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m42s

do is like understand what that
01:33:46.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m46s

optimizer is is actually good and we're
01:33:49.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m49s

also I also want to understand what this
01:33:52.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m52s

Momentum's him he's doing so you'll find
01:33:54.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m54s

we have a spreadsheet called grab disk
01:33:58.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m58s

gradient descent and it's kind of
01:34:03.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m03s

designed to be read left to right sorry
01:34:06.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m06s

right to left worksheet was so the
01:34:08.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m08s

rightmost worksheet is some data right
01:34:11.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m11s

and we're going to implement gradient
01:34:14.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m14s

descent in Excel because obviously
01:34:16.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m16s

everybody wants to do deep learning in
01:34:18.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m18s

it Selman we've done collaborative
01:34:20.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m20s

filtering in Excel we've done
01:34:22.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m22s

convolutions in Excel so now we need SJD
01:34:23.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m23s

in Excel so we can replace - once and
01:34:27.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m27s

for all
01:34:30.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m30s

okay so let's start by creating some
01:34:30.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m30s

data right and so here's you know here's
01:34:33.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m33s

some independent you know I've got one
01:34:37.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m37s

column of X's you know and one column of
01:34:40.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m40s

wise and these are actually directly
01:34:45.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m45s

linearly related so this is this is
01:34:48.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m48s

random right and this one here is equal
01:34:50.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m50s

to x times 2 plus 30 ok so let's try and
01:34:54.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m54s

use Excel to take that data and try and
01:35:03.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m03s

learn those parameters
01:35:09.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m09s

okay that's going to be able so let's
01:35:13.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m13s

start with the most basic version of SGD
01:35:18.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m18s

and so the first thing I'm going to do
01:35:21.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m21s

is I'm going to run a macro so you can
01:35:23.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m23s

see what this looks like so I'll hit run
01:35:25.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m25s

and it does five eight bucks under
01:35:27.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m27s

another five eight bucks
01:35:31.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m31s

- another five eight bucks okay so the
01:35:32.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m32s

first one was pretty terrible it's hard
01:35:36.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m36s

to see so I'll just delete that first
01:35:38.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m38s

one get better scaling alright so you
01:35:39.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m39s

can see it actually it's pretty
01:35:45.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m45s

constantly improving the loss all right
01:35:47.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m47s

this is the loss per pot all right so
01:35:50.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m50s

how do we do that so let's reset it so
01:35:53.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m53s

here is my X's and my y's and what I do
01:35:57.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m57s

is I start out by assuming some
01:36:03.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m03s

intercept and some slope right so this
01:36:06.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m06s

is my randomly initialized weights so I
01:36:10.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m10s

have randomly initialized them both to
01:36:13.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m13s

one you could pick a different random
01:36:15.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m15s

number if you like but I promise that I
01:36:18.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m18s

randomly picked the number one twice
01:36:21.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m21s

there you go
01:36:24.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m24s

it was a random number between one and
01:36:27.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m27s

one so here is my intercept and slope
01:36:30.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m30s

I'm just going to copy them over here
01:36:34.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m34s

right so you can literally see this is
01:36:36.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m36s

just equal see one here is equals c2
01:36:37.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m37s

okay so I'm gonna start with my very
01:36:41.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m41s

first row of data x equals 14 y equals
01:36:44.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m44s

58 and my goal is to come up after I
01:36:47.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m47s

look at this piece of data I want to
01:36:51.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m51s

come up with a slightly better intercept
01:36:53.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m53s

and a slightly better slope okay so to
01:36:54.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m54s

do that I need to first of all basically
01:36:59.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m59s

figure out which direction is is down in
01:37:02.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m02s

other words if I make my intercept a
01:37:08.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m08s

little bit higher or a little bit lower
01:37:10.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m10s

would it make my error a little bit
01:37:13.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m13s

better or a little bit worse so let's
01:37:15.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m15s

start out by calculating the error so to
01:37:17.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m17s

calculate the error the first thing we
01:37:20.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m20s

need is a prediction so the prediction
01:37:21.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m21s

is equal to the interest
01:37:24.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m24s

at plus x times so that is our zero
01:37:26.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m26s

hidden layer neural network okay
01:37:33.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m33s

and so here is our era it's equal to our
01:37:36.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m36s

prediction - our actual squared so we
01:37:40.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m40s

could like play around with this I don't
01:37:43.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m43s

want my error to be 18-49 I'd like it to
01:37:45.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m45s

be lower so what if we set the
01:37:47.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m47s

intercepts to one point one 18-49 goes
01:37:49.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m49s

to 1840 okay so a higher intercept would
01:37:54.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m54s

be better okay what about the slope to
01:37:57.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m57s

increase that it goes from 1849 to 1730
01:38:00.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m00s

okay a higher slope would be better as
01:38:05.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m05s

well not surprising because we know
01:38:07.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m07s

actually that there should be 30 into so
01:38:09.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m09s

one way to figure that out
01:38:14.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m14s

you know encode and this protein is to
01:38:18.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m18s

do literally what I just did is to add a
01:38:20.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m20s

little bit to the intercept and the
01:38:23.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m23s

slope and see what happens and that's
01:38:24.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m24s

called finding the derivative through
01:38:26.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m26s

finite differencing right and so let's
01:38:27.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m27s

go ahead and do that so here is the
01:38:30.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m30s

value of my error if I add 0.01 to my
01:38:34.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m34s

intercept all right so it's c4 plus 0.01
01:38:40.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m40s

and then I just put that into my Lydian
01:38:43.879
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m43s

function and then I subtract my actual
01:38:46.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m46s

all squared all right and so that causes
01:38:48.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m48s

my arrow to go down a bit
01:38:51.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m51s

that's our increasing my is that
01:38:53.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m53s

increasing will see for increasing the
01:38:59.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m59s

intercept a little bit has caused my
01:39:01.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m01s

arrow to go down so what's the
01:39:03.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m03s

derivative well the derivative is equal
01:39:05.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m05s

to how much the dependent variable
01:39:07.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m07s

changed by divided by how much the
01:39:09.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m09s

independent variable changed by all
01:39:11.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m11s

right and so there it is right our
01:39:13.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m13s

dependent variable changed by that -
01:39:16.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m16s

that right and our independent variable
01:39:18.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m18s

we changed by 0.01 so there is the
01:39:21.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m21s

estimated value of the error dB so
01:39:24.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m24s

remember when people talking about
01:39:29.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m29s

derivatives right this is this is all
01:39:30.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m30s

they're doing is they're saying what's
01:39:32.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m32s

this value but as we make this number
01:39:34.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m34s

smaller and smaller and smaller
01:39:37.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m37s

and smaller as it as limits to zero
01:39:39.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m39s

I'm not mad enough to think in terms of
01:39:43.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m43s

like derivatives and integrals and stuff
01:39:45.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m45s

like that so whatever I think about this
01:39:47.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m47s

I always think about you know an actual
01:39:49.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m49s

like plus 0.01 and divided by 0.01
01:39:51.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m51s

because like I just find that easier
01:39:54.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m54s

just like I'd ever think about
01:39:56.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m56s

probability density functions I always
01:39:58.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m58s

think about actual probabilities of that
01:40:00.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m00s

toss a coin
01:40:02.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m02s

something happens three times so I
01:40:03.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m03s

always think like remember it's it's
01:40:06.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m06s

totally fair to do this because a
01:40:08.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m08s

computer is discrete it's not continuous
01:40:10.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m10s

like a computer can't do anything
01:40:14.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m14s

infinitely small anyway right so it's
01:40:15.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m15s

actually got to be calculating things at
01:40:18.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m18s

some level of precision right and our
01:40:21.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m21s

brains kind of need that as well so this
01:40:23.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m23s

is like my version of Jeffery Clinton's
01:40:26.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m26s

like to visualize things in more than
01:40:29.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m29s

two dimensions you just like say 12
01:40:31.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m31s

dimensions really quickly well
01:40:33.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m33s

visualizing in two dimensions this is my
01:40:34.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m34s

equivalent you know to to think about
01:40:36.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m36s

derivatives just think about division
01:40:38.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m38s

and like although all the mathematicians
01:40:41.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m41s

say no you can't do that you actually
01:40:44.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m44s

can like if you think of DX dy is being
01:40:47.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m47s

literally you know change in X over
01:40:49.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m49s

changing Y like the division actually
01:40:51.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m51s

like the calculations do work like all
01:40:55.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m55s

the time so okay so let's do the same
01:40:58.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m58s

thing now with changing my slope by a
01:41:01.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m01s

little bit and so here's the same thing
01:41:05.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m05s

right and so you can see both of these
01:41:07.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m07s

are negative okay so that's saying if I
01:41:10.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m10s

increase my intercept my loss goes down
01:41:13.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m13s

if I increase my slope my loss goes down
01:41:16.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m16s

right and so my derivative of my error
01:41:20.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m20s

with respect to my slope is is actually
01:41:24.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m24s

pretty high and that's not surprising
01:41:29.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m29s

because it's actually you know the
01:41:31.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m31s

constant term is just being added where
01:41:36.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m36s

else as slope is being multiplied by 40
01:41:37.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m37s

okay now find that differencing is all
01:41:42.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m42s

very well and good but there's a big
01:41:48.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m48s

problem with finite difference seeing in
01:41:49.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m49s

Hyden
01:41:52.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m52s

no spaces and the problem is this right
01:41:53.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m53s

and this is like you don't need to learn
01:41:56.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m56s

how to calculate derivatives or
01:42:00.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m00s

integrals but you need to learn how to
01:42:02.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m02s

think about them spatially right and so
01:42:04.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m04s

remember we have some vector very high
01:42:06.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m06s

dimensional vector it's got like a
01:42:12.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m12s

million items in it right and it's going
01:42:13.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m13s

through some weight matrix right of size
01:42:18.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m18s

like 1 million by size a hundred
01:42:22.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m22s

thousand or whatever and it's spitting
01:42:24.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m24s

out something of size I hundred thousand
01:42:26.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m26s

and so you need to realize like there
01:42:28.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m28s

isn't like a gradient yeah but it's like
01:42:33.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m33s

for every one of these things in this
01:42:36.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m36s

vector right there's a gradient in every
01:42:38.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m38s

direction you know in every part of the
01:42:43.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m43s

output right so it actually has not a
01:42:45.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m45s

single gradient number not even a
01:42:50.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m50s

gradient vector but a gradient matrix
01:42:52.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m52s

right and so this this is a lot to
01:42:57.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m57s

calculate right I would literally have
01:43:03.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m03s

to like add a little bit to this and see
01:43:04.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m04s

what happens to all of these add a
01:43:07.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m07s

little bit to this see what happens to
01:43:09.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m09s

all of these right to fill in one column
01:43:11.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m11s

of this at a time so that's going to be
01:43:14.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m14s

horrendously slow like that so that's
01:43:18.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m18s

why like if you're ever thinking like
01:43:21.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m21s

how we can just do this with finite
01:43:23.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m23s

differencing just remember like okay we
01:43:24.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m24s

we're dealing in the with these very
01:43:26.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m26s

high dimensional vectors where you know
01:43:28.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m28s

this this kind of matrix calculus like
01:43:32.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m32s

all the concepts are identical but when
01:43:37.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m37s

you actually draw it out like this you
01:43:40.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m40s

suddenly realize like okay for each
01:43:42.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m42s

number I could change there's a whole
01:43:44.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m44s

bunch of numbers that impacts and I have
01:43:47.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m47s

this whole matrix of things to compute
01:43:49.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m49s

right and so your gradient calculations
01:43:50.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m50s

can take up a lot of memory and they can
01:43:54.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m54s

take up a lot of time so we want to find
01:43:56.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m56s

some way to do this more quickly okay
01:43:59.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m59s

and it's definitely well worth like
01:44:05.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m05s

spending time kind of studying these
01:44:07.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m07s

ideas of like you know the idea of like
01:44:10.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m10s

the gradients like look up things like
01:44:14.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m14s

Jacobian and Hessian they're the things
01:44:16.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m16s

that you want to search for just that
01:44:24.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m24s

unfortunately people normally write
01:44:27.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m27s

about them with you know lots of great
01:44:29.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m29s

letters and bla bla bla right but there
01:44:32.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m32s

are some there are some nice you know
01:44:35.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m35s

intuitive explanations out there and
01:44:39.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m39s

hopefully you can share them on the
01:44:41.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m41s

forum if you find them because this is
01:44:43.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m43s

stuff you really need to really need to
01:44:44.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m44s

understand in here you know because
01:44:47.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m47s

you're trying to train something and
01:44:51.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m51s

it's not working properly and like later
01:44:54.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m54s

on we'll learn how to like look inside
01:44:56.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m56s

hi torch to like actually get the values
01:44:58.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m58s

of the gradients and you need to know
01:45:00.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m00s

like okay well how would I like what the
01:45:02.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m02s

gradients you know what would I consider
01:45:04.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m04s

unusual like you know these are the
01:45:06.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m06s

things that turn you into a really
01:45:08.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m08s

awesome deep learning practitioner is
01:45:10.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m10s

when you can like debug your problems by
01:45:13.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m13s

like grabbing the gradients and doing
01:45:15.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m15s

histograms of them and like knowing you
01:45:17.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m17s

know that you could like plot that all
01:45:19.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m19s

each layer my average gradients getting
01:45:21.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m21s

worse or you know bigger okay so the
01:45:23.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m23s

trick to doing this more quickly is to
01:45:28.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m28s

do it analytically rather than through
01:45:30.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m30s

finite differencing and so analytically
01:45:34.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m34s

is basically there is a list you
01:45:37.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m37s

probably all learned it at high school
01:45:40.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m40s

there is a literally a list of rules
01:45:41.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m41s

that for every mathematical function
01:45:42.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m42s

there's a like this is the derivative of
01:45:46.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m46s

that function so you probably remember a
01:45:48.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m48s

few of them for example x squared - it's
01:45:53.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m53s

alright and so we actually have here an
01:46:00.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m00s

x squared so here is our two x right now
01:46:02.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m02s

the one that I actually want you to know
01:46:07.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m07s

is not any of the individual rules but I
01:46:10.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m10s

want you to know the chain rule right
01:46:15.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m15s

which
01:46:17.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m17s

you've got some function of some
01:46:19.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m19s

function of something why is this
01:46:22.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m22s

important
01:46:25.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m25s

I don't know that's a linear layer
01:46:26.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m26s

that's a rally right and then we can
01:46:28.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m28s

kind of keep going backwards map etc
01:46:33.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m33s

right a neural net is just a function of
01:46:37.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m37s

a function of a function of a function
01:46:42.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m42s

where the innermost is you know it's
01:46:43.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m43s

basically linear rally your linear rally
01:46:45.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m45s

your dot linear sigmoid or soft mass all
01:46:49.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m49s

right and so it's a function of a
01:47:00.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m00s

function of a function and so therefore
01:47:02.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m02s

to calculate the derivative of the
01:47:03.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m03s

weights in your model the loss of your
01:47:06.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m06s

model with respect to the weights of
01:47:10.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m10s

your model you're going to need to use
01:47:12.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m12s

the chain rule and specifically whatever
01:47:13.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m13s

layer it is that you're up to like I
01:47:15.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m15s

want to calculate the derivative here
01:47:17.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m17s

and got a need to use all of these all
01:47:19.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m19s

of these ones because that's all that's
01:47:23.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m23s

that's the function that's being applied
01:47:24.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m24s

right and that's why they call this back
01:47:25.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m25s

propagation because the value of the
01:47:28.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m28s

derivative of that is equal to that
01:47:30.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m30s

derivative now basically you can do it
01:47:36.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m36s

like this you can say let's call you is
01:47:39.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m39s

this right
01:47:43.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m43s

let's call that you all right then it's
01:47:44.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m44s

simply equal to the derivative of that
01:47:47.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m47s

times derivative of that right
01:47:51.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m51s

you just multiply them together and so
01:47:56.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m56s

that's what back propagation is like
01:47:59.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m59s

it's not that back propagation is a new
01:48:00.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m00s

thing for you to learn it's not a new
01:48:03.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m03s

algorithm it is literally take the
01:48:06.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m06s

derivative of every one of your layers
01:48:10.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m10s

and multiply them all together so like
01:48:12.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m12s

it doesn't deserve a new name right
01:48:16.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m16s

apply the chain rule to my layers does
01:48:18.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m18s

not deserve a new name but it gets one
01:48:23.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m23s

because us neural networks folk really
01:48:24.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m24s

need to seem as clever as possible it's
01:48:27.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m27s

really important that everybody else
01:48:29.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m29s

thinks
01:48:31.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m31s

we are way outside of their capabilities
01:48:32.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m32s

so the fact that you're here means that
01:48:34.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m34s

we've failed because you guys somehow
01:48:37.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m37s

think that you're capable right so
01:48:39.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m39s

remember it's really important when you
01:48:41.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m41s

talk to other people that you say
01:48:43.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m43s

backpropagation and rectified linear
01:48:45.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m45s

unit rather than like multiply the
01:48:48.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m48s

layers gradients or replace negatives
01:48:51.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m51s

with zeros okay so so here we go
01:48:54.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m54s

so here is so I've just gone ahead and
01:48:57.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m57s

grabbed the derivative unfortunately
01:49:00.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m00s

there is no automatic differentiation in
01:49:03.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m03s

Excel yet so I did the alternative which
01:49:05.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m05s

is to paste the formula into Wolfram
01:49:07.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m07s

Alpha and got back the derivative so
01:49:09.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m09s

there's the first derivative and there's
01:49:12.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m12s

the second derivative analytically we
01:49:14.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m14s

only have one layer in this infinite
01:49:16.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m16s

finally small neural network so we don't
01:49:19.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m19s

have to worry about the chain rule and
01:49:21.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m21s

we should see that this analytical
01:49:23.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m23s

derivative is pretty close to our
01:49:25.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m25s

estimated derivative from the find out
01:49:27.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m27s

differencing and indeed it is right and
01:49:28.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m28s

we should see that these ones are pretty
01:49:31.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m31s

similar as well and indeed they are
01:49:33.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m33s

right and if you're you know back when I
01:49:35.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m35s

implemented my own neural Nets 20 years
01:49:38.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m38s

ago I you know had to actually calculate
01:49:41.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m41s

the derivatives and so I always would
01:49:45.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m45s

write like had something that would
01:49:46.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m46s

check the derivatives using finite
01:49:48.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m48s

difference in and so for those poor
01:49:50.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m50s

people that they'd have to write these
01:49:52.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m52s

things by hand you'll still see that
01:49:53.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m53s

they have like a finite differencing
01:49:55.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m55s

checkout so if you ever do have to
01:49:57.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m57s

implement a derivative by hand please
01:49:59.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m59s

make sure that you have a finite
01:50:02.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m02s

differencing checker so that you can
01:50:05.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m05s

test it alright so there's no
01:50:07.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m07s

derivatives so we know that if we
01:50:10.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m10s

increase B then we're going to get a
01:50:13.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m13s

slightly better loss so let's increase B
01:50:17.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m17s

by a bit how much should we increase it
01:50:19.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m19s

by well we'll increase it by some more
01:50:22.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m22s

for this so the motor-pod we're going to
01:50:24.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m24s

choose is called a learning rate and so
01:50:26.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m26s

here's our learning rate so here's one
01:50:28.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m28s

enoch 4 ok so our new value is equal to
01:50:29.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m29s

whatever it was before
01:50:37.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m37s

- our derivative times our learning rate
01:50:39.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m39s

okay so we've gone from one to one point
01:50:45.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m45s

or one and then a we've done the same
01:50:47.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m47s

thing so it's gone from one to one point
01:50:52.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m52s

one two so this is a special kind of
01:50:56.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m56s

mini batch it's a mini batch of size one
01:51:00.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m00s

okay so we call this online grading does
01:51:02.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m02s

it just means mini batch of size one so
01:51:04.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m04s

then we can go into the next one next is
01:51:09.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m09s

86
01:51:11.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m11s

why is 202 right this is my intercept
01:51:11.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m11s

and slope copied across from the last
01:51:15.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m15s

row okay so here's my new wire
01:51:17.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m17s

prediction here's my new era here are my
01:51:22.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m22s

derivatives here are my new a and B okay
01:51:26.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m26s

so we keep doing that for every mini
01:51:29.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m29s

batch of one until eventually we run out
01:51:32.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m32s

at the end of the new pocket okay and so
01:51:37.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m37s

then at the end of an epoch we would
01:51:41.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m41s

grab our intercept and slope and paste
01:51:43.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m43s

them back over here as our new values
01:51:48.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m48s

there we are and we can now continue
01:51:53.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m53s

again all right so we're now starting
01:51:56.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m56s

with pops today's either in the wrong
01:51:59.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m59s

spot it should be pasted special
01:52:02.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m02s

transpose values all right okay
01:52:06.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m06s

so there's a new intercept there's any
01:52:10.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m10s

slope possibly I got that the wrong way
01:52:12.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m12s

around but anyway you get the idea and
01:52:13.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m13s

then we continue okay so I recorded the
01:52:15.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m15s

world's tiniest macro which literally
01:52:19.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m19s

just copies the final slope and puts it
01:52:22.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m22s

into the new slope copies the final
01:52:29.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m29s

intercept put the new intercept and does
01:52:32.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m32s

that five times and after each time it
01:52:36.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m36s

grabs the root mean squared error and
01:52:40.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m40s

pastes it into the next spare area and
01:52:42.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m42s

that is attached to this Run button and
01:52:45.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m45s

so that's going to go ahead and do that
01:52:48.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m48s

five times okay so that's stochastic
01:52:49.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m49s

gradient descent and if so so to turn
01:52:53.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m53s

this into a CNN
01:52:57.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m57s

all right you would just replace this
01:52:58.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m58s

error function right and therefore this
01:53:02.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m02s

prediction with the output of that
01:53:05.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m05s

convolutional example spreadsheet okay
01:53:08.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m08s

and that then would be in CNN being
01:53:12.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m12s

trained with with SGD okay
01:53:15.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m15s

now the problem is that you'll see when
01:53:19.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m19s

I run this it's kind of going very
01:53:24.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m24s

slowly right we know that we need to get
01:53:30.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m30s

to a slope of two and an intercept of
01:53:32.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m32s

thirty and you can kind of see it this
01:53:35.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m35s

rate it's going to take a very long time
01:53:37.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m37s

right and specifically it's like it
01:53:40.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m40s

keeps going the same direction so it's
01:53:49.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m49s

like come on take a hint that's a good
01:53:51.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m51s

direction so they come on take a hint
01:53:53.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m53s

that's a good direction please keep
01:53:56.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m56s

doing that but more is called momentum
01:53:58.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m58s

right so on our next spreadsheet we're
01:54:01.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m01s

going to implement momentum okay so what
01:54:05.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m05s

momentum does is the same thing and what
01:54:11.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m11s

to simplify this spreadsheet I've
01:54:14.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m14s

removed the finite difference cause okay
01:54:16.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m16s

other than that this is just the same
01:54:19.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m19s

right so it's true what our X is our
01:54:21.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m21s

wise A's and B's predictions our error
01:54:22.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m22s

is now over here okay and here's our
01:54:28.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m28s

derivatives okay our new calculation for
01:54:32.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m32s

this particular row our new calculation
01:54:39.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m39s

here for our new a term just like before
01:54:45.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m45s

is is equal to whatever a was before -
01:54:49.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m49s

okay now this time I'm not taking the
01:54:56.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m56s

derivative but I'm - income other number
01:54:59.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m59s

times the loan rate so what's this other
01:55:01.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m01s

number okay so this other number is
01:55:03.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m03s

equal to the derivative
01:55:08.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m08s

times what's this k 1.02 plus 0.98 times
01:55:13.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m13s

the thing just above it okay so this is
01:55:22.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m22s

a linear interpolation between this rows
01:55:26.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m26s

derivative for this mini-batches
01:55:31.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m31s

derivative and whatever direction we
01:55:32.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m32s

went last time right so in other words
01:55:35.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m35s

keep going the same direction as you
01:55:39.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m39s

were before right then update it a
01:55:41.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m41s

little bit right and so in our rich in
01:55:44.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m44s

our Python just before we had a momentum
01:55:48.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m48s

of 0.9 okay so you can see what tends to
01:55:51.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m51s

happen is that our negative kind of gets
01:55:55.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m55s

more and more negative right all the way
01:56:01.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m01s

up to like 2,000 where else with our
01:56:03.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m03s

standard SGD approach a derivatives are
01:56:08.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m08s

kind of all over the place right
01:56:11.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m11s

sometimes there's 700 something negative
01:56:14.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m14s

7 positive 100 you know so this is
01:56:16.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m16s

basically saying like yeah if you've
01:56:18.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m18s

been going down for quite a while keep
01:56:21.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m21s

doing that until finally here it's like
01:56:24.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m24s

okay that's that seems to be far enough
01:56:26.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m26s

so that's being less and less and less
01:56:28.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m28s

negative all right mister we start being
01:56:29.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m29s

positive again so you can kind of see
01:56:32.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m32s

why it's called momentum it's like once
01:56:34.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m34s

you start traveling in a particular
01:56:35.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m35s

direction for a particular weight you're
01:56:37.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m37s

kind of the wheel start spinning and
01:56:40.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m40s

then once the gradient turns around the
01:56:41.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m41s

other way it's like Oh slow down we've
01:56:44.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m44s

got this kind of event um and then
01:56:46.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m46s

finally turn back around right so when
01:56:48.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m48s

we do it this way all right we can do
01:56:51.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m51s

exactly the same thing right and after
01:56:57.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m57s

five iterations we're at 89 where else
01:56:59.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m59s

before after five iterations we're at
01:57:04.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m04s

104 right and after a few more let's go
01:57:07.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m07s

maybe 15 okay so get this 102 for us
01:57:11.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m11s

here
01:57:20.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m20s

it's going right so it's it's it's a bit
01:57:26.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m26s

better it's not hips better you can
01:57:30.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m30s

still see like these numbers they're not
01:57:31.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m31s

zipping along right but it's definitely
01:57:35.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m35s

an improvement and it also gives us
01:57:38.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m38s

something else to tune which is nice
01:57:40.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m40s

like so if this is kind of a
01:57:41.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m41s

well-behaved error surface right in
01:57:43.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m43s

other words like although it might be
01:57:45.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m45s

bumpy along the way there's kind of some
01:57:48.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m48s

overall direction like imagine you're
01:57:50.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m50s

going down a hill right and there's like
01:57:53.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m53s

bumps oh alright so the mobile more
01:57:55.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m55s

momentum you got going to skipping over
01:57:57.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m57s

the tops right so we could say like okay
01:57:59.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m59s

let's increase our beater up to 0.98
01:58:01.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m01s

right and see if that like allows us to
01:58:03.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m03s

train a little faster and whoa look at
01:58:06.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m06s

that suddenly what's going to okay so
01:58:08.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m08s

one nice thing about things like
01:58:10.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m10s

momentum is it's like another parameter
01:58:12.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m12s

that you can choose to try and make your
01:58:13.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m13s

model train better in practice basically
01:58:16.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m16s

everybody does this every like you look
01:58:21.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m21s

at any like image net winner or whatever
01:58:24.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m24s

they all use momentum okay and so back
01:58:26.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m26s

over here when we said here's SGD that
01:58:37.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m37s

basically means use the basic tab of our
01:58:41.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m41s

Excel spreadsheet but then momentum
01:58:44.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m44s

equals 0.9 means add in put a point nine
01:58:46.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m46s

over here okay and so that that's kind
01:58:52.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m52s

of your like default starting point so
01:58:58.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m58s

let's keep going and talk about Adam so
01:59:03.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m03s

Adam is something which I actually was
01:59:12.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m12s

not right earlier on in this course I
01:59:18.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m18s

said we've been using Adam by default we
01:59:20.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m20s

actually haven't we've actually been I
01:59:22.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m22s

noticed our we've actually been using
01:59:24.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m24s

SGD with momentum by default and the
01:59:25.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m25s

reason is that Adam has had
01:59:29.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m29s

much faster as you'll see it's much much
01:59:34.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m34s

faster to learn with but there's been
01:59:36.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m36s

some problems which is people who
01:59:38.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m38s

haven't been getting quite as good like
01:59:39.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m39s

final answers with Adam as they have
01:59:41.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m41s

with std with momentum and that's why
01:59:44.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m44s

you'll see like all the you know image
01:59:46.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m46s

net winning solutions and so forth and
01:59:48.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m48s

all the academic papers always use SGD
01:59:50.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m50s

with momentum and I'll Adam seems to be
01:59:54.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m54s

a particular problem in NLP people
01:59:56.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m56s

really haven't got Adam working at all
01:59:58.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m58s

well the good news is this was I built
02:00:00.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m00s

it looks like this was solved two weeks
02:00:06.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m06s

ago it basically it turned out that the
02:00:08.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m08s

way people were dealing with a
02:00:13.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m13s

combination of weight decay in Adam had
02:00:14.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m14s

a nasty kind of bargainer basically and
02:00:17.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m17s

that's that's kind of carried through to
02:00:20.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m20s

every single library and one of our
02:00:22.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m22s

students and then Sahara has actually
02:00:24.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m24s

just completed a prototype of adding is
02:00:27.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m27s

this new version of Adam has called Adam
02:00:31.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m31s

W into fast AI and he's confirmed that
02:00:33.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m33s

he's getting much faster both the faster
02:00:36.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m36s

performance and also the better accuracy
02:00:40.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m40s

so hopefully we'll have this Adam W in
02:00:43.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m43s

faster ideally before next week we'll
02:00:47.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m47s

see how we go very very soon
02:00:49.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m49s

so so it is worth telling you about
02:00:51.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m51s

about Adam so let's talk about it it's
02:00:53.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m53s

actually incredibly simple but again you
02:00:58.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m58s

know make sure you make it sound really
02:01:02.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m02s

complicated when you tell people so that
02:01:04.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m04s

you can so here's the same spreadsheet
02:01:06.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m06s

again right and here's our randomly
02:01:09.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m09s

selected a and B again somehow it's
02:01:13.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m13s

still one here's a prediction here's our
02:01:16.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m16s

derivatives okay so now how we count
02:01:19.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m19s

letting on you hey you could immediately
02:01:21.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m21s

see it's looking pretty hopeful because
02:01:25.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m25s

even by like row ten we're like we're
02:01:28.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m28s

seeing the numbers move a lot more right
02:01:31.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m31s

so this is looking pretty encouraging so
02:01:34.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m34s

how are we calculating this it's equal
02:01:38.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m38s

to our previous value with B minus j h
02:01:42.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m42s

we're gonna have to find out what that
02:01:48.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m48s

is times our learning rate divided by
02:01:49.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m49s

the square root of LH okay so I'm gonna
02:01:56.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m56s

have to dig it and see what's going on
02:01:59.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m59s

one thing to notice here is that my
02:02:00.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m00s

learning rate is way higher than it used
02:02:02.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m02s

to be but then we're dividing it by this
02:02:05.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m05s

big number okay so let's start out by
02:02:08.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m08s

looking and seeing what this day-out
02:02:12.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m12s

thing is okay
02:02:14.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m14s

j8 is identical to what we had before j8
02:02:19.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m19s

is equal to the linear interpolation of
02:02:23.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m23s

the derivative and the previous
02:02:25.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m25s

direction okay so that was easy so one
02:02:28.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m28s

part of atom is to use momentum in the
02:02:33.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m33s

way we just defined it
02:02:36.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m36s

okay the second piece was to divide by
02:02:39.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m39s

square root L 8 what is that square root
02:02:41.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m41s

L 8 okay is another linear interpolation
02:02:45.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m45s

of something and something else and
02:02:48.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m48s

specifically it's a linear interpolation
02:02:52.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m52s

of F 8 squared okay it's a linear
02:02:54.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m54s

interpolation of the derivative squared
02:03:00.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m00s

along with the derivative squared last
02:03:03.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m03s

time okay so in other words we've got
02:03:07.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m07s

two pieces of momentum going on here
02:03:09.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m09s

one is calculating the momentum version
02:03:13.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m13s

of the gradient the other is calculating
02:03:19.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m19s

the momentum version of the gradient
02:03:22.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m22s

squared and we often refer to this idea
02:03:24.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m24s

as a exponentially weighted moving
02:03:28.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m28s

average in other words it's basically
02:03:31.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m31s

equal to the average of this one and the
02:03:34.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m34s

last one in the last one in the last one
02:03:36.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m36s

that we're like multiplicatively
02:03:37.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m37s

decreasing the previous ones right
02:03:39.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m39s

because we're multiplying it by 0.9
02:03:42.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m42s

times what 999 and so you actually see
02:03:44.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m44s

that for instance in the faster I code
02:03:47.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m47s

if you look at fish we don't just
02:04:00.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m00s

calculate the average loss right because
02:04:04.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m04s

what I actually want we certainly don't
02:04:10.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m10s

just report the loss for every mini
02:04:13.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m13s

match because that just bounces around
02:04:14.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m14s

so much so instead I say average loss is
02:04:16.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m16s

equal to whatever the average loss was
02:04:20.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m20s

last time times 0.98 plus the loss this
02:04:22.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m22s

time times 0.02 right so in other words
02:04:27.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m27s

the faster you library the thing that
02:04:31.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m31s

it's actually when you do like the
02:04:34.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m34s

learning rate finder or plot loss it's
02:04:36.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m36s

actually showing you the exponentially
02:04:38.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m38s

weighted moving average of the loss okay
02:04:40.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m40s

so it's like a really handy concept it
02:04:44.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m44s

appears quite a lot right the other in
02:04:47.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m47s

handy concept know about is this idea of
02:04:49.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m49s

like you've got two numbers one of them
02:04:52.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m52s

is multiplied by some value the other is
02:04:55.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m55s

multiplied by one minus that value so
02:04:58.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m58s

this is a linear interpolation of two
02:05:00.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m00s

values you'll see it all the time and
02:05:02.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m02s

for some reason deep learning people
02:05:05.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m05s

nearly always use the value alpha when
02:05:09.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m09s

they do this so like keep an eye out if
02:05:11.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m11s

you're reading a paper or something and
02:05:13.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m13s

you see like alpha times bla bla bla bla
02:05:15.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m15s

bla plus one minus alpha times some
02:05:17.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m17s

other bla bla bla bla right immediately
02:05:22.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m22s

like when people read papers none of us
02:05:25.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m25s

like read every thing in the equation we
02:05:28.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m28s

look at it we go oh linear interpolation
02:05:31.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m31s

right and I said something I was just
02:05:33.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m33s

talking to Rachel about yesterday is
02:05:35.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m35s

like whether we could start trying to
02:05:37.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m37s

find like a a new way of writing papers
02:05:39.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m39s

where we literally refactor them right
02:05:42.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m42s

like it'd be so much better to have
02:05:44.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m44s

written like linear interpolate bla bla
02:05:45.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m45s

bla bla bla right because then you don't
02:05:50.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m50s

have to have that pattern recognition
02:05:52.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m52s

right but until we convince the world to
02:05:55.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m55s

change how they write papers this is
02:05:57.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m57s

what you have to do is you have to look
02:05:59.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m59s

you know know what to look for right and
02:06:00.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m00s

once you do suddenly the huge page with
02:06:03.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m03s

formulas
02:06:06.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m06s

that at all like you often notice like
02:06:09.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m09s

for example the two things in here like
02:06:11.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m11s

they might be totally identical but this
02:06:13.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m13s

might be a time T and this might be at
02:06:15.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m15s

like time t minus y or something right
02:06:17.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m17s

like it's very often these big ugly
02:06:19.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m19s

formulas turn out to be really really
02:06:21.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m21s

simple if only they had ripped out them
02:06:24.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m24s

okay so what are we doing with this
02:06:26.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m26s

gradient squared so what we were doing
02:06:30.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m30s

with the gradient squared is we were
02:06:34.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m34s

taking the square root and then we were
02:06:37.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m37s

adjusting the learning rate by dividing
02:06:40.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m40s

the learning rate by that okay so
02:06:42.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m42s

gradient squared is always positive
02:06:45.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m45s

right and we're taking the exponentially
02:06:49.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m49s

waiting move moving average of a bunch
02:06:53.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m53s

of things that are always positive and
02:06:55.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m55s

then we're taking the square root of
02:06:57.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m57s

that right so when is this number going
02:06:58.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m58s

to be high it's going to be particularly
02:07:01.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m01s

high if there's like one big you know if
02:07:04.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m04s

the gradients got a lot of variation
02:07:07.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m07s

that's oh there's a high variance of
02:07:09.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m09s

gradient then this G squared thing is
02:07:11.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m11s

going to be a really high number for us
02:07:14.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m14s

if it's like a constant amount right
02:07:16.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m16s

it's going to be smaller that cuz when
02:07:20.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m20s

you add things that are squared the
02:07:22.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m22s

squared slight jump out much bigger for
02:07:24.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m24s

us if there wasn't if there wasn't much
02:07:26.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m26s

change it's not going to be as big so
02:07:28.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m28s

basically this number at the bottom here
02:07:31.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m31s

is going to be high if our Brady --nt is
02:07:34.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m34s

changing a lot now what do you want to
02:07:38.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m38s

do if you've got something which is like
02:07:41.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m41s

first negative and then positive and
02:07:44.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m44s

then small and then high right well you
02:07:46.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m46s

probably want to be more careful right
02:07:50.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m50s

you probably don't want to take a big
02:07:53.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m53s

step because you can't really trust it
02:07:54.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m54s

right so when the when the variance of
02:07:56.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m56s

the gradient is high we're going to
02:07:59.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m59s

divide our learning rate by a big number
02:08:01.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m01s

we also found learning rate is very
02:08:03.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m03s

similar kind of size all the time then
02:08:06.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m06s

we probably feel pretty good about the
02:08:09.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m09s

step so we're dividing it by a small
02:08:11.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m11s

amount yeah and so this is called an
02:08:13.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m13s

adaptive learning rate yeah and like a
02:08:15.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m15s

lot of people have this confusion about
02:08:18.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m18s

atom I've seen it on the forum actually
02:08:19.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m19s

like there's some kind of adaptive
02:08:22.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m22s

learning rate where somehow you like
02:08:24.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m24s

setting different learning rates for
02:08:26.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m26s

different layers or something it's like
02:08:29.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m29s

no not really
02:08:31.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m31s

right all we're doing is we're just
02:08:33.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m33s

saying like this keep track of the
02:08:35.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m35s

average of the squares of the gradients
02:08:37.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m37s

and use that to adjust the learning rate
02:08:39.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m39s

so there's still one learning rate okay
02:08:43.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m43s

in this case it's one okay but
02:08:45.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m45s

effectively every parameter at every
02:08:48.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m48s

epoch is being kind of like getting a
02:08:51.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m51s

bigger jump if the learning rate if the
02:08:55.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m55s

gradients been pretty constant for that
02:08:57.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m57s

wait and a smaller jump otherwise okay
02:08:58.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m58s

and that's Adam that's the entirety of
02:09:02.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m02s

Adam in in Excel right so there's now no
02:09:04.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m04s

reason at all why you can't train
02:09:07.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m07s

imagenet in Excel because you've got
02:09:09.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m09s

you've got access to all of the pieces
02:09:11.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m11s

you need and so let's try this out run
02:09:13.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m13s

okay that's not bad right five and we
02:09:19.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m19s

straight up to twenty nine and two right
02:09:22.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m22s

so the difference between like you know
02:09:25.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m25s

standard SGD and this is is huge and
02:09:28.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m28s

basically that you know the key
02:09:31.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m31s

difference was that it figured out that
02:09:32.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m32s

we need to be you know moving this
02:09:35.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m35s

number much faster okay and so and so it
02:09:37.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m37s

do and so you can see we've now got like
02:09:42.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m42s

two different parameters one is kind of
02:09:45.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m45s

momentum for the gradient piece the
02:09:48.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m48s

other is the momentum for the gradient
02:09:50.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m50s

squared piece and there I think they're
02:09:52.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m52s

called like I think there's just a
02:09:56.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m56s

couple of the beta I think when you when
02:09:58.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m58s

you want to change it in PI tortes is I
02:10:00.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m00s

think what beta which is just a couple
02:10:02.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m02s

of two numbers you can change Jeremy so
02:10:03.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m03s

so you set the yeah I think I understand
02:10:11.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m11s

this concept of you know one day when a
02:10:15.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m15s

gradient is it goes up and down then
02:10:18.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m18s

you're not really sure which direction
02:10:21.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m21s

should should go so you should kind of
02:10:24.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m24s

slow things down
02:10:26.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m26s

therefore you subtract that gradient
02:10:27.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m27s

from the learning rate so but how do you
02:10:29.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m29s

implement how far do you go I guess
02:10:32.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m32s

maybe I miss something
02:10:35.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m35s

early on you do you set a number
02:10:36.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m36s

somewhere we divide yeah we divide the
02:10:38.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m38s

learning rate divided by the square root
02:10:42.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m42s

of the moving average gradient squared
02:10:45.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m45s

so that's where we use it
02:10:48.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m48s

oh I'm sorry can you be a little more
02:10:50.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m50s

sure so d2 is the learning rate which is
02:10:55.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m55s

one yeah m27
02:10:57.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m57s

is our moving average of the squared
02:11:00.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m00s

gradients so we just go D 2 divided by
02:11:02.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m02s

square root and preserve that's it okay
02:11:06.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m06s

thanks I have one question yeah
02:11:12.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m12s

so the new method that you just
02:11:16.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m16s

mentioned which is in the process of
02:11:19.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m19s

getting implemented in yes how different
02:11:21.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m21s

is it from here okay let's do that so to
02:11:27.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m27s

understand Adam W we have to understand
02:11:32.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m32s

wait okay and maybe we'll learn more
02:11:34.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m34s

about that later let's see how we go now
02:11:38.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m38s

with great okay
02:11:39.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m39s

so the idea is that when you have lots
02:11:40.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m40s

and lots of parameters like we do with
02:11:46.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m46s

you know most of the neural Nets we
02:11:48.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m48s

train you very often have like more
02:11:50.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m50s

parameters and data points or you know
02:11:54.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m54s

like regularization becomes important
02:11:56.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m56s

and we've learnt how to avoid
02:11:57.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m57s

overfitting by using dropout right which
02:12:00.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m00s

randomly deletes some activations in the
02:12:03.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m03s

hope that's going to learn some kind of
02:12:07.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m07s

more resilient set of weights there's
02:12:08.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m08s

another kind of Ritter ization we can
02:12:12.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m12s

use called weight decay or l2
02:12:14.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m14s

regularization and it's actually comes
02:12:16.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m16s

kind of as a kind of classic statistical
02:12:19.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m19s

technique and the idea is that we take
02:12:21.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m21s

our loss function right so we take out
02:12:23.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m23s

like arrow squared loss function and we
02:12:26.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m26s

add an additional piece to it let's add
02:12:29.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m29s

weight decay right now the additional
02:12:32.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m32s

piece we add is to basically add the
02:12:35.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m35s

square of the weights so we'd say plus B
02:12:39.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m39s

squared plus a squared
02:12:44.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m44s

okay that is now wait 2 K or L tree
02:12:49.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m49s

regularization and so the idea is that
02:12:55.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m55s

now the the loss function wants to keep
02:12:58.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m58s

the weight small because increasing the
02:13:04.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m04s

weights makes the loss worse and so it's
02:13:07.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m07s

only going to increase the weights if
02:13:10.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m10s

the loss improves by more than the
02:13:12.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m12s

amount of that penalty and in fact to
02:13:15.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m15s

make this weight to get to proper weight
02:13:17.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m17s

decay
02:13:19.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m19s

we then need some multiplier yeah right
02:13:20.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m20s

so if you remember back in our here we
02:13:24.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m24s

said weight decay equals W d5e neg 4
02:13:27.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m27s

okay so to actually use the same way to
02:13:31.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m31s

K I would have to multiply by 0.005 all
02:13:33.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m33s

right so that's actually now the same
02:13:39.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m39s

weight okay so if you have a really high
02:13:41.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m41s

weight decay that it's going to set all
02:13:47.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m47s

the parameters to zero so it'll never
02:13:49.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m49s

over fit right because it can't set any
02:13:52.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m52s

parameter to anything and so as you
02:13:55.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m55s

gradually decrease the weight decay a
02:13:57.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m57s

few more weights can actually be used
02:13:59.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m59s

right but the ones that don't help much
02:14:02.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m02s

it's still going to leave at zero or
02:14:05.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m05s

close to zero right so that's what
02:14:07.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m07s

that's what weight decay is is is
02:14:11.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m11s

literally to change the loss function to
02:14:14.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m14s

a D in this sum of squares of weights
02:14:16.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m16s

times some parameter some hyper
02:14:21.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m21s

parameter I should say the problem is
02:14:25.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m25s

that if you put that into the loss
02:14:28.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m28s

function as I have here then it ends up
02:14:31.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m31s

in the moving average of gradients and
02:14:35.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m35s

the moving average of Squared's of
02:14:38.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m38s

gradients for atom right and so
02:14:39.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m39s

basically we end up when there's a lot
02:14:42.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m42s

of variation we end up decreasing the
02:14:46.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m46s

amount of weight decay and if there's
02:14:52.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m52s

very little variation we end up
02:14:53.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m53s

increasing the amount of weight decay so
02:14:55.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m55s

we end up basically saying penalize
02:14:56.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m56s

parameters you know weights that are
02:15:00.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m00s

really
02:15:02.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m02s

hi unless their gradient varies a lot
02:15:03.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m03s

which is never what we intended right
02:15:06.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m06s

that's just not not the plan at all so
02:15:09.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m09s

the trick with Adam W is we basically
02:15:12.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m12s

remove weight decay from here so it's
02:15:15.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m15s

not in the last function it's not in the
02:15:19.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m19s

G not in the G squared and we move it so
02:15:22.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m22s

that instead it's it's it's added
02:15:25.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m25s

directly to the when we update with the
02:15:28.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m28s

learning rate
02:15:31.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m31s

it's out of there instead so in other
02:15:32.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m32s

words it would be we would put the
02:15:34.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m34s

weight decay or I should a gradient of
02:15:36.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m36s

the weight decay in here when we
02:15:38.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m38s

calculate the new a mu V so it never
02:15:40.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m40s

ends up in our G M G squared so that was
02:15:42.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m42s

like a super fast description which will
02:15:47.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m47s

probably only make sense if you listen
02:15:50.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m50s

to a three or four times on the video
02:15:51.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m51s

and then talk about it on the forum yeah
02:15:53.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m53s

but if you're interested let me know and
02:15:57.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m57s

we can also look at Ann Ann's code
02:15:59.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m59s

that's implemented yes and you know the
02:16:01.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m01s

the idea of using weight decay is it's a
02:16:08.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m08s

really helpful regularizer because it's
02:16:11.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m11s

basically this way that we can kind of
02:16:15.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m15s

stay like you know please don't increase
02:16:17.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m17s

any of the weight values unless the you
02:16:23.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m23s

know improvement in the loss is worth it
02:16:26.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m26s

and so generally speaking pretty much
02:16:31.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m31s

all state of the art models have both
02:16:34.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m34s

dropout and weight decay and I don't
02:16:36.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m36s

claim to know like how to set each one
02:16:40.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m40s

and how much of H to use to say like you
02:16:42.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m42s

it's worth trying both to go back to the
02:16:46.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m46s

idea of embeddings is there any way to
02:16:51.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m51s

interpret the final to reduce it
02:16:53.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m53s

embeddings like absolutely we're gonna
02:16:55.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m55s

look at that next week I've it's super
02:16:57.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m57s

fun it turns out that you know we'll
02:16:59.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h16m59s

learn what some of the worst movies of
02:17:01.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m01s

all time
02:17:03.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m03s

it's Letham it's that John Travolta
02:17:06.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m06s

Scientology once my battleship earth or
02:17:09.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m09s

something I think that was like the
02:17:11.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m11s

worst movie of all time according to our
02:17:12.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m12s

beds to many recommendations for scaling
02:17:14.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m14s

the l2 penalty or is that kind of based
02:17:21.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m21s

on how how wide the notes are how many
02:17:24.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m24s

notes about III have no suggestion at
02:17:27.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m27s

all like I I kind of look for like
02:17:29.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m29s

papers or cackle competitions or
02:17:32.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m32s

whatever similar and try to set up
02:17:35.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m35s

frankly the same it seems like in a
02:17:37.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m37s

particular area like computer vision
02:17:40.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m40s

object recognition it's like somewhere
02:17:43.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m43s

between one in neck four or one in egg
02:17:46.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m46s

five seems to work you know
02:17:48.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m48s

actually in the Adam W paper the authors
02:17:50.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m50s

point out that with this new approach it
02:17:55.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m55s

actually becomes like it seems to be
02:17:57.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m57s

much more stable as to what the right
02:17:58.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h17m58s

way to K amounts are so hopefully now
02:18:00.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h18m00s

when we start playing with it
02:18:02.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h18m02s

we'll be able to have some definitive
02:18:03.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h18m03s

recommendations by the time we get to
02:18:06.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h18m06s

part two all right well that's nine
