[so I I don't want to embarrass Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m01s)
00:00:01

[but I'm very excited that Rachel's here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m05s)
00:00:05

[so this is Rachel for those of you that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m06s)
00:00:06

[don't know she's not quite back on her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m08s)
00:00:08

[feet after her illness but well enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m13s)
00:00:13

[to at least come to at least part with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m15s)
00:00:15

[this lesson so worried if she can't stay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m16s)
00:00:16

[for the whole thing and I'm really glad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m18s)
00:00:18

[she's here because Rachel actually wrote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m20s)
00:00:20

[the vast majority of the lesson we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m22s)
00:00:22

[gonna see it's I think it's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m24s)
00:00:24

[really cool work so I'm glad she's gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m25s)
00:00:25

[at least see it being taught even if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m28s)
00:00:28

[unfortunately she's not teaching it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m30s)
00:00:30

[herself so good Thanksgiving present](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m32s)
00:00:32

[best for Thanksgiving present so where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m38s)
00:00:38

[as we discussed at the end of last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m42s)
00:00:42

[lesson we're kind of moving from the C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m43s)
00:00:43

[decision tree ensembles to two neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m46s)
00:00:46

[Nets broadly defined and as we discussed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m50s)
00:00:50

[you know random forests and decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m53s)
00:00:53

[trees are limited by the fact in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h00m55s)
00:00:55

[that they're basically they're basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m00s)
00:01:00

[doing nearest neighbors right you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m04s)
00:01:04

[that all they can do is to get return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m07s)
00:01:07

[the average of a bunch of other points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m09s)
00:01:09

[and so they can't extrapolate out to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m11s)
00:01:11

[know if you're thinking what happens if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m13s)
00:01:13

[I'll increase my prices by 20% and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m15s)
00:01:15

[you've never priced at that level before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m17s)
00:01:17

[or what's going to happen to sales next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m20s)
00:01:20

[year and obviously we've never seen next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m22s)
00:01:22

[year before it's very hard to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m24s)
00:01:24

[extrapolate it's also hard if it needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m26s)
00:01:26

[to you know like it can only do around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m28s)
00:01:28

[log base two n decisions you know and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m31s)
00:01:31

[if there's like a time series it needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m36s)
00:01:36

[to fit too that takes like four steps to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m38s)
00:01:38

[kind of get to the right time area then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m40s)
00:01:40

[suddenly there's not many decisions left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m43s)
00:01:43

[for it to make so it's kind of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m45s)
00:01:45

[limited amount of computation that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[can do so there's a limited complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m49s)
00:01:49

[of relationship that it can model yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m52s)
00:01:52

[Prince can I ask about one more drawback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h01m55s)
00:01:55

[of random forests yeah so if we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m02s)
00:02:02

[data as categorical variable which are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m07s)
00:02:07

[not in sequential order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m09s)
00:02:09

[so for random forests we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[and coat them and treat them as numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m13s)
00:02:13

[let's say we have 20 cardinality and 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m15s)
00:02:15

[to 20 so the result at random for our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m18s)
00:02:18

[skills is like the spirit and important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m21s)
00:02:21

[skills is something like less than 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m24s)
00:02:24

[less than 6 but if the categories are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m26s)
00:02:26

[not sequential not in any order what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m29s)
00:02:29

[does that mean yeah so so if you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m32s)
00:02:32

[like oh let's go back to bulldozers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m38s)
00:02:38

[erupts erupts with AC erupts na I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m43s)
00:02:43

[know whatever right and we arbitrarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h02m58s)
00:02:58

[label them like this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m03s)
00:03:03

[and so actually we know that all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m08s)
00:03:08

[really mattered was if it had air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m11s)
00:03:11

[conditioning so what's going to happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m12s)
00:03:12

[well it's basically going to say like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[okay if I group it into those together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m17s)
00:03:17

[and those together that like that's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m20s)
00:03:20

[interesting break just because it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m24s)
00:03:24

[happens that the air conditioning ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[are going to end up in the right hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m28s)
00:03:28

[side and then having done that right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m30s)
00:03:30

[it's then going to say okay well within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m33s)
00:03:33

[the group with the two and three it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m35s)
00:03:35

[going to notice that it's furthermore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m38s)
00:03:38

[going to have to split it into two more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m39s)
00:03:39

[groups so eventually it's going to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m41s)
00:03:41

[there it's going to pull out that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m43s)
00:03:43

[category it's just it's going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m45s)
00:03:45

[more splits than we would ideally like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m48s)
00:03:48

[so it's kind of similar to the fact that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m49s)
00:03:49

[they get to model a line it can only do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m51s)
00:03:51

[it with lots of splits and only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m55s)
00:03:55

[approximately let's just fine with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h03m57s)
00:03:57

[categories that are not sequential also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m00s)
00:04:00

[yeah so I can't do it it's just like in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m02s)
00:04:02

[some way it's sub-optimal because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m04s)
00:04:04

[just need to do more breakpoints than we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m06s)
00:04:06

[would have liked but it gets there it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m08s)
00:04:08

[does a pretty good job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m10s)
00:04:10

[and so even although random forests you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m11s)
00:04:11

[know do you have some deficiencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m14s)
00:04:14

[they're incredibly powerful you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m16s)
00:04:16

[particularly because they have so few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m20s)
00:04:20

[assumptions they really had to screw up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m21s)
00:04:21

[and you know it's kind of hard to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m23s)
00:04:23

[actually win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m25s)
00:04:25

[Cagle competition with a random first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m26s)
00:04:26

[but it's very easy to get like 10% so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m28s)
00:04:28

[like in real life where often that third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m32s)
00:04:32

[decimal place doesn't matter random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m34s)
00:04:34

[forests are often like what you end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m36s)
00:04:36

[doing but for some things like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m38s)
00:04:38

[Ecuadorian groceries competition it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m42s)
00:04:42

[very very hard to get a good result with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m44s)
00:04:44

[a random forest because like there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m46s)
00:04:46

[huge time series component and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m49s)
00:04:49

[nearly everything is these two massively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m51s)
00:04:51

[high cardinality categorical variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m53s)
00:04:53

[which is the store and the item and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m55s)
00:04:55

[so this so there's very little there to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h04m58s)
00:04:58

[even throw at a random forest and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m00s)
00:05:00

[you know the difference between every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m02s)
00:05:02

[pair of stores is kind of different in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m05s)
00:05:05

[different ways and so you know there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m08s)
00:05:08

[some things that are just hard to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m10s)
00:05:10

[even relatively good results for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m12s)
00:05:12

[random forest another example is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m15s)
00:05:15

[recognizing numbers you can get like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m19s)
00:05:19

[okay results with a random forest but in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m23s)
00:05:23

[the end they're kind of the relationship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m25s)
00:05:25

[between you know like that the spatial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m27s)
00:05:27

[structure turns out to be important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m30s)
00:05:30

[right and you kind of want to be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m33s)
00:05:33

[do like computations like finding edges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m35s)
00:05:35

[or whatever that kind of carry forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m38s)
00:05:38

[through through the computation so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m40s)
00:05:40

[know just doing a kind of a clever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m43s)
00:05:43

[nearest neighbors like a random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m46s)
00:05:46

[you know turns out not to be ideal so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m48s)
00:05:48

[it's stuff like this neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m53s)
00:05:53

[turn out that they are ideal neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[networks turn out to be something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m57s)
00:05:57

[works particularly well for both things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h05m59s)
00:05:59

[like the Ecuadorian groceries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m01s)
00:06:01

[competition so forecasting sales over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m03s)
00:06:03

[time buy store and buy item and for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m06s)
00:06:06

[things like recognizing digits and for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m09s)
00:06:09

[things like turning voice into speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m12s)
00:06:12

[and so it's kind of nice between these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m14s)
00:06:14

[two things neural nets and random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m16s)
00:06:16

[forests we kind of cover the territory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m19s)
00:06:19

[right I don't I haven't needed to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m21s)
00:06:21

[anything other than these two things for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m24s)
00:06:24

[a very long time and will actually learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m26s)
00:06:26

[I don't know them what course exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m29s)
00:06:29

[but at some point we'll learn also how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m32s)
00:06:32

[to combine the two because you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m33s)
00:06:33

[combine the two in really cool ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m34s)
00:06:34

[so here's a picture from Adam guide key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m37s)
00:06:37

[of an image so an image is just a bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m41s)
00:06:41

[of numbers right and each of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m45s)
00:06:45

[numbers is not to 255 and the dark ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m48s)
00:06:48

[are too close to 255 white ones are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m51s)
00:06:51

[close to zero all right so here is an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m54s)
00:06:54

[example of a digit from this amnesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h06m57s)
00:06:57

[data set amnesties are really old it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m00s)
00:07:00

[like a hello world of machine of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m02s)
00:07:02

[neuro-networks and so here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m04s)
00:07:04

[and so there are 28 by 28 pixels if it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m06s)
00:07:06

[was color there would be three of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m12s)
00:07:12

[one for red one for green okay so our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m14s)
00:07:14

[job is to look at you know the array of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m19s)
00:07:19

[numbers and figure out that this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m22s)
00:07:22

[number eight which is tricky right how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m25s)
00:07:25

[do we do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m29s)
00:07:29

[so we're going to use a few a small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m30s)
00:07:30

[number of fast AI pieces and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m35s)
00:07:35

[gradually going to remove more and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m38s)
00:07:38

[and more until by the end we'll have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m39s)
00:07:39

[implemented our own euro network from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m41s)
00:07:41

[stretch our own training loop from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m45s)
00:07:45

[scratch and our own matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m46s)
00:07:46

[multiplication from scratch so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m47s)
00:07:47

[gradually going to dig in further and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[further alright so the data for amnesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m52s)
00:07:52

[which is the name of this very famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m57s)
00:07:57

[data set is available from here and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[have a thing in fast AI dot IO called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m04s)
00:08:04

[get data which will grab it from a URL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[and store it from your on your computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m09s)
00:08:09

[unless it's already there in which case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m11s)
00:08:11

[it'll just go ahead and use it okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[then we've got a little function here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m15s)
00:08:15

[called load em nest which simply loads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m17s)
00:08:17

[it up you'll see that it's zipped so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[could just use pythons gzip to open it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m25s)
00:08:25

[up and then it's also pickled so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[have any kind of Python object at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m30s)
00:08:30

[you can use this built-in etham library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m33s)
00:08:33

[called pickle to dump it out onto your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m37s)
00:08:37

[disk share it around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m41s)
00:08:41

[load it up later and you get back the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m43s)
00:08:43

[same Python object you started with so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m45s)
00:08:45

[you've already seen this something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m48s)
00:08:48

[this with like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[pandas feather format right pickle is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m51s)
00:08:51

[not just for pandas it's not just for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m55s)
00:08:55

[anything it works for basically nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h08m58s)
00:08:58

[every - object so which might lead to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m00s)
00:09:00

[the question well why didn't we use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m04s)
00:09:04

[pickle for a panda's data frame right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m06s)
00:09:06

[and the answer is pickle works for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m08s)
00:09:08

[nearly every Python object but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[probably not like optimal for nearly any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m14s)
00:09:14

[Python object right so because like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m17s)
00:09:17

[were looking at pandas dataframes with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m20s)
00:09:20

[like over a hundred million rows we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m21s)
00:09:21

[really want to save that quickly and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m24s)
00:09:24

[feather is a format that's specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m26s)
00:09:26

[designed for that purpose and so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m28s)
00:09:28

[going to do that really fast if we tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m30s)
00:09:30

[to pickle it it would have been taken a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m32s)
00:09:32

[lot longer right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m34s)
00:09:34

[also note that pickle files are only for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[Python so you can't give them to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m41s)
00:09:41

[somebody else where else like a feather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m43s)
00:09:43

[file you can hand around yeah so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m44s)
00:09:44

[worth knowing that pickle exists because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m48s)
00:09:48

[if you've got some dictionary or some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m50s)
00:09:50

[kind of object floating around that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m53s)
00:09:53

[want to save for later or send to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m56s)
00:09:56

[somebody else you can always just pickle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h09m58s)
00:09:58

[it okay so in this particular case the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[folks at deep learning network kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m03s)
00:10:03

[enough to provide a pickled version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m05s)
00:10:05

[pickle has changed slightly over time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m10s)
00:10:10

[and so old pickle files like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m15s)
00:10:15

[you actually have to this was a Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m18s)
00:10:18

[to one so you have to tell it that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m20s)
00:10:20

[was encoded using this particular Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m22s)
00:10:22

[2 character set but other than that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m24s)
00:10:24

[Python 2 &amp; 3 you can normally open each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m26s)
00:10:26

[other's pickle files all right so once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m30s)
00:10:30

[we floated that in we loaded in like so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m32s)
00:10:32

[and so this thing which we're doing here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m36s)
00:10:36

[this is called D structuring and so D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m38s)
00:10:38

[structuring means that load M nest is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m40s)
00:10:40

[giving us back a couple of tuples and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m42s)
00:10:42

[if we have on the left hand side of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m46s)
00:10:46

[equal sign a couple of tuples we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m49s)
00:10:49

[fill all these things in so we're given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m51s)
00:10:51

[back a couple of training data a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m53s)
00:10:53

[of validation data and a couple of test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m56s)
00:10:56

[data in this case I don't care about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h10m59s)
00:10:59

[test data so I just put it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m01s)
00:11:01

[variable called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m03s)
00:11:03

[score which kind of by like people in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m04s)
00:11:04

[pick Python people tend to think of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m09s)
00:11:09

[underscore as being a special variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m11s)
00:11:11

[which we put things we're going to throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m13s)
00:11:13

[away into it's actually not special but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m15s)
00:11:15

[it's just it's really common if you see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m18s)
00:11:18

[something assigned to underscore it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m19s)
00:11:19

[probably means you're just throwing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m21s)
00:11:21

[away right by the way in a jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m22s)
00:11:22

[notebook it does have a special meaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m25s)
00:11:25

[which is the last cell that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m27s)
00:11:27

[calculate is always available in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m30s)
00:11:30

[underscore by the way but that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[a separate issue so then the first thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m34s)
00:11:34

[in that topple is itself at Apple and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m38s)
00:11:38

[we're going to stick that into X&amp;Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m41s)
00:11:41

[for our training data and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m43s)
00:11:43

[second one goes into X&amp;Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m45s)
00:11:45

[for our validation data okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m47s)
00:11:47

[called destructuring and it's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m50s)
00:11:50

[common in lots of languages some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m52s)
00:11:52

[languages don't support it but those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m55s)
00:11:55

[that do life becomes a lot easier so as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m57s)
00:11:57

[soon as I you know look at some new data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h11m59s)
00:11:59

[set I just check out what's what if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m01s)
00:12:01

[got all right so what's its tight okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m03s)
00:12:03

[it's an umpire right what's its shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m06s)
00:12:06

[it's 50,000 by seven eight four and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m08s)
00:12:08

[what about the dependent variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m12s)
00:12:12

[that's an array its shape is 50,000 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[this image is not of length seven eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m19s)
00:12:19

[four it's at size 28 by 28 so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m24s)
00:12:24

[happened here well we could guess and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m28s)
00:12:28

[can check on the website it turns that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[we would be right that all they did was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m33s)
00:12:33

[they took the second row and concatenate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m34s)
00:12:34

[it to the first row and the third row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m37s)
00:12:37

[and concatenate it to that and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m39s)
00:12:39

[fourth row and competitive's of that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m40s)
00:12:40

[in other words they took this whole 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m41s)
00:12:41

[by 28 and flattened it out into a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m43s)
00:12:43

[1d array that makes sense so it's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m47s)
00:12:47

[to be of size 28 squared this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m50s)
00:12:50

[like normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m55s)
00:12:55

[by any means so don't think like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m56s)
00:12:56

[everything you see is going to be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h12m58s)
00:12:58

[this most of the time when people share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m00s)
00:13:00

[images they share them as JPEGs or PNG s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m02s)
00:13:02

[you load them up you get back a nice 2d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m05s)
00:13:05

[array but in this particular case for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m08s)
00:13:08

[whatever reason the thing that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m11s)
00:13:11

[pickled was flattened out to be 784](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m13s)
00:13:13

[and this word flatten is very common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m18s)
00:13:18

[with you know kind of working with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[tenses so when you flatten a tensor it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m23s)
00:13:23

[just means that you're turning it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[a lower rank tensor than you start up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m28s)
00:13:28

[with in this case we started with a rank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m31s)
00:13:31

[two tensor and the matrix for each image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m33s)
00:13:33

[and we turned each one into a rank one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m36s)
00:13:36

[tensor ie a vector so overall the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m38s)
00:13:38

[thing you know is a rank two matrix for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m42s)
00:13:42

[a rank two tensor rather than a rank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m46s)
00:13:46

[three tensor so just to remind us of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m48s)
00:13:48

[know the jargon here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m52s)
00:13:52

[this and math we would call a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h13m57s)
00:13:57

[right in computer science we would call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m03s)
00:14:03

[it a 1d array but because deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m06s)
00:14:06

[have people have to come across as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m11s)
00:14:11

[smarter than everybody else we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m13s)
00:14:13

[call this a rank 1 tensor okay they all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m16s)
00:14:16

[mean the same thing more or less unless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m21s)
00:14:21

[you're a physicist in which case this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m23s)
00:14:23

[means something else and you get very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m25s)
00:14:25

[angry at the deep learning people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[because you say it's not a tensor so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m28s)
00:14:28

[there you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m31s)
00:14:31

[don't blame me this is just what people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m32s)
00:14:32

[say so this is either a matrix or a 2d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m34s)
00:14:34

[array or a rank two tensor and so once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m41s)
00:14:41

[we start to get into three dimensions we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m49s)
00:14:49

[start to run out of mathematical names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m50s)
00:14:50

[right which is why we start to be nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m53s)
00:14:53

[just to say rank three tensor and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[there's actually nothing special about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h14m58s)
00:14:58

[vectors and matrices that make them in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m00s)
00:15:00

[any way more important than rank three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m02s)
00:15:02

[tenses or rank for tensors or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m06s)
00:15:06

[so I try not to use the terms vector and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[matrix where possible because I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m11s)
00:15:11

[really think they're there any more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[special than any other rank of tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[okay so kind of it's good to get used to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m19s)
00:15:19

[thinking of this as a rank two tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m21s)
00:15:21

[okay and then the the rows and columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m24s)
00:15:24

[if it was a if we're computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m38s)
00:15:38

[people we would call this dimension zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m40s)
00:15:40

[and dimension one but if we're deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[learning people we would call this axis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m48s)
00:15:48

[zero or access one okay and then just to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m51s)
00:15:51

[be really confusing if you're an image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h15m58s)
00:15:58

[person this is the first axis and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[is the second axis all right so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m03s)
00:16:03

[think about like TVs you know 1920 by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m06s)
00:16:06

[1080 columns by rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[everybody else including deep-learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m11s)
00:16:11

[and mathematicians rows by columns so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m14s)
00:16:14

[this is pretty confusing if you use like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m17s)
00:16:17

[the Python imaging library you get back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m19s)
00:16:19

[columns by rows pretty much everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m22s)
00:16:22

[else rows by columns so be careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m24s)
00:16:24

[because they hate us because they're bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m32s)
00:16:32

[I guess I mean there's a lot of just um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m33s)
00:16:33

[particularly in deep learning like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m43s)
00:16:43

[whole lot of different areas have come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m45s)
00:16:45

[together like information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m46s)
00:16:46

[computer vision statistics signal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m48s)
00:16:48

[processing and - you've ended up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m50s)
00:16:50

[this hodgepodge of nomenclature in deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m52s)
00:16:52

[learning often like every version of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m55s)
00:16:55

[things will be used so today we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h16m57s)
00:16:57

[to hear about something that's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m00s)
00:17:00

[either negative log likelihood or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m01s)
00:17:01

[binomial or categorical cross entropy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[depending on where you come from we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m06s)
00:17:06

[already seen something that's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m09s)
00:17:09

[either one hot encoding or dummy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m10s)
00:17:10

[variables depending on where you come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m12s)
00:17:12

[from it really is just like the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m14s)
00:17:14

[concept gets kind of somewhat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m15s)
00:17:15

[independently invented in different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m18s)
00:17:18

[fields and eventually they find their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m19s)
00:17:19

[way to machine learning and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m21s)
00:17:21

[don't know what to call them so we call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m23s)
00:17:23

[them all of the above something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m25s)
00:17:25

[that so I think that's what's happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m28s)
00:17:28

[with with computer vision rows and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m30s)
00:17:30

[columns so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m32s)
00:17:32

[there's this idea of normalizing data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m37s)
00:17:37

[which is subtracting out the mean and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m39s)
00:17:39

[dividing by the standard deviation so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m41s)
00:17:41

[question for you do like often it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m46s)
00:17:46

[important to normalize the data so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m51s)
00:17:51

[we can more easily train a model do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m53s)
00:17:53

[think it would be important to normalize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m56s)
00:17:56

[the independent variables for a random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h17m59s)
00:17:59

[forest if we're training a random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m01s)
00:18:01

[be honest I don't know why we don't need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m07s)
00:18:07

[to normalize I just know that we've done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m11s)
00:18:11

[okay does anybody want to think about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[why kara it wouldn't matter because each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m16s)
00:18:16

[scaling and transformation we can have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m21s)
00:18:21

[will be applied to each row and we will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m25s)
00:18:25

[be computing means as we were doing like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m28s)
00:18:28

[local averages and at the end we will of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[course want to denormalize it back to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m34s)
00:18:34

[give so it wouldn't change the results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m38s)
00:18:38

[I'm doing about the independent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m40s)
00:18:40

[variables not the dependent variable I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m41s)
00:18:41

[taught to us the world depend okay let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m43s)
00:18:43

[have a go Matthew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m46s)
00:18:46

[it might be because we just care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m51s)
00:18:51

[the relationship between the independent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m53s)
00:18:53

[variables an independent variable so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m55s)
00:18:55

[scale doesn't matter okay come on cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h18m57s)
00:18:57

[why why well why do we own we could like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[because at each split point we can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[divide to see which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m07s)
00:19:07

[regardless of what scale you're on what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m12s)
00:19:12

[minimizes variance and that would right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m14s)
00:19:14

[so really the key is that when we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m17s)
00:19:17

[deciding where to split all that matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m19s)
00:19:19

[is the order like it all that matters is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m22s)
00:19:22

[how they're sorted so if we divide by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m25s)
00:19:25

[the subtract the mean and divide by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m27s)
00:19:27

[standard deviation they're still sorted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m29s)
00:19:29

[in the same order so remember when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m31s)
00:19:31

[implemented the random first we said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m32s)
00:19:32

[sort them and then we liked it then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[completely ignored the values we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[said like now add on one thing from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m38s)
00:19:38

[dependent at a time so so random forests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m41s)
00:19:41

[only care about the sort order of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m45s)
00:19:45

[independent variables they don't care at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[all about their size and so that's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m50s)
00:19:50

[they're wonderfully immune to outliers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m53s)
00:19:53

[because they totally ignore the fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m55s)
00:19:55

[that it's an outlier they only care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m57s)
00:19:57

[about which one's higher than what other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h19m59s)
00:19:59

[thing right so this is an important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m01s)
00:20:01

[concept it doesn't just appear in random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m03s)
00:20:03

[forests it occurs in some metrics as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m05s)
00:20:05

[well for example area under the ROC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m07s)
00:20:07

[curve you come across a lot that area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m09s)
00:20:09

[under the ROC curve completely ignores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m12s)
00:20:12

[scale and only cares about sort we saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m15s)
00:20:15

[something else when we did the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m19s)
00:20:19

[dendrogram Spearman's correlation is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[rank correlation only cares about order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[not about scale so random forests one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[the many wonderful things about them are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m31s)
00:20:31

[that we can completely ignore a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m32s)
00:20:32

[these statistical distribution issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m35s)
00:20:35

[but we can't for deep learning because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m38s)
00:20:38

[for deep learning we're trying to train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m40s)
00:20:40

[a parameterised model so we do need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m43s)
00:20:43

[normalize our data if we don't then it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m46s)
00:20:46

[going to be much harder to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[network that trains effectively so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m51s)
00:20:51

[grab the mean and the standard deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m54s)
00:20:54

[of our training data and subtract out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m55s)
00:20:55

[the mean divided by the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m58s)
00:20:58

[deviation and that gives us a mean of 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h20m59s)
00:20:59

[and a standard deviation of 1 now for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m02s)
00:21:02

[our validation data we need to use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m05s)
00:21:05

[standard deviation and mean from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m09s)
00:21:09

[training data right we have to normalize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m11s)
00:21:11

[it the same way just like categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m13s)
00:21:13

[variables we had to make sure they had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[the same indexes mapped to the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m18s)
00:21:18

[levels for a random forest or missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m20s)
00:21:20

[values we had to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m24s)
00:21:24

[make sure we have the same median used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m25s)
00:21:25

[when we were replacing the missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m27s)
00:21:27

[values you need to make sure anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m29s)
00:21:29

[you do in the training set you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m31s)
00:21:31

[exactly the same thing and the test and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m33s)
00:21:33

[validation set so here I'm subtracting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m35s)
00:21:35

[out the training set me in the training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m37s)
00:21:37

[set standard deviation so this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m38s)
00:21:38

[exactly zero this is not exactly one but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m40s)
00:21:40

[it's pretty close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m43s)
00:21:43

[and so in general if you find you try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m44s)
00:21:44

[something on a validation set or a test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m48s)
00:21:48

[set and it's like much much much worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m49s)
00:21:49

[than your training set that's probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m52s)
00:21:52

[because you normalized in an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m55s)
00:21:55

[inconsistent way or encoded category is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m57s)
00:21:57

[an inconsistent way or something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h21m59s)
00:21:59

[that all right so let's take a look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m01s)
00:22:01

[some of this data so we've got 10,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m05s)
00:22:05

[images in the validation set and each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m09s)
00:22:09

[one is a rank one tensor of length seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m12s)
00:22:12

[eight four in order to display it I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m14s)
00:22:14

[to turn it into a rank two tensor of 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m18s)
00:22:18

[by 28 so there's a dump a has a reshape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m20s)
00:22:20

[function that takes a tensor in and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m25s)
00:22:25

[reshapes it to whatever size tensor you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m31s)
00:22:31

[request now if you think about it you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m34s)
00:22:34

[only need to tell it about if there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m37s)
00:22:37

[d axes you only need to tell it about D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m41s)
00:22:41

[minus one of the axes you want because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m43s)
00:22:43

[the last one it can figure out for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m46s)
00:22:46

[itself right so in total there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m47s)
00:22:47

[10,000 by 784 numbers here altogether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m50s)
00:22:50

[right so if you say well I want my last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m54s)
00:22:54

[axes to be 28 by 28 then you can figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h22m57s)
00:22:57

[out that this must be 10,000 otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m01s)
00:23:01

[it's not going to fit it makes sense so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m05s)
00:23:05

[if you put minus 1 it says like make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m08s)
00:23:08

[as big or as small as you have to to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m11s)
00:23:11

[make it fit and so you can see here it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m13s)
00:23:13

[figure it out it has to be 10,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m14s)
00:23:14

[so you'll see this used in neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m17s)
00:23:17

[software pre-processing and stuff like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m21s)
00:23:21

[that all the time like I could have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m24s)
00:23:24

[written 10,000 here but I try to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m26s)
00:23:26

[into a habit of like anytime I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m28s)
00:23:28

[referring to like how many items in my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m30s)
00:23:30

[input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m32s)
00:23:32

[I tend to use minus one because like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m33s)
00:23:33

[just means later on I could like use a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m36s)
00:23:36

[subsample this code wouldn't break I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m38s)
00:23:38

[could you know do some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m41s)
00:23:41

[stratified sampling it was unbalanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m42s)
00:23:42

[this code wouldn't break so by using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m44s)
00:23:44

[this kind of approach of saying like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m46s)
00:23:46

[minus one here for the size it just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m48s)
00:23:48

[makes it more resilient to change us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m51s)
00:23:51

[later it's a good habit to get into so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m52s)
00:23:52

[this kind of idea of like being able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m56s)
00:23:56

[take tensors and reshape them and and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h23m58s)
00:23:58

[and change axes around and stuff like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m01s)
00:24:01

[that is something you need to be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m04s)
00:24:04

[totally do without thinking because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m07s)
00:24:07

[going to happen all the time so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m11s)
00:24:11

[example here's one I tried to read in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m13s)
00:24:13

[some images they were flattened I need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m15s)
00:24:15

[to unflattering them into a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m18s)
00:24:18

[matrices okay reshape thing I read some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m20s)
00:24:20

[I read some images in with OpenCV and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m24s)
00:24:24

[turns out OpenCV orders the channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m26s)
00:24:26

[blue green red everything else expects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[them to be red green blue I need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m33s)
00:24:33

[reverse the last access how do you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m34s)
00:24:34

[that I read in some images with place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m37s)
00:24:37

[and imaging library it reads them as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m40s)
00:24:40

[know rows by columns by channels quiet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m43s)
00:24:43

[which expects channels by rows by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m47s)
00:24:47

[columns how do I transform that so these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m49s)
00:24:49

[are all things you need to be able to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m52s)
00:24:52

[without thinking like straightaway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m55s)
00:24:55

[because they just it happens all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m57s)
00:24:57

[time and you never want to be sitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h24m59s)
00:24:59

[there thinking about it for ages so make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m02s)
00:25:02

[sure you spend a lot of time over the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m03s)
00:25:03

[week just practicing with things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m06s)
00:25:06

[all the stuff ago to see today reshaping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m08s)
00:25:08

[slicing reordering dimensions stuff like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m10s)
00:25:10

[that and so the best way is to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m15s)
00:25:15

[some small tensors yourself and start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m16s)
00:25:16

[thinking like okay what shall I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m20s)
00:25:20

[experiment with so here can we pass that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m22s)
00:25:22

[over there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m25s)
00:25:25

[a backtrack a little bit of course I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m28s)
00:25:28

[love it so back in normalize you say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m29s)
00:25:29

[like you might have gone over this but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m32s)
00:25:32

[I'm still like wrestling with a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m34s)
00:25:34

[bit yes in many machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m37s)
00:25:37

[algorithms or Milan yeah but you also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[just said that scale isn't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m41s)
00:25:41

[mattered so I said it doesn't matter for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m43s)
00:25:43

[random forests yeah so random forests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m46s)
00:25:46

[are just kind of split things based on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m49s)
00:25:49

[order and so we loved them we love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m51s)
00:25:51

[random forests further away there so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m54s)
00:25:54

[immune to worrying about distributional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m56s)
00:25:56

[assumptions but we're not doing random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h25m58s)
00:25:58

[forests we're doing deep learning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m00s)
00:26:00

[deep learning does care can you pass it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m01s)
00:26:01

[over there we have a parametric don't we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m05s)
00:26:05

[should skill no not quite right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m09s)
00:26:09

[like K nearest neighbors is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[nonparametric and scale matters a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m17s)
00:26:17

[helluva lot so I would say things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m19s)
00:26:19

[involving trees generally you're just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m22s)
00:26:22

[going to split at a point and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m24s)
00:26:24

[probably you don't care about scale but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m26s)
00:26:26

[you know you probably just need to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m28s)
00:26:28

[like is this an algorithm that uses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m30s)
00:26:30

[order or does it use specific numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m33s)
00:26:33

[and can you please give us an intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m37s)
00:26:37

[of why it needs scale just Bureau says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m40s)
00:26:40

[that would make modify simulations not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m43s)
00:26:43

[until we get to doing SGD so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m47s)
00:26:47

[to get to that yeah so for now we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m49s)
00:26:49

[just gonna say take my word for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m51s)
00:26:51

[okay positive Daniel so this is probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m53s)
00:26:53

[a dumb question but can you like explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m56s)
00:26:56

[a little bit more what you mean by scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h26m58s)
00:26:58

[because I guess when I think of scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m00s)
00:27:00

[I'm like oh all the numbers should be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m02s)
00:27:02

[generally the same size that's like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m04s)
00:27:04

[mean but is that like the case like with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m07s)
00:27:07

[the cats and dogs that we went over with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m09s)
00:27:09

[like the deep learning like you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m11s)
00:27:11

[have a small cat and like a larger cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m13s)
00:27:13

[but it would still know that those were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m15s)
00:27:15

[both cats oh I guess you know this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[one of these problems where language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m19s)
00:27:19

[gets overloaded yeah so in computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m20s)
00:27:20

[vision when we scale an image we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m22s)
00:27:22

[actually increasing the size of the cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m25s)
00:27:25

[in this case we're scaling the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m26s)
00:27:26

[pixel values so in both case Kali means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m29s)
00:27:29

[to make something bigger and smaller in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m33s)
00:27:33

[this case we're taking armors from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[naught to 255 and making them so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m36s)
00:27:36

[they have an average of 0 and a standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m39s)
00:27:39

[deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m41s)
00:27:41

[unit one Jeremy could you please explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m42s)
00:27:42

[us is it by column by row by pixel by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m45s)
00:27:45

[pixel so when you're scaling I'm just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m51s)
00:27:51

[not thinking about every picture but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m56s)
00:27:56

[am kind of an input yeah so okay yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h27m59s)
00:27:59

[sure so I mean it's a little bit subtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m01s)
00:28:01

[but in this case I've just got a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[mean and a single standard deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m05s)
00:28:05

[right so it's basically on average how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m07s)
00:28:07

[how much black is there right and so on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[average you know we have a mean and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m15s)
00:28:15

[standard deviation across all the pixels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[in computer vision we would normally do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[it by channel so we would normally have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m24s)
00:28:24

[one number for read one number for green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m26s)
00:28:26

[one number for blue in general you you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[need a different set of normalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m35s)
00:28:35

[coefficients for each leg each thing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m37s)
00:28:37

[would expect to behave differently so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m40s)
00:28:40

[we were doing like a structured data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m43s)
00:28:43

[where we've got like income distance in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m44s)
00:28:44

[kilometers and a number of children but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m48s)
00:28:48

[you need three separate normalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m51s)
00:28:51

[coefficients for those they're like very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m53s)
00:28:53

[different kinds of things so yeah it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m55s)
00:28:55

[kind of like a bit domain-specific here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h28m58s)
00:28:58

[it's like in this case all of the pixels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m01s)
00:29:01

[are you know levels of gray so we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m03s)
00:29:03

[got a single scaling number where else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m07s)
00:29:07

[you could imagine if they were red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m09s)
00:29:09

[versus cream versus blue you could need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m10s)
00:29:10

[to scale those channels in different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m12s)
00:29:12

[ways and plus they're better please so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m14s)
00:29:14

[I'm having a little bit of trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m19s)
00:29:19

[imagining what would happen if you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m21s)
00:29:21

[normalize in this case um so we'll get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m23s)
00:29:23

[there so for next oh wait so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[kind of what your net was saying is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[why would we normalize and for now we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m29s)
00:29:29

[normalizing because I say we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m32s)
00:29:32

[when we get to looking at stochastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m34s)
00:29:34

[gradient descent will basically discover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m36s)
00:29:36

[that if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m39s)
00:29:39

[basically to skip ahead a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[we're going to be doing a matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m44s)
00:29:44

[multiply by a bunch of weights we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[going to pick those weights in such a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m48s)
00:29:48

[way that when we do the matrix multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m50s)
00:29:50

[we're going to try to keep the numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m51s)
00:29:51

[at the same scale that they started out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m53s)
00:29:53

[as and that's going to basically require](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m55s)
00:29:55

[the initial numbers we're going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h29m58s)
00:29:58

[to know what their scale is so basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m00s)
00:30:00

[it's much easier to create a single kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m02s)
00:30:02

[of neural network architecture that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m05s)
00:30:05

[works for lots of different kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m07s)
00:30:07

[inputs if we know that they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m08s)
00:30:08

[consistently going to be mean 0 standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[deviation 1 that would be the short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m13s)
00:30:13

[answer but we'll learn a lot more about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m15s)
00:30:15

[it and if in a couple of lessons you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[still not quite sure why let's come back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m21s)
00:30:21

[to it because it's a really interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[thing to talk about yes I'm just trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m25s)
00:30:25

[to visualize the axes we're working with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m29s)
00:30:29

[you so under plots when you when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m31s)
00:30:31

[write x valid shape we get ten thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m33s)
00:30:33

[by seven eight four yeah that mean that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m35s)
00:30:35

[we brought in 10,000 pictures yeah of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m38s)
00:30:38

[that dimension exactly okay and then in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[the next line when you choose to reshape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

[it is there a reason why you put 28 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m46s)
00:30:46

[on azzam Y or z coordinates or is there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m48s)
00:30:48

[a reason why they're in that order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m52s)
00:30:52

[yeah there is pretty much all neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m53s)
00:30:53

[network libraries assume that the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h30m58s)
00:30:58

[axis it's like kind of the equivalent of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m01s)
00:31:01

[a row it's like a separate thing it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m04s)
00:31:04

[sentence or an image or you know example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m06s)
00:31:06

[of sales or whatever so I want each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m10s)
00:31:10

[image you know to be as a separate item](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m13s)
00:31:13

[of the first axis and then so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m17s)
00:31:17

[leaves two more axes for the rows and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m20s)
00:31:20

[columns of the images and that's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m21s)
00:31:21

[standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m23s)
00:31:23

[that's totally standard yeah I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m24s)
00:31:24

[think I've ever seen a library that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m26s)
00:31:26

[doesn't work that way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m27s)
00:31:27

[can you pass the table here so while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m28s)
00:31:28

[normalizing the validation data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m39s)
00:31:39

[I saw you have used mean of X and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m41s)
00:31:41

[standard deviation of X data training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m45s)
00:31:45

[data only yes so shouldn't we use mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m47s)
00:31:47

[and standard deviation of validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m50s)
00:31:50

[data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m52s)
00:31:52

[you mean like join them together or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m53s)
00:31:53

[separately goodwill didn't mean no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m55s)
00:31:55

[because you see then you would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h31m58s)
00:31:58

[normalizing the validation set using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m00s)
00:32:00

[different numbers and so now the meaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m02s)
00:32:02

[of like this this pixel has a value of 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m04s)
00:32:04

[in the validation set has a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m08s)
00:32:08

[meaning to the meaning of 3 in the in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m10s)
00:32:10

[the training set it would be like if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m12s)
00:32:12

[had like days of the week encoded such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m16s)
00:32:16

[that Monday was a 1 in the training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m19s)
00:32:19

[and was a 0 in the validation set we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m21s)
00:32:21

[got now two different sets where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m25s)
00:32:25

[same number has a different meaning so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m27s)
00:32:27

[we we want to make sure that we so let](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[me give an example let's say we were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[doing like full-color images and our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m34s)
00:32:34

[tests their training set can contained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m38s)
00:32:38

[like green frogs green snakes and gray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m41s)
00:32:41

[elephants right we're trying to figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m44s)
00:32:44

[out which was which now we normalized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m45s)
00:32:45

[using you know the each channel mean and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m47s)
00:32:47

[then we have a validation set and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m51s)
00:32:51

[test set which are just green frogs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m55s)
00:32:55

[green snakes so if we would have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h32m57s)
00:32:57

[normalized by the validation sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m00s)
00:33:00

[statistics we would end up saying things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m03s)
00:33:03

[on average a green and so we would like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m05s)
00:33:05

[remove all the greenness out and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m08s)
00:33:08

[would now fail to recognize the green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m11s)
00:33:11

[frogs and the green snakes effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[right so we actually want to use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m16s)
00:33:16

[same normalization coefficients that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m18s)
00:33:18

[were training on and for those of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m20s)
00:33:20

[doing the deep learning class we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m22s)
00:33:22

[actually go further than that when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m24s)
00:33:24

[use a pre tracking network we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m26s)
00:33:26

[use the same normalization coefficients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m27s)
00:33:27

[that the original authors trained on so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m29s)
00:33:29

[the idea is that you know that the a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m31s)
00:33:31

[number needs to have this consistent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m34s)
00:33:34

[meaning across every data set where you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m37s)
00:33:37

[use it how can you pass the test meter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[that means when you are looking at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m48s)
00:33:48

[test set you normalize the test set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m50s)
00:33:50

[based on this this meanness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m53s)
00:33:53

[that's right okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m55s)
00:33:55

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h33m59s)
00:33:59

[so um here's a you know so so the valid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m02s)
00:34:02

[validation y-values I just rank one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m06s)
00:34:06

[tensor of 10,000 remember there's this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m10s)
00:34:10

[kind of weird Python thing where at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m12s)
00:34:12

[Apple with just one thing in it there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m15s)
00:34:15

[a trailing comma okay so this is a rank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m17s)
00:34:17

[one tensor of length 10,000 and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m20s)
00:34:20

[here's an example of something from that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m23s)
00:34:23

[it's just the number three so that's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m24s)
00:34:24

[labels so here's another thing you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m27s)
00:34:27

[to be able to do in your sleep slicing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m30s)
00:34:30

[into a tensor so in this case we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m32s)
00:34:32

[slicing into the first axis with 0 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m36s)
00:34:36

[that means we're grabbing the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m40s)
00:34:40

[slice so because this is a single number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m41s)
00:34:41

[this is going to reduce the rank of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m45s)
00:34:45

[tensor by one it's going to turn it from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m47s)
00:34:47

[a 3-dimensional tensor into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m49s)
00:34:49

[two-dimensional tensor right so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m51s)
00:34:51

[see here this is now just a matrix and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m53s)
00:34:53

[then we're going to grab 10 through 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m56s)
00:34:56

[inclusive rows 10 through 14 inclusive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h34m58s)
00:34:58

[columns and here it is right so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m01s)
00:35:01

[the kind of thing you need to be super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m04s)
00:35:04

[comfortable like grabbing pieces out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m06s)
00:35:06

[looking at the numbers and looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m08s)
00:35:08

[the picture right so here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m11s)
00:35:11

[of a little piece of that first image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m13s)
00:35:13

[and so you kind of want to get used to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m16s)
00:35:16

[this idea that if you're working with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m21s)
00:35:21

[something like pictures or audio you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m22s)
00:35:22

[know this is something your brain is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m25s)
00:35:25

[really good at interpreting right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m26s)
00:35:26

[like keep showing pictures of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m28s)
00:35:28

[you're doing whenever you can but also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m30s)
00:35:30

[remember behind the scenes they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m33s)
00:35:33

[numbers so like if something's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m34s)
00:35:34

[weird print out a few of the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m36s)
00:35:36

[numbers you might find somehow some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m39s)
00:35:39

[them have become infinity or they're all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m40s)
00:35:40

[0 or whatever right so like use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[interactive environment and to explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m46s)
00:35:46

[the data as you go did you have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m49s)
00:35:49

[question with just a quick I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h35m54s)
00:35:54

[semantic question why when it's a tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m00s)
00:36:00

[of Rank 3 is it stored as like XYZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m04s)
00:36:04

[instead of like tamiya would make more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m08s)
00:36:08

[sense to store it as like a list of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m10s)
00:36:10

[2d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m13s)
00:36:13

[tensors its let's do it as either right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m13s)
00:36:13

[so remember the formatting because let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m17s)
00:36:17

[look at this as a 3d okay so here's a 3d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m20s)
00:36:20

[right so a 3d tensor is formatted as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m23s)
00:36:23

[showing a list of 2d tensors basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m27s)
00:36:27

[but when you're extracting it why isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[it like if you're extracting the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m34s)
00:36:34

[one why isn't it X images square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m36s)
00:36:36

[brackets 0 close square brackets and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m39s)
00:36:39

[then a second set of squares because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m41s)
00:36:41

[this has a different meaning right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m44s)
00:36:44

[it's kind of the difference between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m47s)
00:36:47

[tenses and jagged arrays right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m50s)
00:36:50

[basically if you do like something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m53s)
00:36:53

[something like that that says take the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h36m55s)
00:36:55

[second list item and from it grab the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m00s)
00:37:00

[third list item and so we tend to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m02s)
00:37:02

[that when we have something called a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m04s)
00:37:04

[jagged array which is where each sub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m05s)
00:37:05

[array may be of a different length right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m07s)
00:37:07

[where else we have like a single object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m09s)
00:37:09

[of three dimensions and so we're trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m14s)
00:37:14

[to say like which little piece of it do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m17s)
00:37:17

[we want and so the idea is that that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m21s)
00:37:21

[a single slice object to go in and grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m23s)
00:37:23

[that piece out ok so here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m27s)
00:37:27

[of a few of those images along with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m36s)
00:37:36

[their labels and this kind of stuff you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m40s)
00:37:40

[want to be able to do pretty quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m43s)
00:37:43

[with matplotlib it's it's going to help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m45s)
00:37:45

[you a lot in in life in your exam so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m48s)
00:37:48

[can have a look at you know what Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m51s)
00:37:51

[wrote here when she wrote plots we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[use we can use add sub plot to basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h37m56s)
00:37:56

[create those little separate plots and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m00s)
00:38:00

[you need to know that I am show is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m03s)
00:38:03

[we basically take a numpy array and draw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[it as a picture okay and then we've also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m09s)
00:38:09

[added the title on top so there it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m12s)
00:38:12

[all right so let's you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m18s)
00:38:18

[take that data and try to build a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m25s)
00:38:25

[network with it and so a neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m29s)
00:38:29

[and sorry this is going to be a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m33s)
00:38:33

[review for those of you already doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m35s)
00:38:35

[deep learning a neural network is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m36s)
00:38:36

[particular mathematical function or a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m39s)
00:38:39

[class of mathematical functions but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m41s)
00:38:41

[a really important class because it has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m43s)
00:38:43

[the property it supports what's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m45s)
00:38:45

[the universal approximation theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m47s)
00:38:47

[which is that which means that a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m49s)
00:38:49

[network can approximate any other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m52s)
00:38:52

[function arbitrarily closely right so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m54s)
00:38:54

[other words it can do in theory it can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h38m58s)
00:38:58

[do anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m00s)
00:39:00

[as long as we make it big enough so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m01s)
00:39:01

[is very different to a function like 3x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m05s)
00:39:05

[plus 5 right which can only do one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m09s)
00:39:09

[it's a very specific function or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m12s)
00:39:12

[class of functions ax plus B which can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m15s)
00:39:15

[only represent lines of different slopes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m19s)
00:39:19

[moving it up and down different amounts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m22s)
00:39:22

[or even the function ax squared plus BX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m24s)
00:39:24

[plus C plus sine D you know again only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m28s)
00:39:28

[can represent a very specific subset of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m31s)
00:39:31

[relationships the neural network however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m34s)
00:39:34

[is a function that can represent any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m37s)
00:39:37

[other function to arbitrarily close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m40s)
00:39:40

[accuracy right so what we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m42s)
00:39:42

[is we're going to learn how to take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m45s)
00:39:45

[function so let's take like ax plus B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m47s)
00:39:47

[and we're going to learn how to find its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m49s)
00:39:49

[parameters in this case a and B which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m52s)
00:39:52

[allow it to fit as closely as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m54s)
00:39:54

[to a set of data and so this here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m56s)
00:39:56

[showing example from a notebook that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h39m59s)
00:39:59

[we'll be looking at in deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m02s)
00:40:02

[course which basically shows what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m04s)
00:40:04

[happens when we use something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m06s)
00:40:06

[stochastic gradient descent to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m07s)
00:40:07

[set a and B and basically what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m10s)
00:40:10

[is we're going to pick a random a to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m12s)
00:40:12

[start with a random B to start with and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m14s)
00:40:14

[then we're going to basically figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m17s)
00:40:17

[do I need to increase or decrease a to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m19s)
00:40:19

[make it closer at the line closer to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m23s)
00:40:23

[dots do I need to increase or decrease B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m25s)
00:40:25

[to make the line closer to the dots and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m27s)
00:40:27

[then just keep increasing and decreasing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[a and B lots and lots of times okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m31s)
00:40:31

[that's what we're going to do and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m34s)
00:40:34

[to answer the question do I need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[increase or decrease a and B we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m37s)
00:40:37

[to take the derivative right so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m39s)
00:40:39

[derivative of the function with respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m41s)
00:40:41

[to a and B tells us how will that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m44s)
00:40:44

[function change as we change a and B all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[right so that's basically what we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m49s)
00:40:49

[going to do but we're not going to start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m50s)
00:40:50

[with just a line the idea is we're to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m52s)
00:40:52

[build up to actually having a neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m56s)
00:40:56

[and so it's going to be exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h40m58s)
00:40:58

[idea but because it's an infinitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m00s)
00:41:00

[flexible function we're going to be able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m02s)
00:41:02

[to use this exact same technique to fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m04s)
00:41:04

[arbitrarily to arbitrarily complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m07s)
00:41:07

[relationships now that's basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m09s)
00:41:09

[idea so then what you need to know is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m12s)
00:41:12

[that a neural net is actually a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m15s)
00:41:15

[simple thing a neural net actually is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m19s)
00:41:19

[something which takes as input let's say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m22s)
00:41:22

[we've got a vector does a matrix product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m30s)
00:41:30

[by that vector right so this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m36s)
00:41:36

[this is of size let's draw this properly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m39s)
00:41:39

[so like if this is sighs ah this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[our bye see a matrix product will spit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m46s)
00:41:46

[out something of size C all right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m49s)
00:41:49

[then we do something called a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m56s)
00:41:56

[non-linearity which is basically we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m58s)
00:41:58

[going to throw away all the negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h41m59s)
00:41:59

[values so can so it's basically max zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m01s)
00:42:01

[comma X and then we're going to put that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m04s)
00:42:04

[through another matrix multiply and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m07s)
00:42:07

[we're going to put that through another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m10s)
00:42:10

[max zero comma X and we're going to put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m12s)
00:42:12

[that through another matrix multiply and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m15s)
00:42:15

[so on right until eventually we end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m17s)
00:42:17

[with the single vector that we want so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m20s)
00:42:20

[in other words each stage of our neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m24s)
00:42:24

[network is the key thing going on is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m26s)
00:42:26

[matrix multiplied so in other words a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m30s)
00:42:30

[linear function so basically deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[learning most of their calculation is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[lots and lots of linear functions but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m38s)
00:42:38

[between each one we're going to replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m41s)
00:42:41

[the negative numbers with zeros can you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m44s)
00:42:44

[yes so why are we throwing away the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m51s)
00:42:51

[negative numbers well we'll see right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m55s)
00:42:55

[the short answer is if you apply a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h42m59s)
00:42:59

[linear function to a linear function to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m01s)
00:43:01

[a linear function it's still just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m03s)
00:43:03

[linear function so it's totally useless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m05s)
00:43:05

[but if you throw away the negatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m08s)
00:43:08

[that's actually a nonlinear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[transformation and so it turns out that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m12s)
00:43:12

[if you apply a linear function to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m14s)
00:43:14

[thing we threw away the negatives that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m18s)
00:43:18

[applies that to a linear function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m19s)
00:43:19

[creates a neural network and it turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m21s)
00:43:21

[out that's the thing that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m23s)
00:43:23

[approximate any other function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[arbitrarily closely so this tiny little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m26s)
00:43:26

[difference actually makes all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h43m29s)

[started I remember when I first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h45m03s)
00:45:03

[suggested to Rachel she might think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h45m06s)
00:45:06

[about blogging because she had so much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h45m07s)

[speaking you should find people are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m00s)
00:47:00

[pretty supportive um besides which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m01s)
00:47:01

[there's lots and lots of data sets out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m04s)
00:47:04

[there available so even if you can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m06s)
00:47:06

[base it on the work you're doing you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m10s)
00:47:10

[find something similar for sure alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m12s)
00:47:12

[so we're going to start building our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m15s)
00:47:15

[neural network we're going to build it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m17s)
00:47:17

[using something called a torch PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m19s)
00:47:19

[is a library that basically looks a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m22s)
00:47:22

[like numpy but when you create some code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m26s)
00:47:26

[with PI torch you can run it on the GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m33s)
00:47:33

[rather than the CPU so the GPU is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m37s)
00:47:37

[something which is basically going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m43s)
00:47:43

[probably at least an order of magnitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m46s)
00:47:46

[possibly hundreds of times faster than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m49s)
00:47:49

[the code that you might write for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m52s)

[CPU for particularly stuff involving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m53s)
00:47:53

[lots of linear algebra right so with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m56s)

[deep learning neural nets you can if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h47m59s)
00:47:59

[if you don't have a GPU you can do it on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m03s)
00:48:03

[the CPU right but it's it's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[frustratingly slow your Mac does not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m08s)
00:48:08

[have a GPU that we can use for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m15s)
00:48:15

[because I'm actually talking today we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m18s)
00:48:18

[need an NVIDIA GPU I would actually much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m21s)
00:48:21

[prefer that we could use your Mac's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m26s)
00:48:26

[because competition is great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m27s)
00:48:27

[right but in video we're really the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m29s)
00:48:29

[first ones to create a GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m31s)
00:48:31

[which did a good job of supporting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m33s)

[general purpose graphics programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m34s)
00:48:34

[units GPGPU so in other words that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m37s)

[created a framework called CUDA see UDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m44s)
00:48:44

[it's it's a very good framework it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m48s)
00:48:48

[pretty much universally used in deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h48m51s)

[money to do deep learning so could you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m26s)
00:49:26

[please have yeah so you'll generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m30s)
00:49:30

[find a whole bunch of laptops with names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m35s)
00:49:35

[like predator and Viper with pictures of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m37s)

[robots and stuff so stealth pro Raider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m42s)
00:49:42

[leopard anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m49s)
00:49:49

[having said that like I don't know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[many people that do much deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[on their laptop most people will log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m56s)
00:49:56

[into a cloud environment by far the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h49m58s)
00:49:58

[easiest I know a few users called cresol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m01s)
00:50:01

[with Kressel you can basically sign up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m04s)
00:50:04

[and straightaway the first thing you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m08s)
00:50:08

[is a throne straight into a jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m10s)
00:50:10

[notebook backed by a GPU cost 60 cents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m13s)
00:50:13

[an hour with all of the fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m17s)
00:50:17

[libraries and data already available so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m19s)
00:50:19

[that makes life really easy it's less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[flexible and in some ways less fast then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m29s)
00:50:29

[using AWS which is the Amazon Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[Services option cost a little bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m36s)
00:50:36

[ninety cents an hour rather than 60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m40s)
00:50:40

[cents and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m42s)
00:50:42

[but it's very likely that your employer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m43s)
00:50:43

[is already using that it's like it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m47s)
00:50:47

[good to get to know anyway they've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m50s)
00:50:50

[more different choices around GPUs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[it's a good good choice if you're Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m55s)
00:50:55

[for github student pack if you're a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h50m57s)

[dollars of credits straight away pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m02s)
00:51:02

[much and so it's a really good way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m06s)
00:51:06

[get started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[Daniel did you have a question yeah I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m09s)
00:51:09

[just wanted to know your opinion on I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[know that until recently published like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m16s)
00:51:16

[an open source like way of like boosting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m19s)
00:51:19

[like regular packages that they claim is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m22s)
00:51:22

[equivalent like if you use the bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m25s)
00:51:25

[tier GPU on your seat like on your CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m27s)
00:51:27

[if you use their boost packages like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m30s)
00:51:30

[can get the same performance do you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m32s)
00:51:32

[anything about that yeah I do it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m35s)
00:51:35

[good question so I'm actually intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m37s)
00:51:37

[makes some great numerical programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m38s)
00:51:38

[libraries particularly this one called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m41s)
00:51:41

[mkl the matrix colonel library they they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m43s)
00:51:43

[definitely make things faster they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m49s)
00:51:49

[not using those libraries but if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m51s)
00:51:51

[look at a graph of performance over time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m53s)
00:51:53

[GPUs have consistently throughout the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m56s)
00:51:56

[last 10 years including now are about 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h51m59s)
00:51:59

[times more floating-point operations per](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m03s)
00:52:03

[second than the equivalent CPU and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m06s)
00:52:06

[they're generally about a fifth of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m09s)
00:52:09

[price for that performance so yeah it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m12s)
00:52:12

[and then because of that like everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m17s)
00:52:17

[doing anything with deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m21s)
00:52:21

[basically does it on NVIDIA GPUs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m23s)
00:52:23

[therefore using anything other than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m26s)
00:52:26

[NVIDIA GPUs is currently very annoying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m27s)
00:52:27

[so slower more expensive more annoying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m31s)
00:52:31

[I really hope there will be more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m33s)
00:52:33

[activity around AMD GPUs in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m35s)
00:52:35

[in this area but AMD's got like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m38s)
00:52:38

[literally years of catching up to do so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m40s)
00:52:40

[it might take a while yeah so I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m43s)
00:52:43

[wanted to point out that you can also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m46s)
00:52:46

[buy at things such as like a GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m48s)
00:52:48

[extender to a laptop yeah that's also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m50s)
00:52:50

[like kind of making like maybe a first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m52s)
00:52:52

[step solution if you only really want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m54s)
00:52:54

[yeah yeah I think for like 300 bucks or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m56s)
00:52:56

[so you can buy something that plugs into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h52m59s)
00:52:59

[your Thunderbolt port if you have a Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m01s)
00:53:01

[and then for another five or six hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m02s)
00:53:02

[bucks you can buy a GPU to plug into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m04s)
00:53:04

[that having said that for about a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m06s)
00:53:06

[thousand bucks you can actually create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m08s)
00:53:08

[pretty good you know GPU based desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[and so if you're considering that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[fast AI forums have like lots of threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m16s)
00:53:16

[where people help each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m19s)
00:53:19

[spec out something at a particular price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m20s)
00:53:20

[point anyway so to start with out so use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[cresol and then you know when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m25s)
00:53:25

[ready to invest a few extra minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m30s)
00:53:30

[getting going use AWS to use AWS you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m32s)
00:53:32

[basically huh yeah yeah yeah I'm just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m38s)
00:53:38

[talking to the folks online as well okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m46s)
00:53:46

[so so AWS when you get there go to ec2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h53m53s)
00:53:53

[ac2 like there's lots of stuff on AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m00s)
00:54:00

[ec2 is the bit where we get to like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m03s)
00:54:03

[rent computers by the hour right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m05s)
00:54:05

[we're gonna need a GPU based instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m08s)
00:54:08

[unfortunately when you first sign up for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m13s)
00:54:13

[AWS they don't give you access to them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m16s)
00:54:16

[so you have to request that access so go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m18s)
00:54:18

[to limits up in the top left right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m20s)
00:54:20

[the main GPU instance we'll be using is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m23s)
00:54:23

[called the p2 so scroll down to p2 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m27s)
00:54:27

[here P 2 dot X large you need to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m30s)
00:54:30

[sure that that numbers not 0 if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m34s)
00:54:34

[just got a new account it probably is 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m36s)
00:54:36

[which means you won't be allowed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m38s)
00:54:38

[create one you have to go request limit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m39s)
00:54:39

[increase and the trick there is when it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m41s)
00:54:41

[asks you why do you want the limit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m45s)
00:54:45

[increase type faster AI because AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m46s)
00:54:46

[knows to look out and they know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m50s)
00:54:50

[faster day I people are good people so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m52s)
00:54:52

[they'll do it quite quickly that takes a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m54s)
00:54:54

[day or two generally speaking to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m57s)
00:54:57

[through so once you get the email saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h54m59s)
00:54:59

[you've been approved for p2 instances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m02s)
00:55:02

[you can then go back here and say launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m04s)
00:55:04

[instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m07s)
00:55:07

[and so we've basically set up one that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m09s)
00:55:09

[has everything you need so if you click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m12s)
00:55:12

[on community ama and ami is an Amazon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m14s)
00:55:14

[machine image it's basically a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m17s)
00:55:17

[completely set up computer right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m19s)
00:55:19

[if you type fast AI or one word you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m23s)
00:55:23

[find here fast AI do part one version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m27s)
00:55:27

[two for the p2 right so that's all set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m30s)
00:55:30

[up ready to go so if you click on select](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m33s)
00:55:33

[and it'll say okay what kind of computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m37s)
00:55:37

[do you want right and so we have to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m40s)
00:55:40

[all right I want a GPU compute type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m42s)
00:55:42

[and specifically I want to pee to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m47s)
00:55:47

[extra-large right and then you can say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[review and launch I'm assuming you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[already know how to deal with SSH keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m55s)
00:55:55

[and all that kind of stuff if you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m57s)
00:55:57

[check out the introductory tutorials and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h55m59s)
00:55:59

[workshop videos that we have online or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m02s)
00:56:02

[Google around for SSH keys very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m05s)
00:56:05

[important skill to know anyway all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m09s)
00:56:09

[so hopefully you get through all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m12s)
00:56:12

[you have something running on a GPU with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m15s)
00:56:15

[the past AI repo if you use cresol just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m19s)
00:56:19

[CD fast AI to the the repo is already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m22s)
00:56:22

[there get Paul AWS CD fast AI the repo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m25s)
00:56:25

[is already there get Paul if it's your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m30s)
00:56:30

[own computer you'll just have to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m33s)
00:56:33

[clone and then away you go all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m35s)
00:56:35

[so part of all of those is PI torch is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m38s)
00:56:38

[pre-installed and so PI torch basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m42s)
00:56:42

[means we can write code that looks a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m45s)
00:56:45

[like numpy but it's going to run really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m46s)
00:56:46

[quickly on the GPU secondly since we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m49s)
00:56:49

[need to know like which direction and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m54s)
00:56:54

[how much to move our parameters to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m56s)
00:56:56

[improve our loss we need to know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h56m58s)
00:56:58

[derivative of functions PI torch has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m01s)
00:57:01

[this amazing thing where any code you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m03s)
00:57:03

[write using the PI torch library it can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m07s)
00:57:07

[automatically take the derivative of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m09s)
00:57:09

[that for you so we're not going to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m11s)
00:57:11

[at any capitalist in this course and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m13s)
00:57:13

[don't look at any calculus in any of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m16s)
00:57:16

[courses or at any of my work basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m17s)
00:57:17

[ever in terms of like actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m19s)
00:57:19

[calculating derivatives myself because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m21s)
00:57:21

[I've never had to it's done for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m24s)
00:57:24

[by the library so as long as you write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m27s)
00:57:27

[the Python code it's the derivative it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m29s)
00:57:29

[done so the only calculus you really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m31s)
00:57:31

[need to know to be an effective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m33s)
00:57:33

[practitioner is like what is it what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m35s)
00:57:35

[does it mean to be a derivative and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m37s)
00:57:37

[also need to know the chain rule which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m40s)
00:57:40

[will come - all right so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m41s)
00:57:41

[start out kind of top-down create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m47s)
00:57:47

[neural net and we're going to assume a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m50s)
00:57:50

[whole bunch of stuff and gradually we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[going to dig into each piece right so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m53s)
00:57:53

[create neural Nets we need to import the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m57s)
00:57:57

[PI torch neural net library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h57m59s)
00:57:59

[hi torch funnily enough is not called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m01s)
00:58:01

[play torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m04s)
00:58:04

[it's called torch okay so torch NN is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m05s)
00:58:05

[the PI torch subsection that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m08s)
00:58:08

[responsible for neural nets okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m12s)
00:58:12

[we'll call that n N and then we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m14s)
00:58:14

[to import a few bits out of fast AI just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m16s)
00:58:16

[to make life a bit easier for us so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m18s)
00:58:18

[here's how you create a neural network n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m21s)
00:58:21

[PI torch by the simplest possible neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m23s)
00:58:23

[network you say sequential and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m27s)
00:58:27

[sequential means I am now going to give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m30s)
00:58:30

[you a list of the layers that I want in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m32s)
00:58:32

[my neural network right so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m34s)
00:58:34

[my list has two things in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m38s)
00:58:38

[the first thing says I want a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m40s)
00:58:40

[layer now a linear layer is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m43s)
00:58:43

[that's basically going to do y equals ax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m46s)
00:58:46

[plus B right but matrix matrix multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m47s)
00:58:47

[not not univariate obviously so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m53s)
00:58:53

[going to do a matrix product basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h58m57s)
00:58:57

[so the input of the matrix product is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m00s)
00:59:00

[going to be a vector of length 28 times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m02s)
00:59:02

[28 because that's how many pixels we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m05s)
00:59:05

[have and the output needs to be of size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m08s)
00:59:08

[10 we'll talk about why in a moment but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m11s)
00:59:11

[for now you know this is how we define a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m14s)
00:59:14

[linear layer and then again we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m16s)
00:59:16

[to dig into this in detail but every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[linear layer just about in neural nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m20s)
00:59:20

[has to have a non-linearity after it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m23s)
00:59:23

[then we're going to learn about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m25s)
00:59:25

[particular non-linearity in a moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m26s)
00:59:26

[it's called the softmax and if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[done the DL course you've already seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m30s)
00:59:30

[this so that's how we define a neuron it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m31s)
00:59:31

[this is a two layer neural net there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m34s)
00:59:34

[also kind of an implicit additional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m37s)
00:59:37

[first layer which is the input but with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m39s)
00:59:39

[PI torch you don't have to explicitly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m42s)
00:59:42

[mention the input that normally we think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m44s)
00:59:44

[conceptually like the input image is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m46s)
00:59:46

[kind of also a layer because we're kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m49s)
00:59:49

[of doing things pretty manually with PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m54s)
00:59:54

[torch we're not taking advantage of any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m57s)
00:59:57

[of their convenience is in fast AI for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=00h59m58s)
00:59:58

[building your stuff we have to then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m01s)
01:00:01

[write CUDA which tells PI torch to copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m03s)
01:00:03

[this neural network across to the GPU so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m06s)
01:00:06

[now on from now on that network is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m09s)
01:00:09

[to be actually running on the GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m12s)
01:00:12

[we didn't say that it would run on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m14s)
01:00:14

[CPU so that gives us back a neuron it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m16s)
01:00:16

[very simple neural net so we're then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m20s)
01:00:20

[going to try and fit the neural net to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m24s)
01:00:24

[some data so we need some data so first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[AI has this concept of a model data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m30s)
01:00:30

[object which is basically something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m32s)
01:00:32

[wraps up training data validation data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m35s)
01:00:35

[and optionally test data and so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m38s)
01:00:38

[create a model data object you can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m40s)
01:00:40

[say I want to create some image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m44s)
01:00:44

[classifier data I'm going to grab it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m45s)
01:00:45

[from some arrays right and you just say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m47s)
01:00:47

[ok this is the path then I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m50s)
01:00:50

[save any temporary files this is my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m52s)
01:00:52

[training data arrays and this is my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m54s)
01:00:54

[validation data arrays ok and so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h00m58s)
01:00:58

[just returns an object that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m01s)
01:01:01

[wrap that all up and so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m03s)
01:01:03

[be able to fit to that data so now that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m05s)
01:01:05

[we have a neural net and we have some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m07s)
01:01:07

[data we're going to come back to this in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m10s)
01:01:10

[a moment but we basically say what loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m12s)
01:01:12

[function do we want to use what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m14s)
01:01:14

[optimizer do we want to use and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m15s)
01:01:15

[say fit we say fit this network to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m18s)
01:01:18

[data going over every image once using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m24s)
01:01:24

[this loss function this optimizer and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m28s)
01:01:28

[print out these metrics bang ok and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m32s)
01:01:32

[says here this is 91.8% accurate ok so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m35s)
01:01:35

[that's like the simplest possible neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m40s)
01:01:40

[it so what that's doing is it's creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m42s)
01:01:42

[a matrix multiplication followed by a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m47s)
01:01:47

[non-linearity and that it's trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m52s)
01:01:52

[find the values for this matrix which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h01m55s)
01:01:55

[cause which basically that fit the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m00s)
01:02:00

[as well as possible that a product that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m02s)
01:02:02

[end up predicting this is a 1 this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m04s)
01:02:04

[9s is a 3 and so we need some definition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m07s)
01:02:07

[for as well as possible and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m10s)
01:02:10

[general term for that thing is called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m12s)
01:02:12

[the loss function so the loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m14s)
01:02:14

[is the function that's going to be lower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m17s)
01:02:17

[if this is better right just like with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m19s)
01:02:19

[random forests we had this concept of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m22s)
01:02:22

[information gain and we got to like pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m24s)
01:02:24

[what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m26s)
01:02:26

[function do you want to use to define](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m27s)
01:02:27

[information gain and we were mainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m29s)
01:02:29

[looking at root mean square error right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m31s)
01:02:31

[most machine learning algorithms recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m34s)
01:02:34

[something very similar to at loss right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m37s)
01:02:37

[so the loss is how do we score how good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m39s)
01:02:39

[we are and so in the end we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m42s)
01:02:42

[calculate the derivative of the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m44s)
01:02:44

[with respect to the weight matrix that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m46s)
01:02:46

[we're multiplying by to figure out how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m50s)
01:02:50

[to how to update it right so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m52s)
01:02:52

[to use something called negative log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m55s)
01:02:55

[likelihood loss so negative log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[likelihood loss is also known as cross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m00s)
01:03:00

[entropy they're literally the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m04s)
01:03:04

[there's two versions one called binary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m06s)
01:03:06

[cross entropy or binary negative log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[likelihood and another court categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m13s)
01:03:13

[cross entropy the same thing one is for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m15s)
01:03:15

[when you've only got a zero or one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m18s)
01:03:18

[dependent the other is if you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[like cat dog airplane or horse or at 0 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m22s)
01:03:22

[through 9 and so forth so what we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m26s)
01:03:26

[here is the binary version of cross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m29s)
01:03:29

[entropy and so here is the definition I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m33s)
01:03:33

[think maybe the easiest way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m37s)
01:03:37

[understand this definition is to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m38s)
01:03:38

[an example so let's say we're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m40s)
01:03:40

[protect cat versus dog one is cat zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m43s)
01:03:43

[is dog so here we've got cat dog dog cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[and here are our predictions we said 90%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[sure it's a cat 90% sure it's a dog 80%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h03m56s)
01:03:56

[sure it's a dog 80% sure it's a cat all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m03s)
01:04:03

[right so we can then calculate the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m06s)
01:04:06

[binary cross entropy by calling our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m09s)
01:04:09

[function so it's going to say okay for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m12s)
01:04:12

[the first one we've got y equals 1 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m13s)
01:04:13

[it's going to be 1 times log of 0.9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m17s)
01:04:17

[plus 1 minus y 1 minus 1 is 0 so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m23s)
01:04:23

[going to be skipped okay and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[second one is going to be a 0 so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[going to be 0 times something so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m33s)
01:04:33

[going to be skipped and the second part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m35s)
01:04:35

[will be 1 minus 0 ah so this is 1 times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m38s)
01:04:38

[log of 1 minus p1 minus point 1 is point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m42s)
01:04:42

[9 so in other words the first piece and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m47s)
01:04:47

[the second piece of this are going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m51s)
01:04:51

[give exactly the same number which makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m53s)
01:04:53

[sense because the first one we said we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m55s)
01:04:55

[were 90% confident it was a cat and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h04m57s)
01:04:57

[was and the second we said we were 90%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m01s)
01:05:01

[confident it was a dog and it was so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m03s)
01:05:03

[each case the loss is coming from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m06s)
01:05:06

[fact that you know we could have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m09s)
01:05:09

[more confident yeah so if we said we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m11s)
01:05:11

[a hundred percent confident the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m13s)
01:05:13

[would have been zero right so let's look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m15s)
01:05:15

[at that in Excel so here's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m18s)
01:05:18

[Oh point nine point one point two point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m25s)
01:05:25

[eight right and here's our predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m29s)
01:05:29

[101 so here's one minus the prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m31s)
01:05:31

[right here is log of our prediction here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m34s)
01:05:34

[is log of one minus our prediction and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m39s)
01:05:39

[so then here is our sum okay so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m45s)
01:05:45

[think about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[and I want you to think about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m52s)
01:05:52

[during the week you could replace this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m54s)
01:05:54

[with an if statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h05m58s)
01:05:58

[rather than Y because Y is always 1 or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m00s)
01:06:00

[zero right then it's only ever going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m04s)
01:06:04

[use either this or this so you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m06s)
01:06:06

[replace this with an if statement so I'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m09s)
01:06:09

[like you during the week to try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m11s)
01:06:11

[rewrite this with an if statement okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m13s)
01:06:13

[and then see if you can then scale it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m17s)
01:06:17

[out to be a categorical cross-entropy so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m21s)
01:06:21

[categorical cross-entropy works this way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m24s)
01:06:24

[let's say we were trying to predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m27s)
01:06:27

[three and then six and then seven and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m28s)
01:06:28

[then two so if we were trying to predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m31s)
01:06:31

[three and the actual thing that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[predicted was like four point seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[right versus like well actually putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m39s)
01:06:39

[it this way we're trying predict three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m43s)
01:06:43

[and we actually predicted five or a try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m44s)
01:06:44

[to predict three and we accidentally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m47s)
01:06:47

[predicted nine like Bing five instead of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m48s)
01:06:48

[three is no better than being mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m52s)
01:06:52

[instead of three so we're not actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m54s)
01:06:54

[going to say like how far away is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m56s)
01:06:56

[actual number we're going to express it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h06m59s)
01:06:59

[differently or to put it another way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m00s)
01:07:00

[what if we're trying to predict cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m03s)
01:07:03

[dogs horses and airplanes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m04s)
01:07:04

[you can't like how far away is cat from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m06s)
01:07:06

[horse so we're going to express these a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[little bit differently rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m11s)
01:07:11

[thinking of it as a three let's think of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m13s)
01:07:13

[it as a vector with a 1 in the third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m15s)
01:07:15

[location and rather than thinking it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m20s)
01:07:20

[a six let's think of it as a vector of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m23s)
01:07:23

[zeros for the one in the sixth location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m25s)
01:07:25

[so in other words one hot encoding right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m28s)
01:07:28

[so that's one hot in code a dependent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m30s)
01:07:30

[variable and so that way now rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m33s)
01:07:33

[predicting trying to predict a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m36s)
01:07:36

[number let's predict ten numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m38s)
01:07:38

[alright let's predict what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m42s)
01:07:42

[probability that it's a zero what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m44s)
01:07:44

[probability it's a 1 what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m46s)
01:07:46

[probability it's a 2 and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m48s)
01:07:48

[alright and so let's say we're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m50s)
01:07:50

[predict the two right then here is our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m52s)
01:07:52

[binary cross-entropy sorry categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m57s)
01:07:57

[cross-entropy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[so it's just saying okay did this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m00s)
01:08:00

[predict correctly or not how far off was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m03s)
01:08:03

[it and so forth for each one all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m05s)
01:08:05

[and so add them all up so categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m09s)
01:08:09

[cross-entropy is identical to binary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m11s)
01:08:11

[cross-entropy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m13s)
01:08:13

[we just have to add it up across all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m14s)
01:08:14

[the categories so try and turn the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m16s)
01:08:16

[binary cross-entropy function in python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m21s)
01:08:21

[into a categorical cross-entropy python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m24s)
01:08:24

[and maybe create both the version with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[the if statement and the version with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m27s)
01:08:27

[the sum and the product alright alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m29s)
01:08:29

[so that's why in our PI torch we had 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m35s)
01:08:35

[as the output as the put dimensionality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m42s)
01:08:42

[for this matrix because when we multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m45s)
01:08:45

[sup by a matrix with 10 columns we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m47s)
01:08:47

[going to end up with something of length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m52s)
01:08:52

[10 which is what we want we want to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m53s)
01:08:53

[10 predictions ok so so that's the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h08m56s)
01:08:56

[function that we're using all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m04s)
01:09:04

[then we can fit the model and what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m09s)
01:09:09

[does is it goes through every image this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m12s)
01:09:12

[many times so in this case it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m17s)
01:09:17

[looking at every image once and go into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[slightly update the values in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m21s)
01:09:21

[weight matrix based on those gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m24s)
01:09:24

[and so once we've trained it we can then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m27s)
01:09:27

[say predict using this model on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m31s)
01:09:31

[validation set right and now that spits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m37s)
01:09:37

[out something of 10,000 by 10 consumers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m40s)
01:09:40

[Elmi why is this shape these predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m45s)
01:09:45

[why are they have shaked 10,000 by 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m48s)
01:09:48

[don't fret Chris it's right next to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m53s)
01:09:53

[well it's because we have 10,000 images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h09m56s)
01:09:56

[we're training up 10,000 images training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m00s)
01:10:00

[on so that's what we're validating on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m03s)
01:10:03

[north coast but it's the same thing so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m05s)
01:10:05

[10,000 be validating on so that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m06s)
01:10:06

[first axis as percent the second axis is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m08s)
01:10:08

[because we actually make 10 predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m11s)
01:10:11

[per image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[good good exactly so each one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m13s)
01:10:13

[rows is the probabilities that it's Anor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m15s)
01:10:15

[that it's a one that isn't true that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m18s)
01:10:18

[three and so forth okay very good so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m19s)
01:10:19

[math there's a really common operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m24s)
01:10:24

[we do called Arg max notice though it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m28s)
01:10:28

[common it's funny you like at high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m30s)
01:10:30

[school I never saw odd max first year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m33s)
01:10:33

[undergrad I never saw Arg max but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m37s)
01:10:37

[somehow after university everything's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m39s)
01:10:39

[about Arg max so one of these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m42s)
01:10:42

[that's for some reason not really taught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m44s)
01:10:44

[at school but it actually turns out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m45s)
01:10:45

[be super critical and so odd max is both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m47s)
01:10:47

[something that you'll see in math and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m49s)
01:10:49

[it's just written out in full Arg max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m50s)
01:10:50

[it's in numpy it's in PI torch it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m54s)
01:10:54

[super important and what it does is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h10m57s)
01:10:57

[says let's take this array of creds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m00s)
01:11:00

[right and let's figure out on this axis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m03s)
01:11:03

[remember access one is columns right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m06s)
01:11:06

[across as Chris said the 10 predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m09s)
01:11:09

[for each one for each row let's find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m11s)
01:11:11

[which prediction has the highest value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[and return not that if it does hit max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m16s)
01:11:16

[it would return the value Arg max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[returns the index with their value all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m21s)
01:11:21

[right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m25s)
01:11:25

[so by saying arc max Axess equals 1 it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m25s)
01:11:25

[going to return the index which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m28s)
01:11:28

[actually the number itself right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m32s)
01:11:32

[let's grab the first 5 okay so for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m33s)
01:11:33

[first one it thinks is a 3 then it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m36s)
01:11:36

[thinks six one's an eight next one's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m38s)
01:11:38

[six the next one's a nine next one's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m40s)
01:11:40

[six again okay so that's how we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[convert our probabilities back into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m44s)
01:11:44

[predictions all right so if we I'm safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m48s)
01:11:48

[that away call it Preds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m52s)
01:11:52

[we can then say okay when does Preds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m53s)
01:11:53

[equal the ground truth right so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h11m56s)
01:11:56

[going to return an array of balls which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m00s)
01:12:00

[we can treat as ones and zeros and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m03s)
01:12:03

[mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m06s)
01:12:06

[of a bunch of ones and zeroes is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m06s)
01:12:06

[the average so that gives us the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m09s)
01:12:09

[accuracy so there's our 91.8% and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m11s)
01:12:11

[want to be able to like replicate the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m15s)
01:12:15

[numbers you see and here it is there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m17s)
01:12:17

[our 91.8% all right so when we train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m19s)
01:12:19

[this it tells us the last thing it tells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m22s)
01:12:22

[us is whatever metric we asked for and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m24s)
01:12:24

[we asked for accuracy okay so the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m27s)
01:12:27

[thing it tells us is our metric which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m33s)
01:12:33

[accuracy and then before that we get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m34s)
01:12:34

[training set loss and the loss is again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m36s)
01:12:36

[whatever odds we asked for negative log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m39s)
01:12:39

[likelihood and the second thing is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m42s)
01:12:42

[validation set loss PI torch doesn't use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m43s)
01:12:43

[the word loss they use the word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m47s)
01:12:47

[criterion so you'll see here crit okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m49s)
01:12:49

[so that's criterion equals loss this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m52s)
01:12:52

[what loss function do we want to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m55s)
01:12:55

[they call that the criterion same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m56s)
01:12:56

[okay so here's how we can recreate that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h12m59s)
01:12:59

[accuracy so now we can go ahead and plot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m05s)
01:13:05

[eight of the images along with their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m11s)
01:13:11

[predictions and we've got three eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m14s)
01:13:14

[six nine Oh wrong five wrong okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m16s)
01:13:16

[you can see like why they are wrong like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m21s)
01:13:21

[this is pretty close to a nine it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m23s)
01:13:23

[missing a little cross at the top this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m25s)
01:13:25

[is pretty close to a five it's got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m28s)
01:13:28

[little bit at the extra here right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m30s)
01:13:30

[we've made a start and and all we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m32s)
01:13:32

[done so far is we haven't actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m35s)
01:13:35

[created a deep neural net we've actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m37s)
01:13:37

[got only one layer so what we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m40s)
01:13:40

[actually done is we've created a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m42s)
01:13:42

[logistic regression okay so a logistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m44s)
01:13:44

[regression is is literally what we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[built and you could try and replicate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m49s)
01:13:49

[this with SK learns logistic regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m51s)
01:13:51

[package when I did it I got similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m54s)
01:13:54

[accuracy but this version ran much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[faster because this is running on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m01s)
01:14:01

[GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[where else SK learn runs on the CPU okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m03s)
01:14:03

[so even for something like logistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m07s)
01:14:07

[regression we can you know implement it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m09s)
01:14:09

[very quickly with PI torch actually pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m11s)
01:14:11

[that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m13s)
01:14:13

[so when we're when we're creating our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m15s)
01:14:15

[net we have to do dot CUDA what would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m18s)
01:14:18

[the consequence of not doing that what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m22s)
01:14:22

[it does not run it wouldn't run quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m24s)
01:14:24

[yeah it'll run on the CPU can you pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m27s)
01:14:27

[it to jail so may build up your network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m31s)
01:14:31

[why is that we have to do linear and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m37s)
01:14:37

[followed by a nonlinear so the short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m40s)
01:14:40

[answer is because that's what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m47s)
01:14:47

[universal approximation theorem says is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m48s)
01:14:48

[the structure which can give you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m50s)
01:14:50

[arbitrarily accurate functions for any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m53s)
01:14:53

[functional form you know so the long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m56s)
01:14:56

[answer is the details of why the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h14m58s)
01:14:58

[universal approximation theorem works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m01s)
01:15:01

[another version of the short answer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m03s)
01:15:03

[that's the definition of a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m05s)
01:15:05

[network so the definition of a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m07s)
01:15:07

[network is a linear layer followed by a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m09s)
01:15:09

[activation function followed by a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m12s)
01:15:12

[layer followed by an activation function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m14s)
01:15:14

[etc we go into a lot more detail of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m16s)
01:15:16

[in the deep learning of course but you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[know for this purpose it's it's enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m23s)
01:15:23

[to know like that it works so far of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m25s)
01:15:25

[course we haven't actually built a deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m29s)
01:15:29

[neural net at all we've just built a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m31s)
01:15:31

[logistic regression and so at this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m33s)
01:15:33

[if you think about it all we're doing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m36s)
01:15:36

[we're taking every input pixel and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m38s)
01:15:38

[multiplying it by a weight for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m40s)
01:15:40

[possible outcome right so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m43s)
01:15:43

[basically saying you know on average the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m45s)
01:15:45

[number one you know has these pixels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m48s)
01:15:48

[turned on the number two has these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m51s)
01:15:51

[pixels turned on and that's why it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m52s)
01:15:52

[terribly accurate right that's that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[not how digit recognition works in real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h15m56s)
01:15:56

[life but that's that's always built so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m00s)
01:16:00

[far ok can you pass that to Devon so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m03s)
01:16:03

[keep saying this Universal approximation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m07s)
01:16:07

[theorem yeah did you define yeah but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m09s)
01:16:09

[let's cover it again because it's worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m14s)
01:16:14

[talking about so all right so Michael](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m16s)
01:16:16

[Nielsen has this great website called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m24s)
01:16:24

[neural networks and deep learning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m26s)
01:16:26

[his chapter 4 is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[actually kind of famous now and in it he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m29s)
01:16:29

[does this walkthrough of basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m32s)
01:16:32

[showing that a neural network can can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m35s)
01:16:35

[approximate any other function to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m42s)
01:16:42

[arbitrarily close accuracy as long as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m44s)
01:16:44

[it's big enough and we walk through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m49s)
01:16:49

[in a lot of detail in the deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m51s)
01:16:51

[course but the basic trick is that he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m54s)
01:16:54

[shows that with a few different numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h16m57s)
01:16:57

[you can basically kind of cause these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m01s)
01:17:01

[things to kind of create little boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m03s)
01:17:03

[you can move the boxes up and down you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m06s)
01:17:06

[can move them around you can join them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m07s)
01:17:07

[together to eventually basically create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m09s)
01:17:09

[like connections of towers which you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m12s)
01:17:12

[like use to approximate any kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m14s)
01:17:14

[surface right so that's you know that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[basically the trick and so all we need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m20s)
01:17:20

[to do given given that is to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m25s)
01:17:25

[find the parameters for each of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m29s)
01:17:29

[linear functions in that neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m31s)
01:17:31

[so to find the weights in each of the in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[each of the matrices and so so far we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m37s)
01:17:37

[got just one matrix and so we've just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m40s)
01:17:40

[built a simple logistic regression so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m43s)
01:17:43

[far just a small doubt I just want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m46s)
01:17:46

[confirm that when you showed images of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m52s)
01:17:52

[the examples of the images which were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[misclassified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[yeah they look rectangular so it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[that while rendering pixels are being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h17m58s)
01:17:58

[scale differently so are they still 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m01s)
01:18:01

[by 28 Square 20 hyper 20 I think it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m03s)
01:18:03

[square I think I just look like angular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m06s)
01:18:06

[cuz they've got titles on the top I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m07s)
01:18:07

[not sure yeah I don't know anyway they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m09s)
01:18:09

[are square and um like matplotlib yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m11s)
01:18:11

[it does often fiddle around with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m16s)
01:18:16

[know what it considers black versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m18s)
01:18:18

[white and you know having different size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m20s)
01:18:20

[axes and stuff so yeah you do have to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m22s)
01:18:22

[careful there sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m24s)
01:18:24

[um okay so hopefully this will now make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m29s)
01:18:29

[more sense because what we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m33s)
01:18:33

[do is like dig in a layer deeper and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m34s)
01:18:34

[define logistic regression without using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m36s)
01:18:36

[an n dot sequential without using an end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m40s)
01:18:40

[on linear without using an end log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m42s)
01:18:42

[softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m44s)
01:18:44

[so we're going to do nearly all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m45s)
01:18:45

[layer definition from scratch ok so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m49s)
01:18:49

[do that we're going to have to define a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m52s)
01:18:52

[PI torch module a PI torch module is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m55s)
01:18:55

[basically either a neural net or a layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h18m58s)
01:18:58

[in a neural net which is actually kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m00s)
01:19:00

[of a powerful concept of itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m03s)
01:19:03

[basically anything that can kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m05s)
01:19:05

[behave like a neural net can itself be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m07s)
01:19:07

[part of another neuron net and so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m09s)
01:19:09

[is like how we can construct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m11s)
01:19:11

[particularly powerful architectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m13s)
01:19:13

[combining lots of other pieces so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m15s)
01:19:15

[create a PI torch module just create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m19s)
01:19:19

[Python class but it has to inherit from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m22s)
01:19:22

[an end module so we haven't done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m25s)
01:19:25

[inheritance before other than that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m27s)
01:19:27

[is all the same concepts we've seen an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m31s)
01:19:31

[oo already basically if you put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m34s)
01:19:34

[something in parentheses here what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m37s)
01:19:37

[means is that our class gets all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m39s)
01:19:39

[functionality of this class for free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m41s)
01:19:41

[it's called sub classing it so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m44s)
01:19:44

[going to get all of the capabilities of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m47s)
01:19:47

[a neural network module that the PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m48s)
01:19:48

[torch authors have provided and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m51s)
01:19:51

[we're going to add additional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m53s)
01:19:53

[functionality to it when you create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m54s)
01:19:54

[sub class there is one key thing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h19m58s)
01:19:58

[need to remember to do which is when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m01s)
01:20:01

[initialize your class you have to first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m03s)
01:20:03

[of all initialize the superclass right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m05s)
01:20:05

[so the superclass is the NN module so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m09s)
01:20:09

[the NN module has to be built before you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m12s)
01:20:12

[can start adding your pieces to it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[so this is just like something you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m17s)
01:20:17

[copy and paste into every one of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m19s)
01:20:19

[modules you just say super dot in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m21s)
01:20:21

[this just means construct the superclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m24s)
01:20:24

[first ok so having done that we can now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m27s)
01:20:27

[go ahead and define our weights and our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m32s)
01:20:32

[bias so our weights is the weight matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m35s)
01:20:35

[is the actual matrix that we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m40s)
01:20:40

[multiply our data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m42s)
01:20:42

[by and as we discuss it's going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m43s)
01:20:43

[28 times 28 rows and 10 columns and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m45s)
01:20:45

[that's because if we take an image which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m51s)
01:20:51

[we flattened out into a 28 by 28 length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m54s)
01:20:54

[vector right then we can multiply it by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h20m57s)
01:20:57

[this weight matrix to get back out a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m01s)
01:21:01

[length 10 vector which we can then use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m04s)
01:21:04

[to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m08s)
01:21:08

[consider it as a set of predictions so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m11s)
01:21:11

[that's our weight matrix now the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m15s)
01:21:15

[is that we don't just want y equals ax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m19s)
01:21:19

[we want y equals ax plus B so the plus B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m22s)
01:21:22

[in neural nets is called bias and so as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m27s)
01:21:27

[well as defining weights we're also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[going to find bias and so since this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m32s)
01:21:32

[thing is going to spit out for every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m34s)
01:21:34

[image something of length 10 that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m37s)
01:21:37

[that we need to create a vector of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m40s)
01:21:40

[length 10 to be our biases in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m43s)
01:21:43

[words for everything naught 1 2 3 up to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m47s)
01:21:47

[mine we're going to have a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m49s)
01:21:49

[plus B that would be adding right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h21m51s)
01:21:51

[we've got our data matrix here which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m00s)
01:22:00

[of length 10,000 by 28 times 28 all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m06s)
01:22:06

[right and then we've got our weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m16s)
01:22:16

[which is 28 by 28 rose by 10 so if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m19s)
01:22:19

[multiply those together we get something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m26s)
01:22:26

[of size 10,000 by 10 okay and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m31s)
01:22:31

[want to add on our bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m38s)
01:22:38

[up run way around add on our bias okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m47s)
01:22:47

[like so and so when we add on and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m54s)
01:22:54

[going to learn a lot more about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m58s)
01:22:58

[later but when we add on a vector like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h22m59s)
01:22:59

[this it basically is going to get added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m03s)
01:23:03

[to every row okay so that bias is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m06s)
01:23:06

[to get added to every road so we first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m11s)
01:23:11

[of all define those and so to define](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m14s)
01:23:14

[them we've created a tiny little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m16s)
01:23:16

[function called get weights which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m18s)
01:23:18

[over here alright which basically just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m20s)
01:23:20

[creates some normally distributed random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m23s)
01:23:23

[numbers so a torch Rand n returns a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m25s)
01:23:25

[tensor filled with random numbers from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m28s)
01:23:28

[normal distribution we have to be a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m30s)
01:23:30

[careful though when we do deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m34s)
01:23:34

[like when we add more linear layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m37s)
01:23:37

[later imagine if we have a matrix which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m39s)
01:23:39

[on average tends to increase the size of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m44s)
01:23:44

[the inputs we give to it if we then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m47s)
01:23:47

[multiply it by lots of matrices of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m50s)
01:23:50

[size it's going to make the numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m53s)
01:23:53

[bigger and bigger and bigger like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m54s)
01:23:54

[exponentially bigger well what if it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m56s)
01:23:56

[made them a bit smaller it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h23m59s)
01:23:59

[make them smaller and smaller and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m01s)
01:24:01

[smaller exponentially smaller so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m02s)
01:24:02

[because a deep network applies lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m05s)
01:24:05

[linear layers if on average they result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m07s)
01:24:07

[in things a bit bigger than they started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m11s)
01:24:11

[with or a bit smaller than they started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m13s)
01:24:13

[with it's going to like exponentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m15s)
01:24:15

[multiply that difference so we need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m18s)
01:24:18

[make sure that the weight matrix is of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[an appropriate size that the inputs to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m24s)
01:24:24

[it they're kind of the mean of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m28s)
01:24:28

[inputs basically is not going to change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m29s)
01:24:29

[so it turns out that if you use normally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m32s)
01:24:32

[distributed random numbers and divided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m36s)
01:24:36

[by the number of rows in the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m38s)
01:24:38

[matrix it turns out that particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m42s)
01:24:42

[random initialization keeps your numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m45s)
01:24:45

[at about the right scale right so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m48s)
01:24:48

[idea that like if you've done linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m51s)
01:24:51

[algebra basically if the eigen value the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m54s)
01:24:54

[first eigenvalue is like bigger than one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m56s)
01:24:56

[or smaller than one it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h24m59s)
01:24:59

[cause the gradients to like get bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[and bigger or smaller and smaller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m03s)
01:25:03

[that's called gradient explosion right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m05s)
01:25:05

[so we'll talk more about this in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m07s)
01:25:07

[deep learning course but if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m10s)
01:25:10

[interested you can look at climbing her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m11s)
01:25:11

[initialization and read all about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m13s)
01:25:13

[concept right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m18s)
01:25:18

[but for now you know it's probably just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m19s)
01:25:19

[enough to know that if you use this type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m21s)
01:25:21

[of random number generation you're gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m25s)
01:25:25

[get random numbers that are and nicely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m27s)
01:25:27

[behaved you're going to start out with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m30s)
01:25:30

[an input which is mean 0 standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m32s)
01:25:32

[deviation 1 once you put it through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m34s)
01:25:34

[set of random numbers you'll still have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m37s)
01:25:37

[something that's about mean 0 standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m39s)
01:25:39

[deviation 1 that's basically the goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m41s)
01:25:41

[okay one nice thing about hi torch is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m43s)
01:25:43

[that you can play with this stuff right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m47s)
01:25:47

[so choice dot Randi and like try it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m49s)
01:25:49

[every time you see a function being used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m52s)
01:25:52

[run it go ahead and take a look and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m54s)
01:25:54

[you'll see it looks a lot like numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h25m57s)
01:25:57

[right but it doesn't return a numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m00s)
01:26:00

[array it returns a tensor and in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m02s)
01:26:02

[now I'm GPU programming okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m08s)
01:26:08

[like put CUDA and now it's doing it on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m11s)
01:26:11

[the GPU so like I just multiplied that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m13s)
01:26:13

[matrix by 3 very quickly on the GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m19s)
01:26:19

[right so that's how we do GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m21s)
01:26:21

[programming with pay torch all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m23s)
01:26:23

[this this is our weight matrix so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m29s)
01:26:29

[create as I said we create one pretty at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m31s)
01:26:31

[the 28 by 10 1 is just Rank 1 of 10 for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m32s)
01:26:32

[the biases we have to make them a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m37s)
01:26:37

[parameter this is basically telling PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[torch which things to update when it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m41s)
01:26:41

[does SGD that's very minor technical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m44s)
01:26:44

[detail so having created the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m48s)
01:26:48

[matrices we then define a special method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m50s)
01:26:50

[with the name forward this is a special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m53s)
01:26:53

[special meaning in pi torch a method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h26m59s)
01:26:59

[called forward in PI torch is the name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m02s)
01:27:02

[of the method that will get called when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m05s)
01:27:05

[your layer is calculated ok so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m07s)
01:27:07

[create a neural net or a layer you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m10s)
01:27:10

[to define](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m13s)
01:27:13

[forward and it's going to get past the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m14s)

[data from the previous layer so our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m18s)
01:27:18

[definition is to do a matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m20s)
01:27:20

[multiplication of our input data times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m22s)
01:27:22

[our weights and add on the biases so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m26s)
01:27:26

[that's it that's what happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m30s)
01:27:30

[earlier on when we said n n dot linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m32s)
01:27:32

[that created this this thing for us okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m34s)
01:27:34

[now unfortunately though we're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m41s)
01:27:41

[getting a 28 by 28 long vector we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m43s)
01:27:43

[getting a 28 row by 28 column matrix so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m47s)
01:27:47

[we have to flatten it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m51s)
01:27:51

[unfortunately in torch high torch they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m52s)
01:27:52

[tend to rename things they they spell re](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h27m55s)
01:27:55

[sigh reshape they spell it view okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m00s)
01:28:00

[view means reshape so you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m03s)
01:28:03

[we end up with something where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m05s)
01:28:05

[number of images we're going to leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m07s)
01:28:07

[the same and then we're going to replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m09s)

[negative one meaning as long as required](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m16s)
01:28:16

[okay so this is how we flatten something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m18s)
01:28:18

[using PI torch so we flatten it do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m22s)
01:28:22

[matrix multiply and then finally we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m25s)
01:28:25

[our soft maps so softmax is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m28s)
01:28:28

[activation function we use if you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m31s)
01:28:31

[in the deep learning repo you'll find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m35s)
01:28:35

[something called entropy example where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m38s)
01:28:38

[you'll see an example of softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m41s)
01:28:41

[but a soft Mac simply takes the outputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m43s)
01:28:43

[from our final layer so we get our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m45s)
01:28:45

[outputs from our from our linear layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m49s)
01:28:49

[and what we do is we go e ^ for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m51s)
01:28:51

[output and then we take that number and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m56s)
01:28:56

[we divide by the sum of the eight of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h28m59s)
01:28:59

[perils that's called softmax why do we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m03s)
01:29:03

[do that well because we're dividing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m06s)
01:29:06

[by the sum that means that the sum of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m09s)
01:29:09

[those itself must add to one right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m13s)
01:29:13

[that's what we want we want the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m17s)
01:29:17

[probabilities of all the possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m18s)
01:29:18

[outcomes add to one furthermore because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m20s)
01:29:20

[we're using e ^ that means we know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m24s)
01:29:24

[everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m27s)
01:29:27

[these is between zero and one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m27s)
01:29:27

[probabilities we know should be between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m29s)
01:29:29

[zero and one and then finally because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m31s)
01:29:31

[we're using e to the power of it tends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m36s)
01:29:36

[to mean that slightly bigger values in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m39s)
01:29:39

[the input turn into much bigger values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m42s)
01:29:42

[in the output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m45s)
01:29:45

[so you'll see generally speaking my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m46s)
01:29:46

[softmax there was going to be one big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m48s)
01:29:48

[number and lots of small numbers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m49s)
01:29:49

[that's what we want right because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m52s)
01:29:52

[know that the output is one hot encoded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m54s)
01:29:54

[so in other words a softmax activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h29m57s)
01:29:57

[function the softmax non-linearity is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m00s)
01:30:00

[something that returns things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m03s)
01:30:03

[behave like probabilities and where one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m06s)
01:30:06

[of those probabilities is more likely to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m09s)
01:30:09

[be kind of high and the other ones are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m11s)
01:30:11

[more likely to be low and we know that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m13s)
01:30:13

[what we want for a to map to our one hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m15s)
01:30:15

[encoding so a softmax is a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m18s)
01:30:18

[activation function to use to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m21s)
01:30:21

[help the neural net make it easier for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m23s)
01:30:23

[the neural net to to map to the output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m25s)
01:30:25

[that you wanted and this is what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m30s)
01:30:30

[generally want when we're kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m31s)
01:30:31

[designing neural networks we try to come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m32s)
01:30:32

[up with little architectural tweaks that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m35s)
01:30:35

[make it as easy for it as possible to to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m37s)
01:30:37

[to match the output that we know we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m40s)
01:30:40

[so that's basically it right like rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m44s)
01:30:44

[than doing sequential you know and using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m47s)
01:30:47

[an end linear and in dot softmax we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m50s)
01:30:50

[defined it from scratch we can now say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m52s)
01:30:52

[just like before our net is equal to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m55s)
01:30:55

[that plastic CUDA and we can say dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h30m57s)
01:30:57

[fetch and we get to within a slight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m00s)
01:31:00

[random deviation exactly the same output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m02s)
01:31:02

[okay so I'm what I'd like you to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m05s)
01:31:05

[during the week is to play around with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m08s)
01:31:08

[like torture and n to generate some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m10s)
01:31:10

[random tensors Torche drop map mole to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m12s)
01:31:12

[start multiplying them together adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m15s)
01:31:15

[them up try to make sure that you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m16s)
01:31:16

[rewrite softmax yourself from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m19s)
01:31:19

[you know like try to fiddle around a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m22s)
01:31:22

[with you know reshaping view or that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m24s)
01:31:24

[kind of stuff so that by the time you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m27s)
01:31:27

[come back next week you feel like pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m29s)
01:31:29

[comfortable with pi torch and if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m31s)
01:31:31

[google for pi torch tutorial you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m33s)
01:31:33

[there's a lot of great material actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m36s)
01:31:36

[on the PI torch website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m38s)
01:31:38

[to help you along basically showing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m41s)
01:31:41

[how to create tensors and modify them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m44s)
01:31:44

[and do operations on them all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m48s)
01:31:48

[great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m50s)
01:31:50

[yes you had a question can you pass it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m51s)
01:31:51

[over so I see that the forward is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m54s)
01:31:54

[layer that gets applied after each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h31m59s)
01:31:59

[the linear layers so not quite the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m01s)
01:32:01

[forward is just the definition of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m05s)
01:32:05

[module so this is like how it this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m07s)
01:32:07

[how we're implementing linear so does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m10s)
01:32:10

[that mean after each linear layer you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m12s)
01:32:12

[have to apply the same function let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m14s)
01:32:14

[say we can't do a log softmax after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m16s)
01:32:16

[layer one and then apply some other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m20s)
01:32:20

[function after layer two if we have like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m22s)
01:32:22

[a multi-layer neural network so normally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m24s)
01:32:24

[way to find neural networks normally we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m28s)
01:32:28

[define neural networks like so we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m37s)
01:32:37

[say here is a list of the layers we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m39s)
01:32:39

[wander right we don't you don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m41s)
01:32:41

[write your own forward right all we did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m44s)
01:32:44

[just now is to say like okay instead of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m47s)
01:32:47

[doing this let's not use any of this at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m50s)
01:32:50

[all but write it all by hand ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m52s)
01:32:52

[all right so you can you can write as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m55s)
01:32:55

[many layers you see like in what any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h32m59s)
01:32:59

[order you like here the point was that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m01s)
01:33:01

[here we're not using any of that we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m04s)
01:33:04

[written our own mat mole plus bias our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m07s)
01:33:07

[own softmax so this is like this is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m12s)
01:33:12

[is just Python code you can write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m16s)
01:33:16

[whatever Python code inside forward that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m17s)
01:33:17

[you like to define your own neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m21s)
01:33:21

[so like you you won't normally do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m24s)
01:33:24

[yourself normally you'll just use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m27s)
01:33:27

[layers that pie chart provides and your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m29s)
01:33:29

[use dot sequential to put them together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m31s)
01:33:31

[or even more likely your download or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m32s)
01:33:32

[predefined architecture and use that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m35s)
01:33:35

[we're just doing this to learn how it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzE0eSdy5Hk#t=01h33m37s)
01:33:37
