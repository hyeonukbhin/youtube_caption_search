hi everybody welcome to practical deep
00:00:00.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m00s

learning for coders this is part one of
00:00:03.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m03s

our two-part course I'm presenting this
00:00:06.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m06s

from the data Institute in San Francisco
00:00:11.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m11s

will be doing seven lessons in this part
00:00:15.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m15s

of the course most of them will be about
00:00:19.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m19s

a couple of hours long
00:00:21.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m21s

this first one may be a little bit
00:00:22.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m22s

shorter practical deep learning for
00:00:23.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m23s

coders is all about getting you up and
00:00:27.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m27s

running with deep learning in practice
00:00:30.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m30s

getting world-class results and it's a
00:00:32.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m32s

really coding focused approach as the
00:00:35.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m35s

name suggests but we're not going to
00:00:38.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m38s

dumb it down by the end of the course
00:00:39.629
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m39s

you all have learned all of the theory
00:00:41.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m41s

in details that are necessary to rebuild
00:00:44.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m44s

all of the world-class results we're
00:00:46.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m46s

learning about from scratch
00:00:48.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m48s

now I should mention that our videos are
00:00:50.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m50s

hosted on YouTube that we strongly
00:00:53.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m53s

recommend watching them via our website
00:00:56.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m56s

at course fast a I although they're
00:00:58.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h00m58s

exactly the same videos the important
00:01:02.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m02s

thing about watching them through our
00:01:05.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m05s

website is that you'll get all of the
00:01:07.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m07s

information you need about kind of
00:01:08.939
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m08s

updates to libraries my own locations
00:01:10.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m10s

further information frequently asked
00:01:14.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m14s

questions and so forth so if you're
00:01:16.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m16s

currently on YouTube watching this why
00:01:19.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m19s

don't you switch over to crosstalk fast
00:01:21.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m21s

at AI now and start watching through
00:01:23.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m23s

there and make sure you read all of the
00:01:25.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m25s

material on the page before you start
00:01:27.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m27s

just to make sure that you've got
00:01:29.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m29s

everything you need the other thing to
00:01:30.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m30s

mention is that there is a really great
00:01:34.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m34s

strong community at forums faster I from
00:01:36.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m36s

time to time you will find that you get
00:01:41.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m41s

stuck you may get stuck very early on
00:01:44.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m44s

you may not get stuck for quite a while
00:01:47.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m47s

but at some point you might get stuck
00:01:49.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m49s

with understanding why something works
00:01:50.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m50s

the way it does or there may be some
00:01:53.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m53s

computer problem that you have or so
00:01:55.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m55s

forth on forums don't fast at AI there
00:01:57.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h01m57s

are thousands of other learners talking
00:02:00.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m00s

about every lesson and lots of other
00:02:02.939
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m02s

topics besides it's the most active deep
00:02:05.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m05s

learning community on the internet by
00:02:07.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m07s

far so definitely register there
00:02:09.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m09s

and start getting involved you'll get a
00:02:12.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m12s

lot more out of this course if you do
00:02:14.939
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m14s

that so we're going to start by doing
00:02:16.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m16s

some coding this is an approach we're
00:02:22.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m22s

going to be talking about in the moment
00:02:24.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m24s

called the top-down approach to study
00:02:26.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m26s

but let's learn it by doing it so let's
00:02:29.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m29s

go ahead and try and actually train a
00:02:33.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m33s

neural network now in order to train a
00:02:35.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m35s

neural network you almost certainly want
00:02:38.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m38s

a GPU GPU of is a graphics processing a
00:02:41.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m41s

graphics processing unit it's the things
00:02:45.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m45s

that companies use to help you play
00:02:48.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m48s

games better they let your computer
00:02:52.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m52s

render the game much more quickly than
00:02:56.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m56s

your CPU okay we'll be talking about
00:02:58.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h02m58s

them more shortly but for now I'm going
00:03:01.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m01s

to show you how you can get access to a
00:03:04.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m04s

GPU specifically you're going to need an
00:03:06.689
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m06s

NVIDIA GPU because only NVIDIA GPUs
00:03:11.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m11s

support something called cooter cooter
00:03:14.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m14s

is the language and framework that
00:03:17.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m17s

nearly all deep learning libraries and
00:03:19.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m19s

practitioners use to do their work
00:03:22.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m22s

obviously it's not ideal that we're
00:03:26.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m26s

stuck with one particular vendors cards
00:03:28.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m28s

and over time we hope to see more
00:03:30.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m30s

competition in this base but for now we
00:03:32.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m32s

do need an NVIDIA GPU your laptop almost
00:03:34.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m34s

certainly doesn't have one unless you
00:03:38.459
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m38s

specifically went out of your way to buy
00:03:40.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m40s

like a gaming laptop so almost certainly
00:03:42.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m42s

you will need to rent one and the good
00:03:46.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m46s

news is that renting access paying by
00:03:50.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m50s

the second or a GPU based computer is
00:03:53.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m53s

pretty easy and pretty cheap I'm going
00:03:55.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m55s

to show you a couple of options the
00:03:59.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h03m59s

first option I'll show you which is
00:04:03.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m03s

probably the easiest is called Kressel
00:04:06.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m06s

if you go to kress allcom and click on
00:04:09.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m09s

sign up or if you've been there before
00:04:15.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m15s

sign-in you will find yourself at this
00:04:16.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m16s

screen which has a big button that says
00:04:19.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m19s

start jupiter and another switch called
00:04:22.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m22s

enable GP
00:04:24.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m24s

you so if we make sure that is set to
00:04:25.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m25s

true the Nabal GPU is on and we click
00:04:27.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m27s

start Jupiter and we click start Jupiter
00:04:30.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m30s

it's going to launch us into something
00:04:37.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m37s

called Jupiter notebook
00:04:39.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m39s

Jupiter notebook in a recent survey of
00:04:40.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m40s

tens of thousands of data scientists was
00:04:44.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m44s

rated as the third most important tool
00:04:46.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m46s

in the data scientist toolbox it's
00:04:48.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m48s

really important that you get to learn
00:04:51.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m51s

it well and all of our courses will be
00:04:52.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m52s

run through Jupiter yes Rachel you have
00:04:54.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m54s

a question or a comment I just wanted to
00:04:57.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m57s

point out that you get I believe 10 3
00:04:59.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h04m59s

hours so if you wanted to tricresyl out
00:05:01.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m01s

yeah he might have changed that recently
00:05:06.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m06s

to less hours but you can check the FAQ
00:05:10.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m10s

or the pricing but you certainly get
00:05:12.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m12s

some three hours the pricing varies
00:05:13.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m13s

because this is actually runs on top of
00:05:16.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m16s

Amazon Web Services so at the moment
00:05:18.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m18s

it's 60 cents an hour the nice thing is
00:05:19.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m19s

though that you can always turn it turn
00:05:24.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m24s

it on you know start your Jupiter
00:05:25.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m25s

without the CP without the GPU running
00:05:27.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m27s

and pay you a tenth of that price which
00:05:29.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m29s

is pretty cool
00:05:31.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m31s

so Jupiter notebook is something we'll
00:05:34.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m34s

be doing all of this course in and so to
00:05:36.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m36s

get started here we're going to find our
00:05:38.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m38s

particular course so we're go to courses
00:05:40.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m40s

and would go to fast a o2 and there they
00:05:42.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m42s

are things have been moving around a
00:05:48.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m48s

little bit so it may be in a different
00:05:51.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m51s

spot for you when you look at this and
00:05:52.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m52s

we'll make sure all the information
00:05:55.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m55s

current information is on the website
00:05:56.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m56s

now having said that that's you know the
00:05:59.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h05m59s

crystal approach is you know as you can
00:06:02.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m02s

see it's basically instant and and easy
00:06:05.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m05s

but if you've got you know an extra hour
00:06:08.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m08s

or so to get going and even better
00:06:13.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m13s

option is something called paper space
00:06:16.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m16s

paper space unlike Chris or doesn't run
00:06:22.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m22s

on top of Amazon they have their own
00:06:25.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m25s

machines
00:06:26.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m26s

and if I click on so here's here's paper
00:06:32.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m32s

space and so if I click on new machine I
00:06:36.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m36s

can pick which one of the three data
00:06:38.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m38s

centers to use so pick that one closest
00:06:41.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m41s

to you so I'll say a West Coast and then
00:06:43.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m43s

I'll say Linux and I'll say Ubuntu 16
00:06:47.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m47s

and then it says choose machine and you
00:06:51.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m51s

can see there's various different
00:06:54.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m54s

machines I can choose from and
00:06:55.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m55s

pay-by-the-hour so this is pretty cool
00:06:58.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h06m58s

for 40 cents an hour so it's cheaper
00:07:01.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m01s

than cresol I get a machine that's
00:07:04.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m04s

actually going to be much faster than
00:07:07.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m07s

Crescent 67 our machine or for 65 cents
00:07:09.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m09s

an hour way way way faster all right so
00:07:12.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m12s

I'm going to actually show you how to
00:07:15.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m15s

get started with the paper space
00:07:17.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m17s

approach because that actually is going
00:07:19.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m19s

to do everything from scratch you may
00:07:22.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m22s

find if you trailers
00:07:26.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m26s

do the 65 cents an hour one that it may
00:07:27.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m27s

require you to contact paper space to
00:07:30.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m30s

say like why do you want it and it's
00:07:32.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m32s

just an anti fraud the thing so if you
00:07:34.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m34s

say faster AI there then they'll quickly
00:07:36.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m36s

get you up and running so I'm going to
00:07:41.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m41s

use the cheapest one here 40 cents an
00:07:43.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m43s

hour you can pick how much draw it you
00:07:45.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m45s

want and note that you pay for a month
00:07:50.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m50s

of storage as soon as you start the
00:07:54.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m54s

machine up alright so don't start and
00:07:56.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m56s

stop lots of machines because each time
00:07:58.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m58s

you pay for that month of storage
00:07:59.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h07m59s

I think the 250 gig $7 a month option is
00:08:01.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m01s

pretty good but you only need 50 gig so
00:08:05.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m05s

if you're trying to minimize the price
00:08:07.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m07s

you can go there the only other thing
00:08:08.879
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m08s

you need to do is turn on public IP so
00:08:12.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m12s

that we can actually log into this and
00:08:16.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m16s

we can turn off auto snapshot to save
00:08:17.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m17s

the money or not having backups
00:08:20.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m20s

all right so if you then click on create
00:08:27.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m27s

your paper space about a minute later
00:08:29.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m29s

you will find that your machine will pop
00:08:32.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m32s

up here is my Ubuntu 1604 machine if you
00:08:37.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m37s

check your email you will find that they
00:08:42.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m42s

have emailed you a password so you can
00:08:46.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m46s

copy that
00:08:49.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m49s

and you can go to your machine and enter
00:08:50.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m50s

your password now to paste the password
00:08:54.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m54s

you would press ctrl shift V or on Mac
00:08:56.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h08m56s

against Apple shift V so it's slightly
00:09:00.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m00s

different to normal pasting or of course
00:09:04.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m04s

you can just type it in and here we are
00:09:06.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m06s

now we can make a little bit more room
00:09:11.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m11s

here by clicking on those little arrows
00:09:13.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m13s

there can zoom in a little bit and so as
00:09:15.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m15s

you can see we've got like a terminal
00:09:18.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m18s

that's sitting inside our browser it's
00:09:20.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m20s

just kind of quite a handy way to do it
00:09:24.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m24s

so now we need to configure this further
00:09:26.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m26s

course and so the way you can figure it
00:09:28.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m28s

for the course is you type curl HTTP
00:09:31.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m31s

colon slash slash files dot fast ai
00:09:37.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m37s

slash setup slash paper space type -
00:09:41.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m41s

okay
00:09:49.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m49s

and so that's then going to run a script
00:09:50.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m50s

which is going to set up all of the
00:09:52.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m52s

crudo drivers special Python Reaper
00:09:55.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h09m55s

Python distribution we use called
00:10:00.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m00s

anaconda all of the libraries or other
00:10:03.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m03s

courses and the data we use for the
00:10:05.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m05s

first part of the course ok so that
00:10:09.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m09s

takes an hour or so and when it's
00:10:11.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m11s

finished running you'll need to reboot
00:10:14.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m14s

your computer so to reboot not your own
00:10:16.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m16s

computer but your pages paste computer
00:10:19.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m19s

and so to do that you can just click on
00:10:21.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m21s

this little circular restart machine
00:10:23.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m23s

button ok and when it comes back up
00:10:25.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m25s

you'll be ready to go so what you'll
00:10:28.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m28s

find is if you've now got an anaconda
00:10:30.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m30s

three directory that's where your python
00:10:34.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m34s

is you've got a data directory which
00:10:36.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m36s

contains the data for
00:10:40.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m40s

the first part of this course first
00:10:41.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m41s

lesson which is their dogs and cats and
00:10:43.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m43s

you've got a fast AI directory and that
00:10:45.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m45s

contains everything for this course so
00:10:49.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m49s

what you should do is CD fast AI and
00:10:53.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m53s

from time to time you should go get Paul
00:10:58.879
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h10m58s

and that will just make sure that all of
00:11:00.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m00s

your fast AI stuff is up-to-date and
00:11:02.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m02s

also from time to time you might want to
00:11:06.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m06s

just check that your Python libraries
00:11:09.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m09s

are up-to-date and so you can type
00:11:10.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m10s

Condor and update to do that alright so
00:11:11.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m11s

make sure that you've CD into fast AI
00:11:17.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m17s

and then you can type Jupiter notebook
00:11:19.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m19s

all right there it is
00:11:26.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m26s

so we now have a Jupiter notebook
00:11:28.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m28s

servant running and we want to connect
00:11:30.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m30s

to that and so you can see here it says
00:11:32.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m32s

copy paste this URL into your browser
00:11:34.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m34s

when you connect so if you double click
00:11:38.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m38s

on it then that will actually that will
00:11:40.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m40s

actually copy it for you then you can go
00:11:46.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m46s

and paste it but you need to change this
00:11:49.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m49s

local host to be the paper space IP
00:11:52.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m52s

address so if you click on the little
00:11:55.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m55s

arrows to go smaller you can see the IP
00:11:57.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h11m57s

addresses here so I'll just copy that
00:12:00.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m00s

and paste it where it used to say local
00:12:03.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m03s

host okay so it's now HTTP and then my
00:12:08.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m08s

IP and then everything else a copied
00:12:10.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m10s

before and so there it is so this is the
00:12:13.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m13s

faster I get repo and our courses are
00:12:17.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m17s

all in courses and in there the deep
00:12:22.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m22s

learning part one is DL one and in there
00:12:25.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m25s

you will find lesson one by Mb ipython
00:12:28.939
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m28s

notebook
00:12:33.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m33s

so here we are ready to go depending
00:12:38.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m38s

whether you're using Kressel or paper
00:12:41.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m41s

space or something else if you check
00:12:43.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m43s

course it's not fast today I will keep
00:12:45.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m45s

putting additional videos and links to
00:12:47.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m47s

information about how to set up other
00:12:49.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m49s

you know good Jupiter notebook providers
00:12:51.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m51s

as well so to run a cell in Jupiter
00:12:54.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h12m54s

notebook you select the cell and you
00:13:01.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m01s

hold down shift and press Enter or if
00:13:03.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m03s

you've got the tool bar showing you can
00:13:07.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m07s

just click on the little Run button so
00:13:09.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m09s

you'll notice that some cells contain
00:13:12.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m12s

code and some contain text and some
00:13:14.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m14s

contain pictures and some contain videos
00:13:18.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m18s

so this environment basically has you
00:13:20.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m20s

know it's a it's a way that we can give
00:13:24.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m24s

you access to and a way to run
00:13:26.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m26s

experiments and to kind of tell you
00:13:29.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m29s

what's going on so pictures
00:13:31.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m31s

this is why it's like a super popular
00:13:34.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m34s

tool in data science a data science is
00:13:36.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m36s

kind of all about running experiments
00:13:39.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m39s

really so let's go ahead and click run
00:13:41.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m41s

and you'll see that cell turn into a
00:13:46.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m46s

star the one turn into a star for a
00:13:49.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m49s

moment and then it finished running okay
00:13:50.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m50s

so let's try the next one this time
00:13:53.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m53s

instead of using the toolbar I'm going
00:13:55.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m55s

to hold down shift and press ENTER and
00:13:56.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m56s

you can see again it turn into a star
00:13:59.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h13m59s

and then it said to so if I hold down
00:14:01.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m01s

shift and keep pressing enter it just
00:14:03.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m03s

keeps running each so right so I can put
00:14:05.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m05s

anything I like for example one plus one
00:14:08.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m08s

is two so what we're going to do is
00:14:10.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m10s

we're going to yes Rachel this is just a
00:14:16.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m16s

side note but I wanted to point out that
00:14:20.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m20s

we're using Python 3 here yes thank you
00:14:22.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m22s

pythons are still using Python - mmhmm
00:14:25.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m25s

yeah um and it is important to switch to
00:14:29.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m29s

Python 3 you know now well for Class A I
00:14:32.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m32s

you require it but you know increasingly
00:14:36.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m36s

a lot of libraries are removing support
00:14:39.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m39s

for Python - thanks Rachel
00:14:42.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m42s

now it mentions here that you can
00:14:48.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m48s

download the data set for this lesson
00:14:50.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m50s

from this location if you're using
00:14:52.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m52s

crystal or the paper space script that
00:14:56.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h14m56s

we just used to set up that this will
00:15:00.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m00s

already be and made available for you
00:15:02.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m02s

okay if you're not you'll need to W get
00:15:03.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m03s

it as now Kressel is quite a bit slower
00:15:05.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m05s

than paper space and also it there are
00:15:11.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m11s

some particular things it doesn't
00:15:15.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m15s

support that we really need and so there
00:15:16.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m16s

are a couple of extra steps if you're
00:15:19.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m19s

using cresol you have to run two more
00:15:21.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m21s

cells right so you can see these are
00:15:23.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m23s

commented out there quite hashes at the
00:15:25.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m25s

start so if you remove the hashes from
00:15:27.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m27s

these and run these two additional cells
00:15:29.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m29s

that just runs the stuff that the stuff
00:15:31.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m31s

that you only need for crystal I'm using
00:15:34.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m34s

paper space so I'm not going to run it
00:15:35.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m35s

ok so inside our data so we set up this
00:15:38.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m38s

path to data slash dogs cats that's pre
00:15:45.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m45s

set up for you and so inside there you
00:15:48.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m48s

can see here I can use an exclamation
00:15:51.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m51s

mark to basically say I don't want to
00:15:52.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m52s

run Python but I want to run bash right
00:15:57.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h15m57s

I want to run shell so this runs a bash
00:16:00.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m00s

command and the bit inside the curly
00:16:02.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m02s

brackets actually refers however to a
00:16:04.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m04s

python variable so inserts that python
00:16:07.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m07s

variable into the batch command so
00:16:09.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m09s

here's the contents of our folder
00:16:11.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m11s

there's a training set and a validation
00:16:13.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m13s

set if you're not familiar with the idea
00:16:16.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m16s

of training sets and validation sets it
00:16:19.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m19s

would be a very good idea to check out
00:16:22.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m22s

our practical machine learning course
00:16:23.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m23s

which tells you a lot about this kind of
00:16:26.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m26s

stuff if like yeah the basics of how to
00:16:29.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m29s

setup and run machine learning projects
00:16:32.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m32s

more generally would you recommend that
00:16:34.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m34s

people take that course before this one
00:16:37.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m37s

actually a lot of students who would you
00:16:40.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m40s

know as they went through these as said
00:16:43.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m43s

they'll they've liked doing them
00:16:45.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m45s

together so you can kind of check it out
00:16:46.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m46s

and see the machine learning course
00:16:49.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m49s

yeah they cover with some similar stuff
00:16:55.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m55s

but all in different directions so
00:16:57.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m57s

people have done both seen you know say
00:16:59.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h16m59s

they find it they
00:17:01.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m01s

they each support each other I wouldn't
00:17:02.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m02s

say it's a prerequisite but you know if
00:17:04.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m04s

I do if I say something like hey this is
00:17:07.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m07s

the training set and this is a
00:17:09.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m09s

validation set and you're going I don't
00:17:09.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m09s

know what that means
00:17:11.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m11s

at least Google but do a quick read you
00:17:12.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m12s

know because we're assuming that you
00:17:14.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m14s

know the very basics of kind of what
00:17:16.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m16s

machine learning is and does to some
00:17:20.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m20s

extent and I have a whole blog post on
00:17:22.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m22s

this topic as well okay and we'll make
00:17:25.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m25s

sure that you link to that from Pastor
00:17:27.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m27s

day night
00:17:29.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m29s

and as we just wanted to say in general
00:17:29.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m29s

with fasting our philosophy is to kind
00:17:31.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m31s

of learn things on an as-needed basis
00:17:35.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m35s

yeah exactly don't try and learn
00:17:37.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m37s

everything that you think you might need
00:17:39.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m39s

first otherwise you'll never get around
00:17:41.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m41s

elite learning the stuff you actually
00:17:42.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m42s

want to learn exactly that shows up in
00:17:44.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m44s

deep learning I think particularly a lot
00:17:46.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m46s

yes okay so in our validation folder
00:17:48.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m48s

there's a cat's folder and a dog's
00:17:53.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m53s

folder and then inside the validation
00:17:55.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m55s

cats folder is a whole bunch of JPEGs
00:17:57.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h17m57s

the reason that it's set up like this is
00:18:00.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m00s

that this is kind of the most common
00:18:03.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m03s

standard approach for how image
00:18:05.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m05s

classification datasets shared and
00:18:08.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m08s

provided and the idea is that each
00:18:10.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m10s

folder tells you the label
00:18:12.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m12s

so there's each of these images is
00:18:15.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m15s

labeled cats and each of the images and
00:18:18.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m18s

the dogs folder is labelled dogs okay
00:18:21.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m21s

this is how chaos works as well for
00:18:23.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m23s

example so this is a pretty standard way
00:18:25.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m25s

to share image classification files so
00:18:31.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m31s

we can have a look so if you go plot dot
00:18:37.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m37s

a.m. show we can see an example of the
00:18:40.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m40s

first of the cats if you haven't seen
00:18:43.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m43s

this before this is a Python 3.6 format
00:18:47.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m47s

string so you can google for that if you
00:18:51.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m51s

haven't seen it it's a very convenient
00:18:53.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m53s

way to do string formatting and we use
00:18:54.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m54s

it a lot so there's no cat but we're
00:18:56.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h18m56s

going to mainly be interested in the
00:19:01.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m01s

underlying data that makes up that cat
00:19:03.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m03s

so specifically it's an image whose
00:19:05.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m05s

shape that is the dimensions of the
00:19:10.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m10s

array is 198 by 1/7
00:19:12.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m12s

9x3 is it's a three dimensional array
00:19:14.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m14s

plus a quarter rank three tensor and
00:19:16.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m16s

here are the first four rows and four
00:19:19.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m19s

columns of that image so as you can see
00:19:21.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m21s

each of those cells has three items in
00:19:26.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m26s

it and this is the red green and blue
00:19:32.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m32s

pixel values between naught and 255 so
00:19:35.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m35s

here's a little subset of what a picture
00:19:37.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m37s

actually looks like inside your computer
00:19:40.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m40s

so that's that that's will be our idea
00:19:42.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m42s

is to take these kinds of numbers and
00:19:46.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m46s

use them to predict whether those kinds
00:19:48.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m48s

of numbers represent a cat or a dog
00:19:50.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m50s

based on looking at lots of pictures of
00:19:53.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m53s

cats and dogs so that's a pretty hard
00:19:56.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m56s

thing to do and at the point in time
00:19:58.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h19m58s

when this this this data set actually
00:20:01.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m01s

comes from a caracal competition the
00:20:04.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m04s

dogs versus cats caracal competition and
00:20:06.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m06s

when it was released in I think it was
00:20:08.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m08s

2012 the state of the art was 80%
00:20:10.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m10s

accuracy so computers weren't really
00:20:13.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m13s

able to at all accurately recognize dogs
00:20:16.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m16s

versus cats so let's go ahead and train
00:20:19.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m19s

a model so here are the three lines of
00:20:23.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m23s

code necessary to train a model and so
00:20:32.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m32s

let's go ahead and run it so I'll click
00:20:36.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m36s

on this on the cell I'll press shift
00:20:38.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m38s

enter and then we'll wait a couple of
00:20:39.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m39s

seconds for it to pop up and there it
00:20:45.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m45s

goes okay and it's training and so I've
00:20:47.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m47s

asked it to do three epochs so that
00:20:52.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m52s

means it's going to look at every image
00:20:53.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m53s

three times in total or look at the
00:20:55.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m55s

entire set of images three times that's
00:20:57.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h20m57s

what we mean by an epoch and as we do
00:21:00.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m00s

it's going to print out the accuracy is
00:21:02.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m02s

that's lasted for three numbers it
00:21:07.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m07s

prints out on the validation set okay
00:21:09.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m09s

the first three numbers we'll talk about
00:21:11.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m11s

later in short they're the value of the
00:21:13.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m13s

loss function which is in this case the
00:21:16.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m16s

cross-entropy loss for the training set
00:21:17.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m17s

and the validation set and then right at
00:21:19.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m19s

the start here is the epoch number so
00:21:21.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m21s

you can see it's getting about 90%
00:21:24.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m24s

see and it took 17 seconds so you can
00:21:28.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m28s

see we've come a long way since 2012 and
00:21:33.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m33s

in fact even in the competition this
00:21:35.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m35s

actually would have won the caracal
00:21:39.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m39s

competition of that time the best in the
00:21:42.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m42s

caracal competition was 98.9 and we're
00:21:44.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m44s

getting about 99% so this play surprised
00:21:46.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m46s

you that we're getting a you know Kaggle
00:21:50.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m50s

winning as of 20 and of 2012 early 2013
00:21:54.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m54s

kaggle winning image classifier in 17
00:21:59.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h21m59s

seconds that and three lines of code and
00:22:02.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m02s

I think that's because like a lot of
00:22:08.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m08s

people assume that deep learning takes a
00:22:10.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m10s

huge amount of time and lots of
00:22:13.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m13s

resources and lots of data and as you'll
00:22:17.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m17s

learn in this course that in general
00:22:19.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m19s

rule isn't true one of the ways we've
00:22:22.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m22s

made it much simpler is that this code
00:22:25.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m25s

is written on top of a library we built
00:22:28.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m28s

imaginatively called fast AI the faster
00:22:32.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m32s

a library is basically a library which
00:22:35.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m35s

takes all of the best practices
00:22:38.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m38s

approaches that we can find and so each
00:22:41.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m41s

time a paper comes out you know we that
00:22:44.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m44s

looks interesting we test it out if it
00:22:46.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m46s

works well for a variety of data sets
00:22:48.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m48s

and we can figure out how to tune it we
00:22:50.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m50s

implement it in fast AI and so faster I
00:22:52.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m52s

kind of curates all this stuff and
00:22:54.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m54s

packages up for you and much of the time
00:22:56.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m56s

but most the time kind of automatically
00:22:59.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h22m59s

figures out the best way to handle
00:23:01.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m01s

things so the first day our library is
00:23:03.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m03s

why we were able to do this in just
00:23:05.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m05s

three lines of code and the reason that
00:23:06.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m06s

we were able to make the faster I
00:23:09.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m09s

library work so well is because it
00:23:11.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m11s

interns it's on top of something called
00:23:13.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m13s

pi torch which is a really flexible deep
00:23:15.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m15s

learning and machine learning and GPU
00:23:20.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m20s

computation library written by Facebook
00:23:23.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m23s

most people are more familiar with
00:23:27.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m27s

tensorflow
00:23:29.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m29s

than pi torch because google markets
00:23:30.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m30s

that pretty heavily but most of the top
00:23:33.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m33s

researchers I know nowadays at least the
00:23:35.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m35s

ones that are at Google have switched
00:23:37.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m37s

across to PI torch yes Rachel
00:23:39.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m39s

and we'll be covering some pie torts
00:23:42.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m42s

later in the course yeah it's I mean one
00:23:43.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m43s

of the things that hopefully you'll
00:23:46.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m46s

really like about last AI is that it's
00:23:49.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m49s

really flexible that you can use all
00:23:52.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m52s

these kind of curated best practices as
00:23:54.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m54s

much as little as you want and so really
00:23:56.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m56s

easy to hook in at any point and write
00:23:59.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h23m59s

your own data augmentation write your
00:24:01.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m01s

own loss function write your own network
00:24:04.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m04s

architecture whatever and so we'll do
00:24:06.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m06s

all of those things in this course so
00:24:08.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m08s

what does this model look like well what
00:24:12.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m12s

we can do is we can take a look at so
00:24:15.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m15s

what are the what is the validation set
00:24:20.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m20s

dependent variable the Y look like and
00:24:22.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m22s

it's just a bunch of zeros and ones okay
00:24:24.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m24s

so the zeros if we look at data dot
00:24:27.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m27s

classes the zeros represent cats the
00:24:29.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m29s

ones represent dogs you'll see here
00:24:31.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m31s

there's basically two objects I'm
00:24:34.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m34s

working with one is an object called
00:24:35.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m35s

data which contains the validation and
00:24:36.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m36s

training data and another one is the
00:24:39.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m39s

object called learn which contains the
00:24:41.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m41s

model right so anytime you want to find
00:24:43.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m43s

something out about the data we can look
00:24:45.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m45s

inside data so we're going to get
00:24:47.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m47s

predictions through our validation set
00:24:50.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m50s

and so to do that we can call learned
00:24:52.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m52s

predict and so you can see here the
00:24:54.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m54s

first ten predictions and what it's
00:24:59.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h24m59s

giving you as a prediction for dog and a
00:25:01.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m01s

prediction for cat now the way PI Torche
00:25:04.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m04s

generally works and therefore fast AI
00:25:07.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m07s

also works is that most models return
00:25:08.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m08s

the log of the predictions rather than
00:25:11.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m11s

the probabilities themselves we'll learn
00:25:16.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m16s

why that is later in the course so for
00:25:18.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m18s

now recognize that to get your
00:25:20.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m20s

probabilities you have to get e to the
00:25:21.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m21s

power of you'll see here we're using
00:25:25.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m25s

numpy NP is none play if you're not
00:25:28.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m28s

familiar with numpy that is one of the
00:25:31.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m31s

things that we assume that you have some
00:25:33.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m33s

familiarity with so be sure to check out
00:25:35.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m35s

the material on cost I passed at AI to
00:25:38.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m38s

learn the basics of number it's the way
00:25:40.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m40s

that - handles all of the fast numerical
00:25:45.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m45s

programming array computation that kind
00:25:51.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m51s

of thing
00:25:54.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m54s

okay so we can get the probabilities
00:25:55.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m55s

using that using MP dot X and there's a
00:25:58.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h25m58s

few functions here that you can look at
00:26:03.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m03s

yourself if you're interested that's
00:26:04.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m04s

just some flooding functions that we'll
00:26:05.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m05s

use and so we can now plot some random
00:26:07.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m07s

correct images and so here are some
00:26:12.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m12s

images that it's correct about okay and
00:26:17.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m17s

so remember one is a dog so anything
00:26:20.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m20s

greater than 0.5 is dog and zero is a
00:26:23.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m23s

cat so this is what 10 to the negative 5
00:26:26.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m26s

obviously a cat here are some which are
00:26:28.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m28s

incorrect alright so you can see that
00:26:32.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m32s

some of these which it thinks are
00:26:34.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m34s

incorrect obviously are just the you
00:26:36.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m36s

know images that shouldn't be there at
00:26:38.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m38s

all but clearly this one which it called
00:26:40.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m40s

a a dog is not at all a dog so there are
00:26:43.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m43s

some obvious mistakes we can also take a
00:26:47.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m47s

look at which cats is it the most
00:26:52.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m52s

confident are cats which dogs are the
00:26:56.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m56s

most doglike the most confident dogs
00:26:59.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h26m59s

perhaps more interestingly we can also
00:27:03.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m03s

see which cats is that the most
00:27:05.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m05s

confident are actually dogs so which
00:27:07.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m07s

ones it is it the most wrong about and
00:27:09.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m09s

same thing for the ones the dog said it
00:27:12.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m12s

really thinks of cats and again some of
00:27:15.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m15s

these are just pretty weird I guess
00:27:18.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m18s

there is a dog in there yes Rachel I see
00:27:20.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m20s

suit you want to see more about why you
00:27:23.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m23s

would want to look at your data yeah
00:27:25.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m25s

sure so yeah so finally I just mentioned
00:27:28.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m28s

the last one we've got here is to see
00:27:33.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m33s

which ones have the probability closest
00:27:35.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m35s

to 0.5 so these are the ones that the
00:27:37.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m37s

model knows it doesn't really know what
00:27:39.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m39s

to do with and some of these it's not
00:27:42.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m42s

surprising so yeah I mean this is kind
00:27:43.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m43s

of like always the first thing I do
00:27:48.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m48s

after I build a model is to try to find
00:27:51.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m51s

a way to like visualize what it's built
00:27:54.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m54s

because if I want to make the model
00:27:57.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m57s

better then I need to take advantage of
00:27:59.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h27m59s

the things that's doing well and fix the
00:28:01.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m01s

things that's doing badly and so in this
00:28:03.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m03s

case and off
00:28:05.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m05s

this is the case I've learned something
00:28:08.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m08s

about the data set itself which is that
00:28:10.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m10s

there are some things that are in here
00:28:11.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m11s

that probably shouldn't be but I've also
00:28:13.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m13s

like it's also clear that this model has
00:28:17.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m17s

room to improve like to me that's pretty
00:28:21.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m21s

obviously a dog but one thing I'm
00:28:25.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m25s

suspicious about here is this image is
00:28:28.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m28s

very kind of fat and short and as we all
00:28:31.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m31s

learn the way these algorithms work is
00:28:38.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m38s

it kind of grabs a square piece at a
00:28:41.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m41s

time
00:28:44.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m44s

so this rather makes me suspicious that
00:28:45.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m45s

we're going to need to use something
00:28:47.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m47s

called data augmentation that we'll
00:28:48.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m48s

learn about learn about later to handle
00:28:50.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m50s

this properly okay so that's it right
00:28:52.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h28m52s

we've now built we've now built an image
00:29:00.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m00s

classifier and something that you should
00:29:05.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m05s

try now is to grab some data yourself
00:29:07.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m07s

some pictures of two or more different
00:29:13.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m13s

types of thing put them in different
00:29:17.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m17s

folders and run the same three lines of
00:29:19.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m19s

code on them okay and you'll find that
00:29:22.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m22s

it will work for that as well as long as
00:29:27.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m27s

that they are pictures of things like
00:29:31.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m31s

the kinds of things that people normally
00:29:33.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m33s

take photos of right so if their
00:29:35.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m35s

microscope microscope pictures or
00:29:38.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m38s

pathology pictures or CT scans or
00:29:40.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m40s

something this won't work very well as
00:29:44.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m44s

well learn about later there are some
00:29:46.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m46s

other things we didn't need to do to
00:29:47.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m47s

make that work but for things that look
00:29:49.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m49s

like normal photos these you can run
00:29:51.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m51s

exactly the same three lines of code and
00:29:56.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m56s

just point your path variable somewhere
00:29:58.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h29m58s

else to get your own image classifier so
00:30:02.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m02s

for example one student took those three
00:30:05.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m05s

lines of code downloaded for Google
00:30:10.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m10s

Images ten examples of pictures of
00:30:12.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m12s

people playing cricket ten examples of
00:30:14.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m14s

people playing baseball and build a
00:30:17.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m17s

classifier of those images which was new
00:30:19.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m19s

perfectly correct the same student
00:30:22.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m22s

actually also tried downloading seven
00:30:25.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m25s

pictures of Canadian currency seven
00:30:28.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m28s

pictures of American currency and again
00:30:32.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m32s

in that case the model was a hundred
00:30:34.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m34s

percent accurate so you can just go to
00:30:37.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m37s

Google Images if you like and download a
00:30:39.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m39s

few things of a few different classes
00:30:41.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m41s

and see see what works and tell us on
00:30:43.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m43s

the forum both your successes and your
00:30:45.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m45s

failures so what we just did was to
00:30:47.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m47s

train a neural network but we didn't
00:30:55.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m55s

first of all tell you what a neural
00:30:58.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m58s

network is or what training means or
00:30:59.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h30m59s

anything why is that well this is the
00:31:02.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m02s

start of our top-down approach to
00:31:07.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m07s

learning and basically the idea is that
00:31:10.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m10s

unlike the way math and technical
00:31:13.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m13s

subjects I usually talk where you learn
00:31:16.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m16s

every little element piece by piece and
00:31:18.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m18s

you don't actually get to put them all
00:31:21.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m21s

together and build your own image
00:31:23.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m23s

classifier until third year of graduate
00:31:25.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m25s

school our approach is to say from the
00:31:28.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m28s

start hey let's show you how to train an
00:31:31.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m31s

image classifier and you can start doing
00:31:34.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m34s

stuff and then gradually we dig deeper
00:31:36.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m36s

and deeper and deeper and so the idea is
00:31:39.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m39s

that throughout the course you're going
00:31:44.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m44s

to see like new problems that we want to
00:31:47.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m47s

solve so for example in the next lesson
00:31:50.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m50s

we'll look at well what if we're not
00:31:53.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m53s

looking at normal kinds of photos but
00:31:57.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m57s

we're looking at satellite images and
00:31:59.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h31m59s

we'll see why it is that this approach
00:32:01.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m01s

that we're learning today doesn't quite
00:32:03.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m03s

work as well and what things do we have
00:32:05.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m05s

to change and so we'll learn enough
00:32:07.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m07s

about the theory to understand why that
00:32:09.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m09s

happens and then we'll learn about the
00:32:11.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m11s

libraries and how we can change change
00:32:13.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m13s

things with the libraries to make that
00:32:15.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m15s

work better and so during the course we
00:32:17.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m17s

are gradually going to learn to solve
00:32:21.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m21s

more and more problems as we do so we
00:32:23.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m23s

all need to learn more and more parts of
00:32:26.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m26s

the library more and more bits of the
00:32:28.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m28s

theory until by the end we're actually
00:32:30.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m30s

going to learn how to create a
00:32:32.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m32s

world plus neural net architecture from
00:32:35.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m35s

scratch and our own training loop from
00:32:39.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m39s

scratch and so were actually built
00:32:41.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m41s

everything ourselves so that's the
00:32:43.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m43s

general approach yes Rachel and
00:32:46.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m46s

sometimes also call this the whole game
00:32:50.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m50s

which is inspired by harvard professor
00:32:52.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m52s

david perkins yeah and so the idea with
00:32:55.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m55s

the whole game is like this is more like
00:32:58.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h32m58s

how you would learn baseball or music
00:33:00.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m00s

with baseball you would get taken to a
00:33:02.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m02s

ball game you would learn what baseball
00:33:04.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m04s

is you would start playing it and it
00:33:06.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m06s

would only be years later that you might
00:33:10.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m10s

learn about the physics of how curveball
00:33:12.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m12s

works for example well with music we put
00:33:14.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m14s

a instrument in your hand and you start
00:33:17.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m17s

banging the drum or hitting the
00:33:20.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m20s

xylophone and it's not until years later
00:33:21.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m21s

that you learn about the circle of
00:33:23.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m23s

fifths and understand how to construct a
00:33:25.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m25s

cadence example so yeah so that this is
00:33:27.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m27s

kind of the approach we're using it's
00:33:32.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m32s

very inspired by David Perkins and other
00:33:33.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m33s

writers of Education so what that does
00:33:36.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m36s

mean is to take advantage of this as we
00:33:40.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m40s

peel back the layers we want you to keep
00:33:42.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m42s

like looking under the hood yourself as
00:33:45.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m45s

well like experiment a lot now because
00:33:47.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m47s

this is a very code driven approach so
00:33:50.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m50s

here's basically what happens right we
00:33:53.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m53s

start out looking today at convolutional
00:33:55.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m55s

neural networks for images and then in a
00:33:58.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h33m58s

couple of lessons we'll start to look at
00:34:01.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m01s

how to use neural nets to look at
00:34:03.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m03s

structured data and then look at
00:34:04.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m04s

language data and then look at
00:34:06.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m06s

recommendation system data and then we
00:34:09.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m09s

kind of then take all of those depths
00:34:13.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m13s

and we go backwards through them in
00:34:15.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m15s

reverse order so now you know by the end
00:34:17.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m17s

of that fourth piece you will know by
00:34:19.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m19s

the end of lesson four how to create a
00:34:24.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m24s

world-class image classifier a
00:34:26.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m26s

world-class structured data analysis
00:34:28.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m28s

program world-class language classifier
00:34:31.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m31s

broad class recommendation system and
00:34:34.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m34s

then we're going to go back over all of
00:34:37.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m37s

them again and learn in depth about like
00:34:38.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m38s

well what exactly did it do and how to
00:34:41.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m41s

do work and how do we change things
00:34:42.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m42s

around and use it in different
00:34:45.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m45s

situations for for
00:34:46.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m46s

recommendation systems structured data
00:34:48.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m48s

images and then finally back to language
00:34:51.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m51s

so that's how it's going to work so what
00:34:54.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m54s

that kind of means is that most students
00:34:57.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h34m57s

find that they tend to watch the videos
00:35:00.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m00s

two or three times but not like watch
00:35:02.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m02s

lesson one two or three times and listen
00:35:07.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m07s

to two or three times in verse and three
00:35:09.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m09s

three times but like they do the whole
00:35:10.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m10s

thing into end lessons one through seven
00:35:12.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m12s

and then go back and start lesson one
00:35:14.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m14s

again that's an approach which a lot of
00:35:17.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m17s

people find when they want to go back
00:35:20.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m20s

and understand all the details enough
00:35:22.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m22s

that can work pretty well so I would say
00:35:24.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m24s

you know aim to get through to the end
00:35:26.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m26s

of lesson seven you know as as quickly
00:35:29.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m29s

as you can rather than aiming to fully
00:35:34.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m34s

understand every detail from this data
00:35:37.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m37s

so basically the plan is that in today's
00:35:41.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m41s

lesson you'll learn in as few lines of
00:35:45.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m45s

code as possible with as few details as
00:35:49.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m49s

possible how do you actually build an
00:35:51.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m51s

image classifier with deep learning to
00:35:53.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m53s

do this to in this case say hey here are
00:35:55.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m55s

some pictures of dogs as opposed to
00:35:58.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h35m58s

pictures of cats then we're going to
00:36:00.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m00s

learn how to look at different kinds of
00:36:04.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m04s

images and particularly we're going to
00:36:07.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m07s

look at images of from satellites and
00:36:09.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m09s

we're going to say for a satellite image
00:36:12.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m12s

what kinds of things might you be seeing
00:36:13.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m13s

in that image and there could be
00:36:17.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m17s

multiple things that we're looking at so
00:36:18.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m18s

a multi-label classification problem
00:36:20.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m20s

from there we'll move to something which
00:36:22.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m22s

is perhaps the most widely applicable
00:36:25.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m25s

for the most people which is looking at
00:36:28.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m28s

what we call structured data so data
00:36:30.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m30s

about data that kind of comes from
00:36:33.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m33s

databases or spreadsheets so we're going
00:36:37.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m37s

to specifically look at this data set of
00:36:40.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m40s

predicting sales the number of things
00:36:42.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m42s

that are sold at different stores on
00:36:44.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m44s

different dates based on different
00:36:47.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m47s

holidays and and so on and so forth and
00:36:49.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m49s

so we're going to be doing its sales
00:36:52.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m52s

forecasting exercise after that we're
00:36:53.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m53s

going to look at language and we're
00:36:57.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m57s

going to figure out
00:36:59.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h36m59s

what this person thinks about the movie
00:37:01.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m01s

is on be given and will be able to
00:37:04.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m04s

figure out how to create just like we
00:37:06.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m06s

create image classifiers for any kind of
00:37:08.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m08s

image will learn to create in NLP
00:37:10.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m10s

classifiers to classify any kind of
00:37:12.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m12s

language in lots of different ways then
00:37:15.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m15s

we'll look at something called
00:37:19.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m19s

collaborative filtering which is used
00:37:20.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m20s

mainly for recommendation systems we're
00:37:22.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m22s

going to be looking at this data set
00:37:24.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m24s

that showed four different people for
00:37:26.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m26s

different movies what rating did they
00:37:27.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m27s

give it and here are some of the movies
00:37:29.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m29s

and so this is maybe an easier way to
00:37:31.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m31s

think about it is there are lots of
00:37:34.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m34s

different users and lots of different
00:37:36.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m36s

movies and then for each one we can look
00:37:38.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m38s

up for each user how much they liked
00:37:40.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m40s

that movie and the goal will be of
00:37:42.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m42s

course to predict for user movie
00:37:44.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m44s

combinations we haven't seen before are
00:37:47.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m47s

they likely to enjoy that movie or not
00:37:49.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m49s

and that's the really common approach
00:37:51.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m51s

used for like deciding what stuff to put
00:37:54.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m54s

on your homepage when somebody's
00:37:57.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m57s

visiting you know what book might they
00:37:59.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h37m59s

want to read or what film might they
00:38:00.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m00s

want to see or so forth from there we
00:38:02.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m02s

could have then dig back into language a
00:38:06.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m06s

bit more and we're going to look at
00:38:09.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m09s

actually we're gonna look at the
00:38:11.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m11s

writings of Nietzsche the philosopher
00:38:13.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m13s

and learn how to create our own
00:38:15.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m15s

Nietzsche philosophy from scratch
00:38:17.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m17s

character by character so this here
00:38:19.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m19s

perhaps that every life values a blood
00:38:22.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m22s

of intercourse when it senses there is
00:38:24.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m24s

unscrupulous who's very right sense to
00:38:26.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m26s

impulse love is not actually Nietzsche
00:38:28.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m28s

that's actually like some character by
00:38:31.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m31s

character generated text that we built
00:38:34.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m34s

with this recurrent neural network and
00:38:37.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m37s

then finally we're going to loop all the
00:38:41.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m41s

way back to computer vision again we're
00:38:43.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m43s

going to learn how not just to recognize
00:38:45.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m45s

cats from dogs how to actually find like
00:38:47.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m47s

where the cat is with this kind of hate
00:38:49.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m49s

map and we're also going to learn how to
00:38:51.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m51s

write our own architectures from scratch
00:38:54.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m54s

so this is an example of a resonate
00:38:56.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m56s

which is the kind of network that we are
00:38:59.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h38m59s

using in today's lesson for computer
00:39:02.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m02s

vision and so we'll actually end up
00:39:04.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m04s

building the network and the training
00:39:06.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m06s

loop from scratch and so they're
00:39:08.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m08s

basically the the steps that we're going
00:39:10.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m10s

to be taking from here
00:39:12.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m12s

and at each step we're going to be
00:39:14.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m14s

getting into increasing amounts of
00:39:15.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m15s

detail about how to actually do these
00:39:18.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m18s

things yourself so we've actually heard
00:39:20.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m20s

that from our students of past courses
00:39:25.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m25s

about what they've found and one of the
00:39:27.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m27s

things that we've heard a lot of
00:39:31.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m31s

students say is that there's been too
00:39:34.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m34s

much time on theory and research and not
00:39:37.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m37s

enough time running the code and even
00:39:41.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m41s

after we tell people about this morning
00:39:44.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m44s

where they still come to the end of the
00:39:47.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m47s

course not and say I wish I had taken
00:39:48.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m48s

more seriously that advice which is to
00:39:50.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m50s

keep running code so these are actual
00:39:54.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m54s

quotes from our forum in retrospect I
00:39:56.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m56s

should have spent the majority of my
00:39:59.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h39m59s

time on the actual code and the
00:40:00.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m00s

notebooks see what goes in see what
00:40:03.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m03s

comes out now this idea that you can
00:40:07.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m07s

create world-class models in a code
00:40:13.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m13s

first approach learning what you need as
00:40:17.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m17s

you go is very different to a lot of the
00:40:19.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m19s

advice you're read out there such as
00:40:21.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m21s

this person on the forum hacker news who
00:40:23.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m23s

claimed that the best way to become an
00:40:28.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m28s

m/l engineer is to learn all of math and
00:40:30.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m30s

C and C++ learn parallel programming
00:40:34.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m34s

learn ml algorithms implement them
00:40:38.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m38s

yourself using plain C and finally start
00:40:40.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m40s

doing ml so we would say if you want to
00:40:43.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m43s

become an effective practitioner do
00:40:46.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m46s

exactly the opposite of of this yes
00:40:47.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m47s

Rachel yeah I'm just highlighting that
00:40:51.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m51s

this is we think this is bad advice and
00:40:53.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m53s

this can be very discouraging for a lot
00:40:56.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m56s

of people to come across this yeah yeah
00:40:58.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h40m58s

it's it's it's it's you know we now have
00:41:00.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m00s

thousands and more tens of thousands of
00:41:03.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m03s

people that have done this course and
00:41:04.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m04s

have lots and lots of examples of people
00:41:06.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m06s

who are now running research labs or
00:41:11.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m11s

Google brain residence or you know have
00:41:14.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m14s

created patents based on deep learning
00:41:18.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m18s

and so forth who have done it by doing
00:41:20.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m20s

this course so the top-down approach
00:41:22.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m22s

works super well
00:41:24.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m24s

now one thing to mention is like we've
00:41:27.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m27s

we've now already learned how you can
00:41:30.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m30s

actually train a world-class image
00:41:32.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m32s

classifier in 17 seconds I should
00:41:34.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m34s

mention by the way the first time you
00:41:38.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m38s

run that code there are two things it
00:41:40.759
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m40s

has to do that take more than 17 seconds
00:41:43.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m43s

one is that it downloads a pre trained
00:41:45.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m45s

model from the internet so you'll see
00:41:48.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m48s

the first time you run it it'll say
00:41:50.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m50s

downloading model so that takes a minute
00:41:52.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m52s

or two also the first time you run it it
00:41:55.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m55s

pre computes and caches some of the
00:41:58.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h41m58s

intermediate information that it needs
00:42:01.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m01s

and that takes about a minute and a half
00:42:02.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m02s

as well so if the first time you run it
00:42:05.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m05s

it takes three or four minutes to
00:42:08.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m08s

download and pre compute stuff that's
00:42:11.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m11s

normal if you run it again you should
00:42:13.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m13s

find it takes 20 seconds or so so image
00:42:15.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m15s

classifiers
00:42:20.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m20s

you know you may not feel like you need
00:42:21.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m21s

to recognize cats versus dogs very often
00:42:24.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m24s

on a computer you can probably do it
00:42:27.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m27s

yourself pretty well but what's
00:42:29.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m29s

interestingly interesting is that these
00:42:31.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m31s

image classification algorithms are
00:42:33.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m33s

really useful for lots and lots of
00:42:35.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m35s

things for example alphago which became
00:42:37.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m37s

which beat the go world champion the way
00:42:43.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m43s

it worked was to use something at its
00:42:46.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m46s

heart that looked almost exactly like
00:42:50.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m50s

our dogs vs. cats image classification
00:42:53.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m53s

algorithm it looked at thousands and
00:42:55.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m55s

thousands of go boards and at for each
00:42:58.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h42m58s

one there was a label saying whether
00:43:02.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m02s

that go board ended up being the winning
00:43:04.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m04s

or the losing player and so it learnt
00:43:06.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m06s

basically an image classification that
00:43:10.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m10s

was able to look at a go board and
00:43:13.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m13s

figure out whether it was a good group
00:43:15.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m15s

or a bad code board and that's really
00:43:16.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m16s

the key most important step in playing
00:43:19.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m19s

Gowell is to know which which move is
00:43:22.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m22s

better another example is one of our
00:43:25.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m25s

earlier students who actually got a
00:43:29.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m29s

couple of patterns for this work looked
00:43:33.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m33s

at anti-fraud he had lots of
00:43:36.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m36s

all of his customers mouths movements
00:43:40.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m40s

because they they provided kind of these
00:43:42.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m42s

user tracking software to help avoid
00:43:45.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m45s

fraud and so he took the the mouse paths
00:43:48.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m48s

basically of the users on his customers
00:43:52.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m52s

websites turn them into pictures of
00:43:56.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m56s

where their mouse moved and how quickly
00:43:59.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h43m59s

it moved and then built a image
00:44:01.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m01s

classifier that took those images as
00:44:04.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m04s

input and as output it was was that a
00:44:07.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m07s

fraudulent transaction or not and turned
00:44:10.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m10s

out to go you know really great results
00:44:13.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m13s

for his company so image classifiers are
00:44:15.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m15s

like much more flexible than you might
00:44:19.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m19s

imagine
00:44:22.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m22s

so so this is how you know some of the
00:44:23.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m23s

ways you can use deep learning
00:44:28.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m28s

specifically for image recognition and
00:44:29.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m29s

it's worth understanding that deep
00:44:33.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m33s

learning is not you know just a word
00:44:37.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m37s

that means the same thing as machine
00:44:41.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m41s

learning right like what is it that
00:44:42.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m42s

we're actually doing here when we're
00:44:44.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m44s

doing deep learning instead deep
00:44:45.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m45s

learning is a kind of machine learning
00:44:48.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m48s

so machine learning was invented by this
00:44:50.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m50s

guy Arthur Samuels who was pretty
00:44:53.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m53s

amazing
00:44:55.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m55s

in the late 50s he got this IBM
00:44:55.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m55s

mainframe to play checkers better than
00:44:58.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h44m58s

he can and the way he did it was he
00:45:01.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m01s

invented machine learning he got the
00:45:04.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m04s

mainframe to play against itself lots of
00:45:07.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m07s

times and figure out which kinds of
00:45:10.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m10s

things led to victories and which kinds
00:45:13.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m13s

of things didn't and use that to kind of
00:45:14.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m14s

almost write its own program and Arthur
00:45:18.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m18s

Arthur Samuels actually said in 1962
00:45:20.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m20s

that he thought that one day the vast
00:45:23.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m23s

majority of computer software would be
00:45:25.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m25s

written using this machine learning
00:45:27.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m27s

approach rather than written by hand by
00:45:30.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m30s

writing the loops and so forth by hand
00:45:32.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m32s

so I guess that hasn't happened yet but
00:45:34.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m34s

it seems to be in the process of
00:45:38.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m38s

happening I think one of the reasons it
00:45:40.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m40s

didn't happen for a long time is because
00:45:43.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m43s

traditional machine learning actually
00:45:45.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m45s

was very difficult and very
00:45:47.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m47s

knowledge and time intensive so for
00:45:51.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m51s

example here's something called the
00:45:54.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m54s

computational pathologist or C path from
00:45:55.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m55s

backwater and II back and II back back
00:45:59.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h45m59s

when he was at Stanford he's now moved
00:46:01.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m01s

on to somewhere on the East Coast no
00:46:04.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m04s

Harvard I think and what he did was he
00:46:07.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m07s

took these pathology slides of breast
00:46:11.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m11s

cancer biopsies right and he worked with
00:46:13.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m13s

lots of pathologists to come up with
00:46:18.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m18s

ideas about what kinds of patterns or
00:46:21.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m21s

features might be associated with so
00:46:24.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m24s

long-term survival versus versus dying
00:46:27.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m27s

quickly basically and so he came up with
00:46:31.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m31s

these ideas like well they came up with
00:46:34.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m34s

these ideas like relationship between
00:46:36.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m36s

epithelial nuclear neighbors
00:46:37.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m37s

relationship between epithelial and
00:46:39.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m39s

stromal objects and so forth and so they
00:46:41.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m41s

came up with all of these ideas of
00:46:44.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m44s

features these are just a few of the
00:46:45.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m45s

hundreds that they thought of and then
00:46:47.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m47s

lots of smart computer programmers wrote
00:46:49.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m49s

specialist algorithms to to calculate
00:46:53.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m53s

all these different features and then
00:46:56.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m56s

those those features were passed into a
00:46:58.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h46m58s

logistic regression to predict survival
00:47:01.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m01s

and it ended up working very well and it
00:47:04.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m04s

ended up that the survival predictions
00:47:07.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m07s

were more accurate than pathologists own
00:47:10.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m10s

survival predictions work and so machine
00:47:13.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m13s

learning can work really well but the
00:47:16.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m16s

point here is that this was a an
00:47:18.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m18s

approach that took lots of domain
00:47:21.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m21s

experts and computer experts many years
00:47:23.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m23s

of work to actually to build this thing
00:47:27.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m27s

right so we really want something
00:47:30.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m30s

something better and so specifically I'm
00:47:37.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m37s

going to show you something which rather
00:47:41.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m41s

than being a very specific function with
00:47:43.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m43s

all this very domain-specific feature
00:47:47.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m47s

engineering we're going to try and
00:47:51.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m51s

create an infinitely flexible function a
00:47:53.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m53s

function that could solve any problem
00:47:56.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m56s

right it would solve any problem if only
00:47:58.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h47m58s

you set the parameters of that function
00:48:01.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m01s

correctly and so then we need
00:48:03.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m03s

or purpose way of setting the parameters
00:48:05.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m05s

of that function and we would need that
00:48:07.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m07s

to be fast and scalable right now if we
00:48:10.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m10s

had something that had these three
00:48:12.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m12s

things then you wouldn't need to do this
00:48:14.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m14s

incredibly time and domain knowledge
00:48:16.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m16s

intensive approach anymore instead we
00:48:18.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m18s

can learn all of those things with this
00:48:21.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m21s

with this algorithm so as you might have
00:48:24.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m24s

guessed the algorithm in question which
00:48:28.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m28s

has these three properties is called
00:48:31.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m31s

deep learning or it's not an algorithm
00:48:33.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m33s

then maybe we will call it a class of
00:48:36.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m36s

algorithms let's look at each of these
00:48:38.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m38s

three things in turn so the underlying
00:48:41.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m41s

function that deep learning uses is
00:48:44.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m44s

something called the neural network now
00:48:47.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m47s

the neural network we're going to learn
00:48:50.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m50s

all about it and implemented ourselves
00:48:53.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m53s

from scratch later on in the course but
00:48:54.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m54s

for now all you need to know about it is
00:48:57.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m57s

that it consists of a number of simple
00:48:59.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h48m59s

linear layers interspersed with a number
00:49:02.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m02s

of simple nonlinear layers and when you
00:49:05.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m05s

in dispersed these layers in this way
00:49:10.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m10s

you get something called the universal
00:49:12.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m12s

approximation theorem and the universal
00:49:15.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m15s

approximation theorem says that this
00:49:18.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m18s

kind of function can solve any given
00:49:20.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m20s

problem to arbitrarily close accuracy as
00:49:24.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m24s

long as you add enough parameters so
00:49:28.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m28s

it's actually provably shown to be an
00:49:32.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m32s

infinitely flexible function okay so now
00:49:35.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m35s

we need some way to fit the parameters
00:49:39.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m39s

so that this infinitely flexible neural
00:49:41.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m41s

network solves some specific problem and
00:49:43.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m43s

so the way we do that is using a
00:49:46.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m46s

technique that probably most of you will
00:49:49.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m49s

have come across before at some stage
00:49:51.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m51s

called gradient descent and with
00:49:53.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m53s

gradient descent we basically say okay
00:49:55.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m55s

well for the different parameters we
00:49:58.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m58s

have how how good are they at solving my
00:49:59.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h49m59s

problem and let's figure out a slightly
00:50:03.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m03s

better set of parameters and a slightly
00:50:06.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m06s

better set of parameters and j6v follow
00:50:09.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m09s

down the the surface of the loss
00:50:11.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m11s

function downwards it's kind of like a
00:50:14.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m14s

marble going down
00:50:15.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m15s

find the minimum and as you can see here
00:50:18.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m18s

depending on where you start you end up
00:50:21.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m21s

in different places these things a court
00:50:23.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m23s

local minima now interestingly it turns
00:50:27.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m27s

out that for neural networks
00:50:31.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m31s

particularly in particular there aren't
00:50:32.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m32s

actually multiple different local minima
00:50:36.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m36s

there's basically just there's basically
00:50:41.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m41s

just one right or think of it another
00:50:44.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m44s

way there are different parts of the
00:50:46.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m46s

space which are all equally good so
00:50:48.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m48s

gradient descent therefore turns out to
00:50:53.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m53s

be actually an excellent way to solve
00:50:56.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m56s

this problem of fitting parameters to
00:50:59.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h50m59s

neural networks the problem is though
00:51:02.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m02s

that we need to do it in a reasonable
00:51:06.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m06s

amount of time
00:51:08.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m08s

and it's really only thanks to GPUs that
00:51:09.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m09s

that's become possible so GPUs this
00:51:12.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m12s

shows over the last few years
00:51:16.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m16s

how many gigaflops per second can you
00:51:19.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m19s

get out of a GPU that's the red and
00:51:22.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m22s

green versus a CPU that's the blue right
00:51:26.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m26s

and this is on a log scale so you can
00:51:29.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m29s

see that generally speaking the GPUs are
00:51:32.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m32s

about 10 times faster than the CPUs and
00:51:36.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m36s

what's really interesting is that
00:51:42.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m42s

nowadays not only is the Titan X about
00:51:44.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m44s

10 times faster than the e5 to $6.99 CPU
00:51:48.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m48s

but the Titan X well actually better one
00:51:51.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m51s

to look at would be the GTX 1080i GPU
00:51:56.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m56s

costs about 700 bucks
00:51:59.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h51m59s

whereas the CPU which is 10 times slower
00:52:01.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m01s

costs over $4,000 so GPUs turn out to be
00:52:04.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m04s

able to solve these neural network
00:52:10.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m10s

parameter fitting problems incredibly
00:52:14.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m14s

quickly and also incredibly cheaply so
00:52:17.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m17s

they've been absolutely key in bringing
00:52:20.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m20s

these three pieces together then there's
00:52:24.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m24s

one more piece which is I mentioned that
00:52:28.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m28s

these neural network
00:52:31.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m31s

so you can intersperse multiple sets of
00:52:32.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m32s

linear and then nonlinear layers in the
00:52:34.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m34s

particular example that's drawn here
00:52:40.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m40s

there's actually only one what we call
00:52:42.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m42s

hidden layer one layer in the middle and
00:52:44.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m44s

something that we learned in the last
00:52:46.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m46s

few years is that these kinds of neural
00:52:48.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m48s

networks although they do support the
00:52:51.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m51s

universal approximation theorem they can
00:52:53.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m53s

solve any given problem arbitrarily
00:52:55.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m55s

closely they require an exponentially
00:52:58.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h52m58s

increasing number of parameters to do so
00:53:02.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m02s

so they don't actually solve the fast
00:53:04.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m04s

and scalable for even reasonable size
00:53:07.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m07s

problems but we've since discovered that
00:53:09.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m09s

if you create add multiple hidden layers
00:53:14.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m14s

then you get super linear scaling so you
00:53:16.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m16s

can add a few more hidden layers to get
00:53:20.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m20s

multiplicatively more accuracy 2ma
00:53:23.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m23s

duplicative lis more complex problems
00:53:27.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m27s

and that is where it becomes called deep
00:53:28.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m28s

learning so deep learning means a neural
00:53:32.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m32s

network with multiple hidden layers so
00:53:34.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m34s

when you put all this together there's
00:53:41.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m41s

actually really amazing what happens
00:53:43.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m43s

Google started investing in deep
00:53:46.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m46s

learning in 2012 they actually hired
00:53:49.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m49s

Geoffrey Hinton who's kind of the father
00:53:54.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m54s

of deep learning and his top student
00:53:56.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m56s

Alex Bogusky and they started trying to
00:53:59.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h53m59s

build a team that team became known as
00:54:02.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m02s

Google brain and because things with
00:54:05.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m05s

these three properties are so incredibly
00:54:10.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m10s

powerful and so incredibly flexible you
00:54:13.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m13s

can actually see over time how many
00:54:16.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m16s

projects at Google use deep learning my
00:54:18.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m18s

graph here only goes up through a bit
00:54:23.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m23s

over a year ago but it's I know it's
00:54:25.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m25s

been continuing to grow exponentially
00:54:28.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m28s

since then as well and so what you see
00:54:29.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m29s

now is around Google that deep learning
00:54:32.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m32s

is used in like every part of the
00:54:35.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m35s

business and so it's really interesting
00:54:37.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m37s

to see how the
00:54:40.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m40s

this kind of simple idea that we can
00:54:44.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m44s

solve machine learning problems using a
00:54:47.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m47s

an algorithm that has these properties
00:54:50.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m50s

when a big company invests heavily in
00:54:53.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m53s

actually making that happen you see this
00:54:56.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m56s

incredible growth in how much it's used
00:54:59.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h54m59s

so for example if you use the inbox by
00:55:02.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m02s

Google software then when you receive an
00:55:06.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m06s

email from somebody it will often tell
00:55:09.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m09s

you here are some replies that I could
00:55:14.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m14s

send for you and so it's actually using
00:55:17.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m17s

deep learning here to read the original
00:55:19.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m19s

email and to generate some suggested
00:55:22.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m22s

replies and so like this is a really
00:55:25.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m25s

great example of the kind of stuff that
00:55:28.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m28s

previously just wasn't possible another
00:55:31.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m31s

great example would be Microsoft is also
00:55:35.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m35s

a little bit more recently invested
00:55:37.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m37s

heavily in deep learning and so now you
00:55:40.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m40s

can use Skype you can speaking to it in
00:55:42.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m42s

English and ask it at the other end to
00:55:46.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m46s

translate it in real time to Chinese or
00:55:49.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m49s

Spanish and then when they talk back to
00:55:52.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m52s

you in Chinese or Spanish Scott will in
00:55:54.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m54s

real-time translated the speech in in
00:55:57.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h55m57s

their language into English speech in
00:56:00.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m00s

real-time and again this is an example
00:56:03.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m03s

of stuff which we can only do
00:56:05.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m05s

thanks to deep learning and something is
00:56:07.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m07s

really interesting to think about how
00:56:13.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m13s

deep learning can be combined with human
00:56:14.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m14s

expertise so here's an example of low
00:56:17.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m17s

drawing something just sketching it out
00:56:20.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m20s

and then using a program called neural
00:56:22.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m22s

doodle this is from a couple of years
00:56:25.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m25s

ago - then say please take that sketch
00:56:27.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m27s

and render it in the style of an artist
00:56:30.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m30s

and so here's the picture that have been
00:56:33.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m33s

created rendering it as you know
00:56:35.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m35s

impressionist painting and I think this
00:56:38.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m38s

is a really great example of how you can
00:56:41.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m41s

use deep learning to help combine human
00:56:44.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m44s

expertise and what computers are good at
00:56:47.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m47s

so I a few years ago decided to try this
00:56:53.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m53s

myself like what would happen if I took
00:56:58.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h56m58s

think learning and tried to use it to
00:57:01.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m01s

solve a really important problem and so
00:57:04.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m04s

the problem I picked was diagnosing lung
00:57:06.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m06s

cancer it turns out if you can find lung
00:57:09.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m09s

nodules earlier there's a 10 times
00:57:14.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m14s

higher probability of survival so it's a
00:57:18.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m18s

really important problem to solve so I
00:57:21.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m21s

got together with three other people
00:57:24.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m24s

none of us had any medical background
00:57:25.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m25s

and we grabbed a data set of CT scans we
00:57:27.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m27s

used to compilation or neural network
00:57:32.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m32s

much like the dogs vs. cats one we
00:57:34.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m34s

trained at the start of today's lesson
00:57:37.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m37s

to try and predict which CT scans had
00:57:38.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m38s

malignant tumors in them and we ended up
00:57:43.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m43s

after a couple of months with something
00:57:47.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m47s

with a much lower false negative rate
00:57:49.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m49s

and a much lower false positive rate
00:57:52.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m52s

than a panel with four radiologists and
00:57:53.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m53s

we went on to build this in a start-up
00:57:56.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m56s

in just into a company called analytic
00:57:59.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h57m59s

which has really become pretty
00:58:01.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m01s

successful and since that time the idea
00:58:02.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m02s

of using deep learning for medical
00:58:06.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m06s

imaging has become hugely popular and is
00:58:08.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m08s

being used all around the world so what
00:58:11.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m11s

I've generally noticed is that you know
00:58:14.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m14s

the vast majority of of kind of things
00:58:16.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m16s

that people do in the world currently
00:58:22.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m22s

aren't using deep learning and then each
00:58:23.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m23s

time somebody says oh let's try using
00:58:26.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m26s

deep learning to improve performance at
00:58:28.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m28s

this thing they nearly always get
00:58:30.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m30s

fantastic results and then suddenly
00:58:32.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m32s

everybody in that industry starts using
00:58:34.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m34s

it as well so there's just lots and lots
00:58:36.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m36s

of opportunities here at this particular
00:58:38.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m38s

time to use deep learning to help with
00:58:41.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m41s

all kinds of different stuff so I've
00:58:44.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m44s

jotted down a few ideas here these are
00:58:46.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m46s

all things which I know you can use deep
00:58:48.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m48s

learning for right now to get good
00:58:52.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m52s

results from and you know are things
00:58:54.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m54s

which people spend a lot of money on or
00:58:58.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h58m58s

have a lot of you know important
00:59:00.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m00s

business opportunities there's lots more
00:59:02.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m02s

as well
00:59:04.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m04s

that these are some examples of things
00:59:06.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m06s

that maybe your company you could think
00:59:08.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m08s

about applying deep learning for so
00:59:09.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m09s

let's talk about what's actually going
00:59:13.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m13s

on what actually happened when we
00:59:15.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m15s

trained that deep learning model earlier
00:59:19.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m19s

and so as I briefly mentioned the thing
00:59:21.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m21s

we created is something called a
00:59:24.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m24s

convolutional neural network or CNN and
00:59:26.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m26s

the key piece of a convolutional neural
00:59:29.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m29s

network is the convolution so here's a
00:59:32.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m32s

great example from our website
00:59:36.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m36s

I've got the URL up here explained
00:59:40.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m40s

visually it's called and the explained
00:59:43.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m43s

visually website has an example of a
00:59:46.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m46s

convolution kind of in fact this over
00:59:49.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m49s

here in the bottom left is a very zoomed
00:59:52.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m52s

in picture of somebody's face and over
00:59:54.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m54s

here on the right is an example of using
00:59:57.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=00h59m57s

a convolution on that image you can see
01:00:01.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m01s

here this particular thing is obviously
01:00:05.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m05s

finding edges the edges of his head
01:00:07.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m07s

about top and bottom edges in particular
01:00:14.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m14s

now how is it doing that well if we look
01:00:16.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m16s

at each of these are all three by three
01:00:20.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m20s

areas this is moving over it's taking
01:00:22.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m22s

each three by three area of pixels and
01:00:24.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m24s

here are the pixel values right for each
01:00:26.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m26s

thing in that 3x3 area and it's
01:00:29.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m29s

multiplying each one of those 3 by 3
01:00:32.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m32s

pixels by each one of these 3 by 3
01:00:35.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m35s

kernel values in a convolution this
01:00:39.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m39s

specific set of 9 values is called a
01:00:43.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m43s

kernel it doesn't have to be 9 it could
01:00:47.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m47s

be 4 by 4 or 5 by 5 or 3 by 2 or
01:00:48.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m48s

whatever right in this case it's a 3 by
01:00:52.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m52s

3 kernel and in fact a deep learning
01:00:54.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m54s

nearly all of our kernels are 3 by 3 so
01:00:56.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h00m56s

in this case the kernel is 1 - 1 / - 1 -
01:01:00.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m00s

2 - 1 so we take each of the black
01:01:03.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m03s

through white pixel values and we
01:01:11.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m11s

multiply as you can see each of them by
01:01:13.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m13s

the corresponding value in the kernel
01:01:16.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m16s

and then we add them all together and so
01:01:18.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m18s

if you do that for every 3x3 area you
01:01:22.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m22s

end up with the values you see over here
01:01:25.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m25s

on the right hand side okay so very low
01:01:28.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m28s

values become black very high values
01:01:31.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m31s

become white and so you can see when
01:01:35.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m35s

we're at an edge where it's black at the
01:01:38.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m38s

bottom and white at the top we're
01:01:41.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m41s

obviously going to get higher numbers
01:01:44.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m44s

over here and vice versa okay so that's
01:01:46.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m46s

a convolution so as you can see it is a
01:01:50.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m50s

linear operation and so based on that
01:01:53.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m53s

definition of a neural net I described
01:01:56.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m56s

before this can be a layer in our neural
01:01:58.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h01m58s

network it is a simple linear operation
01:02:01.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m01s

and we're going to look much more at
01:02:04.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m04s

convolutions later including building a
01:02:06.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m06s

little spreadsheet that implements them
01:02:08.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m08s

ourselves
01:02:10.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m10s

so the next thing we're going to do is
01:02:11.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m11s

we're going to add a nonlinear layer so
01:02:13.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m13s

a non-linearity as it's called is
01:02:17.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m17s

something which takes an input value and
01:02:20.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m20s

turns it into some different value in a
01:02:24.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m24s

nonlinear way and you can see this
01:02:27.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m27s

orange picture here is an example of a
01:02:29.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m29s

nonlinear function specifically this is
01:02:31.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m31s

something called a sigmoid and so a
01:02:34.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m34s

sigmoid is something that has this kind
01:02:37.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m37s

of S shape and this is what we used to
01:02:39.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m39s

use as our nonlinearities in neural
01:02:41.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m41s

networks a lot actually nowadays we're
01:02:44.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m44s

nearly entirely use something else
01:02:47.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m47s

called a rally or rectified linear unit
01:02:48.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m48s

a rail u is simply take any negative
01:02:51.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m51s

numbers and replace them with 0 and
01:02:56.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m56s

leave any positive numbers as they are
01:02:58.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h02m58s

so in other words in code that would be
01:03:01.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m01s

y equals max X comma 0 so max X comma 0
01:03:05.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m05s

simply says replace the negatives with 0
01:03:11.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m11s

now regardless of whether you use a
01:03:18.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m18s

sigmoid or a RAL you or something else
01:03:21.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m21s

the key point about taking this
01:03:24.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m24s

combination of a linear layer followed
01:03:27.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m27s

by a element-wise nonlinear function is
01:03:29.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m29s

that it allows us to create arbitrarily
01:03:33.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m33s

complex shapes as you see in the bottom
01:03:35.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m35s

right and the reason why is that and
01:03:37.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m37s

this is all from Michael Nelson's
01:03:41.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m41s

neural networks and deep learning com
01:03:43.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m43s

really fantastic interactive book as you
01:03:45.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m45s

change the values of your linear
01:03:49.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m49s

functions it basically allows you to
01:03:52.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m52s

kind of like build these arbitrarily
01:03:55.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m55s

tall or thin blocks and then combine
01:03:58.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h03m58s

those blocks together and this is
01:04:01.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m01s

actually the essence of the universal
01:04:03.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m03s

approximation theorem this idea that
01:04:06.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m06s

when you have a linear layer feeding
01:04:08.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m08s

into a non-linearity you can actually
01:04:11.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m11s

create these arbitrarily complex shapes
01:04:13.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m13s

so this is the key idea behind why
01:04:15.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m15s

neural networks can solve any computable
01:04:18.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m18s

problem so then we need a way as we
01:04:22.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m22s

described to actually set these
01:04:26.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m26s

parameters so it's all very well knowing
01:04:31.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m31s

that we can move three a meters around
01:04:33.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m33s

manually to try to create different
01:04:34.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m34s

shapes but we have some specific shape
01:04:38.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m38s

we want how do we get to that shape and
01:04:40.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m40s

so as we've discussed earlier the basic
01:04:43.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m43s

idea is to use something called gradient
01:04:45.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m45s

descent this is an extract from a
01:04:47.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m47s

notebook actually one of the first AI
01:04:50.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m50s

lessons and it shows actually an example
01:04:52.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m52s

of using gradient descent to solve a
01:04:56.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h04m56s

simple linear regression problem but I
01:05:00.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m00s

can show you the basic idea let's say
01:05:03.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m03s

you were just you had a simple quadratic
01:05:06.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m06s

all right and so you are trying to find
01:05:11.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m11s

the minimum of this quadratic and so in
01:05:15.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m15s

order to find the minimum you start out
01:05:19.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m19s

by randomly picking some point all right
01:05:22.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m22s

so we say okay let's pick let's pick
01:05:24.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m24s

here and so you go up there and you
01:05:26.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m26s

calculate the value of your quadratic
01:05:28.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m28s

at that point so what you now want to do
01:05:30.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m30s

is try to find a slightly better point
01:05:33.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m33s

so what you could do is you can move a
01:05:35.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m35s

little bit to the left and a little bit
01:05:39.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m39s

to the right to find out which direction
01:05:42.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m42s

is down and what you'll find out is that
01:05:44.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m44s

moving a little bit to the left
01:05:47.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m47s

decreases the value of the function so
01:05:48.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m48s

that looks good right and so in other
01:05:51.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m51s

words we're calculating the derivative
01:05:53.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m53s

there's a function at that point right
01:05:56.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h05m56s

so that tells you which way is down it's
01:06:02.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m02s

the gradient and so now that we know
01:06:05.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m05s

that going to the left is down we can
01:06:07.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m07s

take a small step in that direction
01:06:09.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m09s

to create a new point and then we can
01:06:13.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m13s

repeat the process and say okay which
01:06:17.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m17s

way is down now and we can now take
01:06:18.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m18s

another step and another step and
01:06:20.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m20s

another step another step another step
01:06:23.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m23s

okay and each time we're getting closer
01:06:25.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m25s

and closer so the basic approach here is
01:06:28.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m28s

to say okay we start we're at some point
01:06:31.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m31s

we've got some value X which is our
01:06:34.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m34s

current guess right that's at time step
01:06:37.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m37s

n so then our new guest at time step n
01:06:40.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m40s

plus 1 is just equal to our previous
01:06:44.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m44s

guess plus the derivative
01:06:47.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m47s

right times some small number because we
01:06:56.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h06m56s

want to take a small step we need to
01:07:01.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m01s

pick a small number because if we picked
01:07:04.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m04s

a big number right then we say okay we
01:07:06.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m06s

know we want to go to the left let's
01:07:09.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m09s

jump a big long way to the left we could
01:07:11.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m11s

go all the way over here and we actually
01:07:13.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m13s

end up worse all right and then we do it
01:07:16.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m16s

again now we're even worse again right
01:07:18.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m18s

so if you have too high a step size you
01:07:21.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m21s

can actually end up with divergence
01:07:27.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m27s

rather than convergence so this number
01:07:29.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m29s

here we're going to be talking about it
01:07:32.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m32s

a lot during this course and we're going
01:07:33.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m33s

to be writing all this stuff out in code
01:07:35.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m35s

from scratch ourselves but this number
01:07:37.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m37s

here is called the learning rate okay so
01:07:39.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m39s

you can see here this is an example of
01:07:48.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m48s

basically starting out with some random
01:07:52.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m52s

line and then using gradient descent to
01:07:54.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m54s

gradually make the line better and
01:07:56.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m56s

better and better
01:07:58.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m58s

so what happens when you combine these
01:07:59.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h07m59s

ideas right the convolution the
01:08:03.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m03s

non-linearity and gradient descent
01:08:05.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m05s

because they're all tiny small simple
01:08:07.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m07s

little things it doesn't sound that
01:08:10.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m10s

exciting but if you have enough of these
01:08:11.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m11s

kernels right with enough layers
01:08:16.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m16s

something really interesting happens and
01:08:19.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m19s

we can actually draw them so here's the
01:08:22.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m22s

so this is a really interesting paper by
01:08:29.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m29s

Matt Siler and Rob Fergus and what they
01:08:32.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m32s

did a few years ago was they figured out
01:08:34.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m34s

how to basically draw a picture of what
01:08:38.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m38s

each layer in a deep learning net
01:08:40.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m40s

Network learned and so they showed that
01:08:42.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m42s

layer one of the network here are nine
01:08:46.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m46s

examples of convolutional filters from
01:08:49.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m49s

layer one of a trained network and they
01:08:52.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m52s

found that some of the filters kind of
01:08:55.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m55s

learnt these diagonal lines or simple
01:08:56.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m56s

dat or grid patterns some of them learnt
01:08:59.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h08m59s

these simple gradients right and so for
01:09:01.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m01s

each of these filters they show nine
01:09:04.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m04s

examples of little pieces
01:09:07.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m07s

of actual photos which activate that
01:09:09.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m09s

filter quite highly right so you can see
01:09:12.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m12s

layer one these learnt or ever these
01:09:15.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m15s

these are learnt using gradient descent
01:09:18.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m18s

these filters were not programmed they
01:09:20.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m20s

will learnt using gradient descent so in
01:09:23.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m23s

other words we were learning these nine
01:09:26.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m26s

numbers so layer two then was going to
01:09:31.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m31s

take these as inputs and combine them
01:09:39.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m39s

together and so layer two had you know
01:09:43.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m43s

this is like my in kind of attempts to
01:09:46.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m46s

draw one of the examples of the filters
01:09:49.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m49s

in layer two they're pretty hard to draw
01:09:51.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m51s

but what you can do is say if the each
01:09:54.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m54s

filter what are examples of little bits
01:09:56.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m56s

of images that activated them and you
01:09:59.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h09m59s

can see by layer two we've got basically
01:10:01.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m01s

something that's being activated nearly
01:10:04.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m04s

entirely by little bits of sunset some
01:10:06.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m06s

things that's being activated by
01:10:09.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m09s

circular objects something that's being
01:10:10.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m10s

activated by repeating horizontal lines
01:10:14.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m14s

something that's being activated by
01:10:17.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m17s

corners so you can see how we're
01:10:19.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m19s

basically combining layer one features
01:10:22.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m22s

together so if we combine those features
01:10:24.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m24s

together and again these are all
01:10:27.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m27s

convolutional filters won't through
01:10:29.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m29s

gradient descent by the third layer it's
01:10:31.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m31s

actually learn to recognize the presence
01:10:34.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m34s

of text another filter has learnt to
01:10:37.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m37s

recognize the presence of petals another
01:10:40.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m40s

filter has learnt to recognize the
01:10:43.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m43s

presence of human faces right so just
01:10:45.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m45s

three layers is enough to get some
01:10:48.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m48s

pretty rich behavior so but by the time
01:10:50.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m50s

we get to layer five we've got something
01:10:53.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m53s

that can recognize the eyeballs of
01:10:56.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m56s

insects and birds and something that can
01:10:58.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h10m58s

recognize unicycle wheels alright so so
01:11:01.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m01s

this is kind of where we start with
01:11:05.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m05s

something incredibly simple right but if
01:11:07.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m07s

we use it as a big enough scale thanks
01:11:12.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m12s

to the universal approximation theorem
01:11:15.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m15s

and the use of multiple hidden layers in
01:11:17.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m17s

deep learning we actually get the
01:11:20.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m20s

very very rich capabilities so that is
01:11:23.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m23s

what we used when we actually trained
01:11:28.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m28s

our little dog vs cat recognizer okay so
01:11:32.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m32s

let's talk more about this dog vs cat
01:11:40.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m40s

recognizer
01:11:44.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m44s

so we've learnt the idea of like we can
01:11:45.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m45s

look at the pictures that come out of
01:11:48.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m48s

the other end to see what the model is
01:11:49.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m49s

classifying well like as I find badly or
01:11:50.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m50s

which ones it's unsure about but let's
01:11:53.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m53s

talk about like this key thing I
01:11:56.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m56s

mentioned which is the learning rate so
01:11:59.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h11m59s

I mentioned we have to set this thing I
01:12:01.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m01s

just caught it L before the learning
01:12:03.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m03s

rate and you might have noticed there's
01:12:05.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m05s

a couple of numbers these kind of magic
01:12:07.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m07s

numbers here the first one is the
01:12:09.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m09s

learning rate right so this number is
01:12:13.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m13s

how much do you want to multiply the
01:12:15.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m15s

gradient by when you're taking each step
01:12:17.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m17s

in your gradient descent we already
01:12:19.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m19s

talked about why you wouldn't want it to
01:12:24.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m24s

be too high right but probably also it's
01:12:25.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m25s

obvious to see why you wouldn't want it
01:12:29.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m29s

to be too low if you had it too low you
01:12:31.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m31s

would take like a little step and you'd
01:12:35.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m35s

be a little bit closer and little bits
01:12:37.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m37s

too little step little step and it would
01:12:39.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m39s

take lots and lots and lots of steps and
01:12:41.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m41s

it would take too long so setting this
01:12:43.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m43s

number well is actually really important
01:12:46.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m46s

and for the longest time this was
01:12:49.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m49s

driving deep learning researchers crazy
01:12:52.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m52s

because they didn't really know a good
01:12:55.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m55s

way to set this reliably so the good
01:12:59.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h12m59s

news is last year a researcher came up
01:13:02.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m02s

with an approach to quite reliably set
01:13:07.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m07s

the learning rate unfortunately almost
01:13:10.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m10s

nobody noticed so almost no deep
01:13:13.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m13s

learning researchers I know about
01:13:16.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m16s

actually are aware of this approach but
01:13:18.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m18s

it's incredibly successful and it's
01:13:21.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m21s

incredibly simple and I'll show you the
01:13:22.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m22s

idea right it's built into the fast AI
01:13:25.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m25s

library as something called @lr find or
01:13:27.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m27s

the learning rate finder and it comes
01:13:29.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m29s

from this paper I was actually 2015
01:13:32.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m32s

paper sorry
01:13:34.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m34s

cyclic or learning rates for training
01:13:36.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m36s

neural networks by a terrific researcher
01:13:37.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m37s

called
01:13:39.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m39s

Leslie Smith and I'll show you Leslie's
01:13:40.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m40s

idea
01:13:43.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m43s

so Leslie's ideas started out with the
01:13:47.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m47s

same basic idea that we've seen before
01:13:50.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m50s

which is if we're going to optimize
01:13:53.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m53s

something pick some random point take
01:13:55.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m55s

its gradient all right and then
01:13:58.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h13m58s

specifically he said take a tiny tiny
01:14:02.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m02s

step like tiny step so a learning rate
01:14:05.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m05s

of like 10 e next seven all right and
01:14:10.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m10s

then do it again again but each time
01:14:12.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m12s

increase the learning rate like double
01:14:15.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m15s

it so then we try like to wean X 7 14 X
01:14:18.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m18s

7 18 X 7 10 in X 6 right and so
01:14:21.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m21s

gradually your steps are getting bigger
01:14:26.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m26s

and bigger right and so you can see
01:14:30.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m30s

what's going to happen it's gonna like
01:14:35.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m35s

start doing almost nothing right and
01:14:36.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m36s

it's going to then suddenly the loss
01:14:39.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m39s

function is going to improve very
01:14:41.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m41s

quickly right but then it's going to
01:14:43.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m43s

step even further again and then even
01:14:45.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m45s

further again all right
01:14:50.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m50s

let's draw the rest of that line to be
01:14:53.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m53s

clear all right and so suddenly it's
01:14:55.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h14m55s

then going to shoot off and get much
01:15:01.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m01s

worse right so the idea then is to go
01:15:02.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m02s

back and say okay at what point did we
01:15:09.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m09s

see like the best improvement so here
01:15:17.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m17s

we've got our best improvement right and
01:15:26.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m26s

so I would say ok let's use that
01:15:29.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m29s

learning rate right so in other words if
01:15:32.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m32s

we were to plot the learning rate over
01:15:35.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m35s

time
01:15:41.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m41s

it was increasing like so alright and so
01:15:42.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m42s

what we then want to do is we want to
01:15:48.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m48s

plot the learning rate against the loss
01:15:50.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m50s

right so when I say the loss I basically
01:15:54.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m54s

mean like how accurate is the model how
01:15:56.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m56s

close in this case the loss would be how
01:15:59.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h15m59s

far away is the predictive prediction
01:16:02.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m02s

from the from the goal okay and so if we
01:16:05.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m05s

plotted the learning rate against the
01:16:09.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m09s

loss we'd say like okay initially it
01:16:11.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m11s

didn't do very much right for small
01:16:14.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m14s

learning rates and then it suddenly
01:16:17.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m17s

improved a lot and then it suddenly got
01:16:18.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m18s

a lot worse so that's the basic idea and
01:16:22.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m22s

so we'd be looking for the point where
01:16:25.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m25s

this graph is dropping quickly right
01:16:28.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m28s

we're not looking for its minimum point
01:16:31.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m31s

we're not saying like where was it the
01:16:33.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m33s

lowest because that could actually be
01:16:34.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m34s

the point where it's just jumped too far
01:16:36.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m36s

we want at what point was it dropping
01:16:38.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m38s

the fastest so if you go so if you
01:16:40.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m40s

create your learn object in the same way
01:16:48.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m48s

that we did before we'll be learning
01:16:50.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m50s

more about this these details shortly if
01:16:51.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m51s

you then call LR find method on that
01:16:54.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m54s

you'll see that it'll start training a
01:16:57.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h16m57s

model like it did before but it'll
01:17:00.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m00s

generally stop before it gets to 100%
01:17:03.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m03s

okay because if it notices that the loss
01:17:06.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m06s

is getting a lot worse then it'll stop
01:17:10.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m10s

automatically that's what you can see
01:17:14.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m14s

here it stopped at 84% and so then you
01:17:15.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m15s

can call one said that gets you the
01:17:18.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m18s

learning rate scheduler that's the
01:17:21.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m21s

object which actually does this learning
01:17:23.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m23s

rate finding and that object has a plot
01:17:25.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m25s

learning rate function and so you can
01:17:27.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m27s

see here over by iteration you can see
01:17:29.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m29s

the learning rate alright so you can see
01:17:32.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m32s

each step the learning rate is getting
01:17:34.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m34s

bigger and bigger you can do it this way
01:17:36.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m36s

we can see it's increasing exponentially
01:17:40.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m40s

another way that Leslie Smith the
01:17:42.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m42s

researcher suggests is to do it linearly
01:17:44.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m44s

so I'm actually currently researching
01:17:47.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m47s

with both of these approaches to see
01:17:49.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m49s

which works best recently I've been
01:17:50.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m50s

mainly using exponential but I'm
01:17:53.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m53s

starting to look more
01:17:55.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m55s

using Linea at the moment and so if we
01:17:56.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m56s

then call shed but plot that does the
01:17:59.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h17m59s

plot that I just described down here
01:18:02.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m02s

learning rate versus loss all right and
01:18:04.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m04s

so we're looking for the highest
01:18:08.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m08s

learning rate we can find where the loss
01:18:10.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m10s

is still improving clearly well right
01:18:14.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m14s

and so in this case I would say 10 to
01:18:17.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m17s

the negative 2x that 10 to the negative
01:18:22.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m22s

1 it's not improving right 10 to the
01:18:23.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m23s

negative 3
01:18:27.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m27s

it is also improving but I'm trying to
01:18:27.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m27s

find the highest learning rate I can or
01:18:29.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m29s

it's still clearly improving so I'd say
01:18:32.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m32s

10 to the negative 2 okay so you might
01:18:33.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m33s

have noticed that when we ran our model
01:18:36.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m36s

before we had 10 to the negative to 0.01
01:18:38.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m38s

so that's why we picked that learning
01:18:44.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m44s

rate so there's really only one other
01:18:45.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m45s

number that we have to pick and that was
01:18:51.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m51s

this number three and so that number
01:18:57.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h18m57s

three controlled how many epochs did we
01:19:00.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m00s

run so an epoch means going through our
01:19:04.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m04s

entire data set of images and using each
01:19:08.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m08s

each time we do a bunch of they're
01:19:12.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m12s

called mini batches we grab like 64
01:19:15.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m15s

images at a time and use them to try to
01:19:18.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m18s

improve the model a little bit using
01:19:21.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m21s

gradient descent right and using all of
01:19:22.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m22s

the images once is called one epoch and
01:19:24.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m24s

so at the end of each epoch we print out
01:19:28.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m28s

the accuracy and validation and training
01:19:31.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m31s

loss at the end of the epoch so the
01:19:35.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m35s

question of how many epochs should be
01:19:40.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m40s

run is kind of the one other question
01:19:43.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m43s

that you need to answer to run these
01:19:45.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m45s

three lines of code and the answer
01:19:47.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m47s

really to me is like as many as you like
01:19:50.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m50s

what you might find happen is if you run
01:19:54.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m54s

it for too long the accuracy you'll
01:19:58.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h19m58s

start getting worse all right and we'll
01:20:00.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m00s

learn about that why later it's
01:20:03.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m03s

something called overfitting right so
01:20:04.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m04s

you can run it for a while run lots of
01:20:06.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m06s

epochs
01:20:09.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m09s

once you see it getting worse you know
01:20:10.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m10s

how many epochs you can run and the
01:20:12.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m12s

other thing that might happen is if
01:20:14.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m14s

you've got like a really big model or a
01:20:16.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m16s

lot lots and lots of data maybe it takes
01:20:18.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m18s

so long you don't have time and so you
01:20:19.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m19s

just run enough epochs that fit into the
01:20:21.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m21s

time you have available so the number of
01:20:25.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m25s

epochs you run you know that's a pretty
01:20:26.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m26s

easy thing to set so there are the only
01:20:28.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m28s

two numbers you're gonna have to see it
01:20:31.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m31s

and so the goal this week will be to
01:20:33.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m33s

make sure that you can run not only
01:20:37.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m37s

these three lines of code on the data
01:20:40.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m40s

that I provided but to run it on a set
01:20:42.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m42s

of images that you either have on your
01:20:46.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m46s

computer or that you get from work well
01:20:49.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m49s

that you download from Google and like
01:20:52.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m52s

try to get a sense of like which kinds
01:20:54.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m54s

of images this is seem to work well for
01:20:57.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h20m57s

which ones doesn't it work well for what
01:21:00.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m00s

kind of learning rates do you need for
01:21:04.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m04s

different kinds of images how many
01:21:06.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m06s

epochs do you need how does the number
01:21:08.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m08s

of the learning rate change the accuracy
01:21:10.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m10s

you get and so forth like really
01:21:12.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m12s

experiment and then you know try to get
01:21:14.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m14s

a sense of like what's inside this data
01:21:18.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m18s

object you know what are the y-values
01:21:20.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m20s

look like what are these places mean if
01:21:22.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m22s

you're not familiar with numpy you know
01:21:25.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m25s

really practice a lot with numpy so that
01:21:27.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m27s

by the time you come back for the next
01:21:30.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m30s

lesson
01:21:31.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m31s

you know we're going to be digging into
01:21:33.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m33s

a lot more detail and so you'll really
01:21:35.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m35s

feel ready to do that now one thing
01:21:37.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m37s

that's really important to be able to do
01:21:40.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m40s

that is that you need to really know how
01:21:42.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m42s

to work with numpy the faster a library
01:21:44.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m44s

and so forth and so I want to show you
01:21:50.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m50s

some tricks in Jupiter notebook to make
01:21:52.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m52s

that much easier so one trick to be
01:21:54.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m54s

aware of is if you can't quite remember
01:21:58.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h21m58s

how to spell something right so if
01:22:00.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m00s

you're not quite sure what the method
01:22:03.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m03s

you want is you can always hit tab and
01:22:06.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m06s

you'll get a list of methods that start
01:22:08.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m08s

with that letter right and so that's a
01:22:12.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m12s

quick way to find things
01:22:13.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m13s

if you then can't remember what the
01:22:15.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m15s

arguments are to a method hit shift tab
01:22:16.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m16s

all right so hitting shift tab tells you
01:22:21.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m21s

the arguments to the method so shift tab
01:22:24.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m24s

is like one of the most helpful things I
01:22:27.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m27s

know so let's take in P X P shift tab
01:22:29.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m29s

and so now you might be wondering like
01:22:36.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m36s

okay well what does this function do and
01:22:39.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m39s

how does it work if you press shift tab
01:22:41.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m41s

twice then it actually brings up the
01:22:44.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m44s

documentation shows you what the
01:22:47.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m47s

parameters are and shows you what it
01:22:49.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m49s

returns and gives you examples okay if
01:22:51.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m51s

you press it three times then it
01:22:57.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h22m57s

actually pops up a whole little separate
01:23:00.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m00s

window with that information
01:23:01.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m01s

okay so shift tab is super helpful one
01:23:03.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m03s

way to grab that window straight away is
01:23:07.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m07s

if you just put question mark at the
01:23:09.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m09s

start then it just brings up that little
01:23:12.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m12s

documentation window now the other thing
01:23:15.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m15s

to be aware of is increasingly during
01:23:19.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m19s

this course we're going to be looking at
01:23:22.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m22s

the actual source code of fast AI itself
01:23:23.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m23s

and learning how it's built and why it's
01:23:25.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m25s

built that way it's really helpful to
01:23:28.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m28s

look at source code in order to you know
01:23:31.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m31s

understand what you can do and how you
01:23:33.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m33s

can do it so if you for example wanted
01:23:36.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m36s

to look at the source code for learned I
01:23:38.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m38s

predict you can just put two question
01:23:40.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m40s

marks okay and you can see it's popped
01:23:42.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m42s

up the source code right and so it's
01:23:46.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m46s

just a single line of code
01:23:49.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m49s

you're very often find that fast AI
01:23:50.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m50s

methods like they they're designed to
01:23:52.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m52s

never be more than about half a screen
01:23:55.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m55s

full of code and they're often under six
01:23:59.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h23m59s

lines so you can see this case it's
01:24:01.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m01s

calling predicted with tags so we could
01:24:02.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m02s

then get the source code for that in the
01:24:05.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m05s

same way okay and then that's calling a
01:24:06.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m06s

function called predicted with tags so
01:24:12.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m12s

we could get that documentation for that
01:24:14.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m14s

in the same way and then so here yeah
01:24:15.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m15s

and then finally that's what it does it
01:24:17.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m17s

either rates through a data loader gets
01:24:19.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m19s

the predictions and then passes them
01:24:21.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m21s

back and so forth okay so question mark
01:24:23.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m23s

question mark is how to get source code
01:24:27.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m27s

but the single question mark is how to
01:24:30.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m30s

get documentation
01:24:32.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m32s

and shift-tab is how to bring up
01:24:34.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m34s

parameters or press it more times to get
01:24:36.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m36s

the docs so that's really helpful
01:24:39.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m39s

another really helpful thing to know
01:24:42.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m42s

about is how to use Jupiter notebook
01:24:44.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m44s

well and the button that you want to
01:24:47.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m47s

know is H if you press H it will bring
01:24:49.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m49s

up the keyboard shortcuts palette and so
01:24:53.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m53s

now you can see exactly what Jupiter
01:24:56.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m56s

notebook can do and how to do it I
01:24:58.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h24m58s

personally find all of these functions
01:25:01.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m01s

useful so I generally tell students to
01:25:02.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m02s

try and learn four or five different
01:25:05.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m05s

keyboard shortcuts a day try them out
01:25:07.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m07s

see what they do see how they work and
01:25:10.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m10s

then you can try practicing in that
01:25:12.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m12s

session and one very important thing to
01:25:14.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m14s

remember when you're finished with your
01:25:17.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m17s

work for the day go back to a paper
01:25:19.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m19s

space and click on that little button
01:25:21.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m21s

which stops and starts the machine so
01:25:23.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m23s

after it's stopped
01:25:26.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBSB1HLNLo#t=01h25m26s

you'll see it says connection closed and
