[so we've looked at a lot of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m00s)
00:00:00

[random and random forest interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m05s)
00:00:05

[techniques and a question that's come up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m08s)
00:00:08

[a little bit on the forums is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m14s)
00:00:14

[what are these for really like like how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m17s)
00:00:17

[do these help me get a better score on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m21s)
00:00:21

[cattle and my answers kind of been like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m23s)
00:00:23

[they don't necessarily and so I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m26s)
00:00:26

[talk more about like why do we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m29s)
00:00:29

[machine learning like what's the point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m33s)
00:00:33

[and to answer this question I'm gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m37s)
00:00:37

[put this PowerPoint in the github repo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m43s)
00:00:43

[so you can have a look I want to show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m45s)
00:00:45

[you something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m48s)
00:00:48

[really important which is examples of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m51s)
00:00:51

[how people have used machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m54s)
00:00:54

[mainly in business because that's where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h00m57s)
00:00:57

[most of you are probably going to end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m02s)
00:01:02

[after this is working for some company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m03s)
00:01:03

[I'm going to show you a plication zuv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m06s)
00:01:06

[machine learning which are either based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m08s)
00:01:08

[on things that I've been personally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m10s)
00:01:10

[involved in myself or know of people who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m11s)
00:01:11

[are doing them directly so these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m13s)
00:01:13

[none of these are going to be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m15s)
00:01:15

[hypotheticals these are all actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m18s)
00:01:18

[things that people are doing and I'm got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m20s)
00:01:20

[direct or secondhand knowledge of I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m23s)
00:01:23

[going to split them into two groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m27s)
00:01:27

[horizontal and vertical so in business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m28s)
00:01:28

[horizontal means something that you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m30s)
00:01:30

[like across different kinds of business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m34s)
00:01:34

[whereas vertical means that something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m37s)
00:01:37

[that you do within you know within a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m39s)
00:01:39

[business or within a supply chain or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m42s)
00:01:42

[within a process so in other words an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m44s)
00:01:44

[example of horizontal applications is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[everything involving marketing so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m51s)
00:01:51

[every company pretty much has to try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m54s)
00:01:54

[sell more products to its customers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h01m57s)
00:01:57

[so therefore does marketing and so each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m00s)
00:02:00

[of these boxes are examples of some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m02s)
00:02:02

[the things that people are using machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m05s)
00:02:05

[learning for in marketing so let's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m07s)
00:02:07

[an example all right let's take Chen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[okay so Chen refers to a model which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m17s)
00:02:17

[attempts to predict who's going to leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m23s)
00:02:23

[that's why I've done some churn modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m26s)
00:02:26

[fairly recently in in telecommunications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m28s)
00:02:28

[and so we're trying to figure out this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m31s)
00:02:31

[big cellphone company which customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m33s)
00:02:33

[are going to leave that is not of itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m35s)
00:02:35

[that interesting like building a highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m40s)
00:02:40

[predictive predictive model that says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m43s)
00:02:43

[Jeremy how it is almost certainly going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[to leave next month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m49s)
00:02:49

[is probably not that helpful because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m51s)
00:02:51

[like if I'm almost certainly going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m53s)
00:02:53

[leave next month there's probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m55s)
00:02:55

[nothing you can do about it but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m56s)
00:02:56

[it's too late what could have cost you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h02m58s)
00:02:58

[too much to keep me right so in order to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m00s)
00:03:00

[understand like or why would we do churn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m03s)
00:03:03

[modeling I've got a little framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m06s)
00:03:06

[that you might find helpful so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m09s)
00:03:09

[google for Jeremy Howard data products I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m11s)
00:03:11

[think I've mentioned this thing before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[there's a paper you can find designing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[great data products that I wrote with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m21s)
00:03:21

[couple of colleagues a few years ago and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m23s)
00:03:23

[in it I describe my experience of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[actually turning machine learning models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m31s)
00:03:31

[into like stuff that makes money right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m34s)
00:03:34

[and the basic trick is this thing I call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m37s)
00:03:37

[the drive train approach which is which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m40s)
00:03:40

[is these four steps the starting point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m46s)
00:03:46

[to actually turn a machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m50s)
00:03:50

[project into something that's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m53s)
00:03:53

[useful is to know what am I trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m54s)
00:03:54

[achieve and that doesn't mean like I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m57s)
00:03:57

[trying to achieve a high area under the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h03m59s)
00:03:59

[ROC curve around trying to achieve a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m02s)
00:04:02

[large difference between classes no it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m05s)
00:04:05

[would be I'm trying to sell more books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[or I'm trying to reduce the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m12s)
00:04:12

[customers that leave next month or I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m16s)
00:04:16

[trying to detect lung cancer earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m18s)
00:04:18

[right these are things that these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m22s)
00:04:22

[objectives so the objective is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m24s)
00:04:24

[that absolutely directly is the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m26s)
00:04:26

[that the the company or the organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m29s)
00:04:29

[actually wants no company or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m30s)
00:04:30

[organization lives in order to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m33s)
00:04:33

[you know a more accurate predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m36s)
00:04:36

[model but there's some reason right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m40s)
00:04:40

[that's your objective now that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m43s)
00:04:43

[obviously the most important thing if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m46s)
00:04:46

[you don't know the purpose of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m47s)
00:04:47

[you're modeling for then you can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m48s)
00:04:48

[possibly do a good job of it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m50s)
00:04:50

[hopefully people are starting to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m52s)
00:04:52

[know pick that up in out there in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m54s)
00:04:54

[world of data science but interestingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m56s)
00:04:56

[what very few people are talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h04m58s)
00:04:58

[but it's just as important as the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m00s)
00:05:00

[thing which is levers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m02s)
00:05:02

[lever is a thing that the organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m05s)
00:05:05

[can do to actually drive the objective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m07s)
00:05:07

[so let's take the example of churn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m10s)
00:05:10

[modeling right what is a lever that an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m12s)
00:05:12

[organization could use to reduce the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m16s)
00:05:16

[number of customers that are leaving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m20s)
00:05:20

[they could look take a closer look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m26s)
00:05:26

[the model and do some of this random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m28s)
00:05:28

[forest interpretation and see some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m30s)
00:05:30

[the causes that are causing people to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m33s)
00:05:33

[leave and potentially change those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[issues in the company okay so that's it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m38s)
00:05:38

[that's a data scientist answer but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m41s)
00:05:41

[want you to go to the next level what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m43s)
00:05:43

[are the things that levers are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m44s)
00:05:44

[things they can do you want to put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m46s)
00:05:46

[past behind you what are the things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m47s)
00:05:47

[they can do just reach like calling or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m49s)
00:05:49

[else they could call someone and say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m52s)
00:05:52

[like are you happy anything we could do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[okay yeah so they could like give them a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m00s)
00:06:00

[free pen or something if they you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m08s)
00:06:08

[buy 20 bucks worth of product next month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m12s)
00:06:12

[yep you are going to do that as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m16s)
00:06:16

[okay so you guys you guys are the giving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m19s)
00:06:19

[out carrots rather than the handing out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m21s)
00:06:21

[sticks you know over in a couple of yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m23s)
00:06:23

[special all right so these are levers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m34s)
00:06:34

[right and so whenever you're working as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m36s)
00:06:36

[a data scientist you know keep coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m39s)
00:06:39

[back and thinking what are we trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m41s)
00:06:41

[achieve we being the organization and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m43s)
00:06:43

[how we try to achieve it being like what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m46s)
00:06:46

[are the actual things we can do to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m48s)
00:06:48

[that objective happen so building a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m51s)
00:06:51

[model is never ever a lever okay but it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m55s)
00:06:55

[could help you with the lever so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h06m59s)
00:06:59

[the next step is what data does the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m03s)
00:07:03

[organization have that could possibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m06s)
00:07:06

[help them to set that lever to achieve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m09s)
00:07:09

[that objective right and so this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m11s)
00:07:11

[what data did they give you when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m14s)
00:07:14

[started the project right but like think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m17s)
00:07:17

[about it from a first principles point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m20s)
00:07:20

[of view okay I'm working for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m22s)
00:07:22

[telecommunications company they gave me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m23s)
00:07:23

[some certain set of data but I'm sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m25s)
00:07:25

[they must know where their customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m27s)
00:07:27

[live how many phone calls they made last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m30s)
00:07:30

[month how many times they call customer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m32s)
00:07:32

[service whatever like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m34s)
00:07:34

[so have a think about like okay if we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m36s)
00:07:36

[trying to decide like who should we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m39s)
00:07:39

[reduce the you know give a special offer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m43s)
00:07:43

[to proactively then we want to figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m44s)
00:07:44

[out like what information do we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m49s)
00:07:49

[that might help us to identify who's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m51s)
00:07:51

[going to react well or badly to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m53s)
00:07:53

[perhaps more interestingly would be what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h07m56s)
00:07:56

[if we were doing like a fraud algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m00s)
00:08:00

[right and so we're trying to figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m03s)
00:08:03

[like who's going to like not pay for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m05s)
00:08:05

[phone that they take out of the store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[you know that they once on 12-month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m09s)
00:08:09

[payment plan we never see them again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m11s)
00:08:11

[now in that case the data we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[available it doesn't matter what's in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m15s)
00:08:15

[the database what matters is what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m17s)
00:08:17

[data that we can get when the custom is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m18s)
00:08:18

[in the shop right so there's often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[constraints around the data that we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m23s)
00:08:23

[actually use so we need to know what am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m26s)
00:08:26

[I trying to achieve what can I actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m30s)
00:08:30

[what can this organization actually do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m33s)
00:08:33

[specifically to change that outcome and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m35s)
00:08:35

[at the point that that decision is being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m37s)
00:08:37

[made what data do they have or could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m40s)
00:08:40

[they collect right and so then the way I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m42s)
00:08:42

[put that all together is with a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m46s)
00:08:46

[and this is not a model in the sense of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m49s)
00:08:49

[a predictive model but it's a model in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[the sense of a simulation model so one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m53s)
00:08:53

[of the main examples I gave in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m56s)
00:08:56

[paper is when I spent many years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m57s)
00:08:57

[building which is if an insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h08m59s)
00:08:59

[company changes their prices how does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m01s)
00:09:01

[that impact their profitability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m06s)
00:09:06

[right and so generally your simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m07s)
00:09:07

[model contains a number of predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[models so I had for example a predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m12s)
00:09:12

[model called an elasticity model that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m15s)
00:09:15

[said for a specific customer if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m17s)
00:09:17

[charge them a specific price for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m19s)
00:09:19

[specific product what's the probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m21s)
00:09:21

[that they would say yes both when it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m23s)
00:09:23

[new business and then a year later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[what's the probability that they're good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m28s)
00:09:28

[new and then there's another predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m30s)
00:09:30

[model which is what's the probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m33s)
00:09:33

[that they're going to make a claim and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m35s)
00:09:35

[how much is that plan going to be right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[and so like you can combine these models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m40s)
00:09:40

[together then to say all right if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m42s)
00:09:42

[changed our pricing by reducing it by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m44s)
00:09:44

[10% for everybody through body between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[18 and 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m47s)
00:09:47

[and we can run it through these models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[that combined together into a simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m51s)
00:09:51

[than the overall impact on our market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[share in ten years time is X and our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m54s)
00:09:54

[cost is y and our profit is Z and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m56s)
00:09:56

[forth right so in practice most of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h09m59s)
00:09:59

[time you really are going to care more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m05s)
00:10:05

[about kind of the results of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m09s)
00:10:09

[simulation than you do about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m10s)
00:10:10

[predictive model directly but most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m13s)
00:10:13

[people are not doing this effectively at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m16s)
00:10:16

[the moment so for example when I go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m18s)
00:10:18

[Amazon right I read all of Douglas Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m22s)
00:10:22

[as books right and so having read all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m25s)
00:10:25

[with Douglas Evans's books the next time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m28s)
00:10:28

[I went to Amazon they said would you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m30s)
00:10:30

[like to buy the collected works of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m33s)
00:10:33

[Douglas Adams this is after I had bought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m35s)
00:10:35

[every one of his books so like from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m38s)
00:10:38

[machine learning point of view some some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m41s)
00:10:41

[data scientist had said oh people that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m43s)
00:10:43

[buy one of Douglas Adams as books often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m46s)
00:10:46

[go on to buy the collected works right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[but recommending to me that I buy the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m52s)
00:10:52

[collected works of Douglas Adams isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m55s)
00:10:55

[smart that and it's actually not smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h10m58s)
00:10:58

[at a number of levels like not only is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m00s)
00:11:00

[unlikely to buy a box set of something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m03s)
00:11:03

[of which I have everyone individually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m05s)
00:11:05

[but furthermore it's not going to change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m06s)
00:11:06

[my buying behavior like I already know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m08s)
00:11:08

[about Douglas Adams I already know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m11s)
00:11:11

[like him so taking up your valuable web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m13s)
00:11:13

[space to tell me hey maybe you should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m16s)
00:11:16

[buy more of the author who you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m18s)
00:11:18

[already familiar with in the port lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m20s)
00:11:20

[of times isn't actually going to change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m22s)
00:11:22

[my behavior right so what if instead of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m24s)
00:11:24

[creating a predictive model Amazon had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m27s)
00:11:27

[built an optimization model that said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m30s)
00:11:30

[like that could simulate and said if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m33s)
00:11:33

[show Jeremy this ad how likely is he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m35s)
00:11:35

[then to go on to buy this book and if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m38s)
00:11:38

[don't show him this ad how likely is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m41s)
00:11:41

[here to go on to buy this book and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m43s)
00:11:43

[that's the counterfactual right the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m46s)
00:11:46

[counterfactual is what would have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m48s)
00:11:48

[happened otherwise and then you can take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m50s)
00:11:50

[the difference and say okay what should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m52s)
00:11:52

[we recommend him that is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m54s)
00:11:54

[maximally change his behavior so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m57s)
00:11:57

[maximally result in more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h11m59s)
00:11:59

[books and so you'd probably say like oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m01s)
00:12:01

[he's never bought me terry pratchet box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m04s)
00:12:04

[he probably doesn't know about terry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m07s)
00:12:07

[pratchet but like lots of people that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m08s)
00:12:08

[like to douglas adams's did turn out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m10s)
00:12:10

[like terry pratchett so let's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[introduce him to a new author right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m14s)
00:12:14

[it's the difference between a predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m17s)
00:12:17

[model on the one hand versus an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m18s)
00:12:18

[optimization model on the other hand so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m20s)
00:12:20

[the two tend to go hand in hand right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m23s)
00:12:23

[the optimization model basically is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m26s)
00:12:26

[saying well first of all we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m28s)
00:12:28

[simulation model right the simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m33s)
00:12:33

[model is saying in a world where we put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m35s)
00:12:35

[terry pratchett's book on the front page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m39s)
00:12:39

[of amazon for Jeremy Howard this is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m41s)
00:12:41

[would have happened he would have bought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m44s)
00:12:44

[it with a money four percent probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m46s)
00:12:46

[right and so that then tells us with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m48s)
00:12:48

[this lever of like what do I put on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m53s)
00:12:53

[there on my homepage for Jeremy today we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h12m56s)
00:12:56

[say okay well the different settings of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m00s)
00:13:00

[that lever that put Terry Patchett on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m01s)
00:13:01

[the homepage has the highest simulated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m03s)
00:13:03

[outcome right and then that's the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m05s)
00:13:05

[which maximizes our profit from Jeremy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m08s)
00:13:08

[visit to amazon.com today okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m12s)
00:13:12

[generally speaking your predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[models kind of feed in to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m18s)
00:13:18

[simulation model but you kind of got to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[think about like how do they all work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m22s)
00:13:22

[together so for example let's go back to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m24s)
00:13:24

[churn right so I'd turn out that Jeremy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[Howard is very likely to leave his cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m31s)
00:13:31

[phone company next month what are we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m34s)
00:13:34

[gonna do about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m37s)
00:13:37

[oh let's call him right and I can tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m38s)
00:13:38

[you if my cell phone company calls me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m41s)
00:13:41

[right now and says just calling to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m43s)
00:13:43

[we love you I'd be like I'm cancelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m46s)
00:13:46

[right now like like that would be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m49s)
00:13:49

[terrible idea so again you would want a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m52s)
00:13:52

[simulation model that says like what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m54s)
00:13:54

[the probability that Jeremy is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m57s)
00:13:57

[change his behavior as a result of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h13m59s)
00:13:59

[calling him right now right so elite one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m00s)
00:14:00

[of the levers I have is call him on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m02s)
00:14:02

[other hand if I like got a piece of mail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m05s)
00:14:05

[tomorrow that said like for each month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m08s)
00:14:08

[you stay with us we're going to give you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m11s)
00:14:11

[a hundred thousand dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m12s)
00:14:12

[okay then that's going to definitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m14s)
00:14:14

[change my behavior right so but then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m16s)
00:14:16

[feeding that into the simulation model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m20s)
00:14:20

[it turns out that overall that would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m22s)
00:14:22

[an unprofitable choice to make so do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m24s)
00:14:24

[see how this fits in together all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[so so when we look at something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m28s)
00:14:28

[churn we want to be thinking like what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m37s)
00:14:37

[are the levers we can pull right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[what are the kind of models that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m43s)
00:14:43

[could build with what kinds of data to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m45s)
00:14:45

[help us pull those levers better to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m47s)
00:14:47

[achieve our objectives and so when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m50s)
00:14:50

[think about it that way you realize that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m52s)
00:14:52

[the vast majority of these applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m54s)
00:14:54

[are not largely about a predictive model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[at all they're about interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h14m59s)
00:14:59

[they're about understanding what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m02s)
00:15:02

[if right so if we kind of take the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[cross-product or not the cross-product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[or either inter intersection between on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m10s)
00:15:10

[the one hand here are all the levers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m13s)
00:15:13

[that we could pull like here or all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m15s)
00:15:15

[things we can do and then here are all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[of the features from our random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m19s)
00:15:19

[feature importance that turn out to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m21s)
00:15:21

[strong drivers of the outcome and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m23s)
00:15:23

[then the intersection of those is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m26s)
00:15:26

[are the levers we could pull that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m28s)
00:15:28

[actually matter right because if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m30s)
00:15:30

[can't change the thing that is not very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m33s)
00:15:33

[interesting and if it's not actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m36s)
00:15:36

[significant driver it's not very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m39s)
00:15:39

[interesting right so we can actually use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m41s)
00:15:41

[our random forest feature importance to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[tell us what can we actually do to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[a difference and then we can use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m49s)
00:15:49

[partial dependence to actually build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m52s)
00:15:52

[this kind of simulation model to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m54s)
00:15:54

[like okay well if we did change that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m56s)
00:15:56

[what would happen okay so you know there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h15m58s)
00:15:58

[are examples lots and lots of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m05s)
00:16:05

[vertical examples and so what I want you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m06s)
00:16:06

[to kind of think about as you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m08s)
00:16:08

[about the machine learning problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m11s)
00:16:11

[you're working on is like why does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m12s)
00:16:12

[somebody care about this right and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m15s)
00:16:15

[what would a good answer to them look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m18s)
00:16:18

[like and how could you you know how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m21s)
00:16:21

[could you actually positively impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m23s)
00:16:23

[this business so if you're creating like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m24s)
00:16:24

[a Keagle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[you know try to think about from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m28s)
00:16:28

[point of view of the competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m31s)
00:16:31

[organizer like what would they want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m33s)
00:16:33

[know and how can you give them that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m35s)
00:16:35

[information so something like fraud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m37s)
00:16:37

[detection on the other hand you probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m41s)
00:16:41

[just basically want to know whose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m44s)
00:16:44

[fraudulent right so you probably do just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m47s)
00:16:47

[care about the predictive model but then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m50s)
00:16:50

[you do have to think carefully about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m51s)
00:16:51

[data availability here so it's like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m53s)
00:16:53

[that we need to know who is fraudulent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m55s)
00:16:55

[at the point that we're about to deliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h16m58s)
00:16:58

[them a product right so it's no point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m00s)
00:17:00

[like looking at data that's available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m03s)
00:17:03

[like a month later for instance so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[you've kind of got this this key issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m07s)
00:17:07

[of thinking about you know the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m10s)
00:17:10

[operational constraints that you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m11s)
00:17:11

[working under you know lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m13s)
00:17:13

[interesting applications in human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m18s)
00:17:18

[resources but like employee churn it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m20s)
00:17:20

[another kind of churn model we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m23s)
00:17:23

[finding out that Jeremy Howard sick of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m25s)
00:17:25

[lecturing he's going to leave tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m28s)
00:17:28

[what are you going to do about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m30s)
00:17:30

[well knowing that wouldn't actually be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m31s)
00:17:31

[helpful it'd be too late right you would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m33s)
00:17:33

[actually want a model that said what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m36s)
00:17:36

[kinds of people you know are leaving USF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m38s)
00:17:38

[and it turns out that like Oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m41s)
00:17:41

[everybody that goes to the downstairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m43s)
00:17:43

[cafe leaves USF you know I guess their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m45s)
00:17:45

[food is awful or you know whatever right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m47s)
00:17:47

[or everybody that we're paying less than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m50s)
00:17:50

[half a million dollars a year is leaving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m53s)
00:17:53

[USF you know because they can't afford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m54s)
00:17:54

[basic housing in San Francisco so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h17m56s)
00:17:56

[you could use your employee churn model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m00s)
00:18:00

[not so much to say like which employees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m03s)
00:18:03

[hate us but why do employees leave right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m05s)
00:18:05

[and so again it's really the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m11s)
00:18:11

[interpretation there that that matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m14s)
00:18:14

[now lead prioritization is a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m19s)
00:18:19

[interesting one right like this is one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m22s)
00:18:22

[where a lot of companies yes Dana can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m24s)
00:18:24

[you pass that over there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m27s)
00:18:27

[you know so I was just wondering select](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m30s)
00:18:30

[the Shawn thing or you suggest it so one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m33s)
00:18:33

[being is like being an employee like a 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m35s)
00:18:35

[million a year or something but then it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m37s)
00:18:37

[sounds like there are two predictors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m40s)
00:18:40

[that you need to predict put I mean one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m41s)
00:18:41

[each Shawn and one you need to optimize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m43s)
00:18:43

[for it like you're profiting so how does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m45s)
00:18:45

[it work yeah exactly so this is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m47s)
00:18:47

[this like simulation model is all about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m49s)
00:18:49

[so it's a great question so like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m52s)
00:18:52

[kind of figure out this objective we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m55s)
00:18:55

[trying to maximize which is like company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m57s)
00:18:57

[profitability you can kind of create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h18m59s)
00:18:59

[like a pretty simple like Excel model or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m02s)
00:19:02

[something that says like here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m04s)
00:19:04

[revenues and here's the costs and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m05s)
00:19:05

[cost is equal to them you know number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m07s)
00:19:07

[people we employ multiplied by their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m09s)
00:19:09

[salaries blah blah blah blah blah right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m11s)
00:19:11

[and so inside that kind of Excel model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m13s)
00:19:13

[there are certain cells there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m17s)
00:19:17

[certain inputs where you're like oh that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m19s)
00:19:19

[thing's kind of stochastic you know or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m20s)
00:19:20

[that thing is kind of uncertain but we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m23s)
00:19:23

[could predict it with a model and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m26s)
00:19:26

[that's kind of what I what I do then is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m28s)
00:19:28

[I then say okay we need a predictive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m30s)
00:19:30

[model for how likely somebody is to stay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m31s)
00:19:31

[if we change their salary how much how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m35s)
00:19:35

[likely they are to leave you know with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m38s)
00:19:38

[the current salary how likely they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m41s)
00:19:41

[to leave next year if they if I increase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m45s)
00:19:45

[their salary now why blah so you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m47s)
00:19:47

[have ruled a bunch of these models and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m50s)
00:19:50

[then you can bind them together with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m52s)
00:19:52

[simple business logic and then you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m54s)
00:19:54

[optimize that you can then say okay if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h19m57s)
00:19:57

[you know pay Jeremy Howard half a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m01s)
00:20:01

[million dollars that's probably a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m03s)
00:20:03

[good idea you know and if I pay him less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m05s)
00:20:05

[than you know it's probably not or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m07s)
00:20:07

[whatever like you can figure out the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m09s)
00:20:09

[overall impact and so it's it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m11s)
00:20:11

[shocking to me how few people do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m15s)
00:20:15

[but most people in industry measure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m17s)
00:20:17

[their models using like a UC or our MSC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[or whatever which is never actually what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[yes can you pass it over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m32s)
00:20:32

[I wanted to stress the point that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m37s)
00:20:37

[made before um in my experience a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m40s)
00:20:40

[the problem was to define the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m42s)
00:20:42

[right so you you are in a company you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m46s)
00:20:46

[talking to somebody that doesn't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m48s)
00:20:48

[like this mentality that you have they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[don't know that you have to have x and y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m52s)
00:20:52

[and so on so you have to try to get that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m53s)
00:20:53

[out of them you know what exactly do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m56s)
00:20:56

[want and try to go through a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h20m58s)
00:20:58

[iterations of understanding what they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m00s)
00:21:00

[want and then you know the data you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m02s)
00:21:02

[what it is you know actually what you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[can measure which is often know what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m05s)
00:21:05

[they want so you have to kind of get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m07s)
00:21:07

[proxy for what they want and then so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m09s)
00:21:09

[lot of what you do is not that much of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m11s)
00:21:11

[like well some people do actually just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m13s)
00:21:13

[work on really good models for you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[but a lot of people also just work on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m18s)
00:21:18

[this kind of how do you put this I say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m20s)
00:21:20

[you know classification regression or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m23s)
00:21:23

[some other type of modeling that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m25s)
00:21:25

[actually kind of the most interesting I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m27s)
00:21:27

[think and also kind of what's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m30s)
00:21:30

[what you have to do well understand the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m32s)
00:21:32

[technical model building deeply but also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m38s)
00:21:38

[understand the kind of strategic context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m44s)
00:21:44

[deeply and so this is one way to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m47s)
00:21:47

[about it and as I say like you know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m50s)
00:21:50

[actually think you know there aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m53s)
00:21:53

[many articles I wrote in 2012 I'm still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m57s)
00:21:57

[recommending but this one I think is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h21m59s)
00:21:59

[still equally valid today so yeah so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m01s)
00:22:01

[like another great example is lead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m07s)
00:22:07

[prioritization right so like a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m09s)
00:22:09

[companies like every one of these boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m11s)
00:22:11

[I'm showing you can generally find a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[company or many companies whose sole job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m16s)
00:22:16

[in life is to build models of that thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m20s)
00:22:20

[right so there are lots of companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m23s)
00:22:23

[that sell laid prioritization systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m24s)
00:22:24

[but again like the question is how would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m29s)
00:22:29

[we use that information right so if it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m33s)
00:22:33

[like oh our best lead is Jeremy you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m36s)
00:22:36

[he's a highest probability of buying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m39s)
00:22:39

[does that mean I should send a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m43s)
00:22:43

[salesperson out to Jeremy or I shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m45s)
00:22:45

[like if he's highly probable to buy why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m47s)
00:22:47

[I waste my time with him you know so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m50s)
00:22:50

[like again it's like he really wants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m54s)
00:22:54

[some kind of simulation that says like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m55s)
00:22:55

[what's the chain the likely change in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h22m58s)
00:22:58

[Jeremy's behavior if I send my best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m00s)
00:23:00

[salesperson your net out to go and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m04s)
00:23:04

[encourage him to sign okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m07s)
00:23:07

[yeah I think this this is like there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m13s)
00:23:13

[many many opportunities for data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m15s)
00:23:15

[scientists in the world today to move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m17s)
00:23:17

[beyond predictive modeling to actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m20s)
00:23:20

[bringing it all together you know and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m22s)
00:23:22

[with the kind of stuff that Dena was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m25s)
00:23:25

[talking about in the question so as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m27s)
00:23:27

[as these horizontal applications that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m32s)
00:23:32

[basically apply to like every company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m34s)
00:23:34

[there's a whole bunch of applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m36s)
00:23:36

[that are specific to like every part of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m38s)
00:23:38

[the world right so if for those of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m40s)
00:23:40

[that end up in health care some of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m42s)
00:23:42

[will become experts in one or more of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m44s)
00:23:44

[these areas like readmission risk okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m47s)
00:23:47

[so what's the probability that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m53s)
00:23:53

[patient is going to come back to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m54s)
00:23:54

[hospital and readmission is depending on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h23m57s)
00:23:57

[the details of the jurisdiction and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m00s)
00:24:00

[forth it can be a disaster for hospitals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m05s)
00:24:05

[when somebody is readmitted right so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m07s)
00:24:07

[you find out that this patient has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m10s)
00:24:10

[high probability of readmission what do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m13s)
00:24:13

[you do about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m16s)
00:24:16

[well again the predictive model is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m17s)
00:24:17

[helpful of itself right it rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m19s)
00:24:19

[suggests like we just shouldn't send](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m21s)
00:24:21

[them home yet because they're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m23s)
00:24:23

[come back but wouldn't it be nice if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m25s)
00:24:25

[had the tree interpreter and it said to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m27s)
00:24:27

[us the reason that they're at high risk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[is because we don't have a recent EKG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m32s)
00:24:32

[for them and without a recent EKG we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m36s)
00:24:36

[can't have a high confidence about their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m40s)
00:24:40

[you know cardiac health in which case it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m42s)
00:24:42

[wouldn't be like well let's keep them in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m45s)
00:24:45

[the hospital for two weeks it'll be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m47s)
00:24:47

[let's give them an EKG okay so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m48s)
00:24:48

[this is interaction between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m52s)
00:24:52

[interpretation and predictive accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h24m54s)
00:24:54

[the predictive models are a really great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m03s)
00:25:03

[starting point but in order to actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m06s)
00:25:06

[like answer these questions we really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m08s)
00:25:08

[need to focus on the interpretability of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m10s)
00:25:10

[these models yeah I think so and and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m12s)
00:25:12

[more specifically I'm saying like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m15s)
00:25:15

[just learnt a whole raft of random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m17s)
00:25:17

[forest interpretation techniques and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[I kind of just to kind of try to justify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m23s)
00:25:23

[like well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m24s)
00:25:24

[why right and so the reason why is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m25s)
00:25:25

[because actually maybe I'd say most of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m31s)
00:25:31

[the time the interpretation is the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m34s)
00:25:34

[we care about and like you can create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m36s)
00:25:36

[chart you know or a table without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m41s)
00:25:41

[machine learning and indeed that's how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m45s)
00:25:45

[most of the world works right most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[managers like build all kinds of tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[and charts without any machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m52s)
00:25:52

[behind them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m54s)
00:25:54

[but they often make terrible decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m56s)
00:25:56

[because they don't know the future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h25m58s)
00:25:58

[importance of the objective they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m00s)
00:26:00

[interested in and so the table they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m02s)
00:26:02

[create is of things that actually are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m03s)
00:26:03

[the least important things anyway or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m05s)
00:26:05

[they just do a univariate chart rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m08s)
00:26:08

[than a partial dependence plot so they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m10s)
00:26:10

[don't actually realize that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m12s)
00:26:12

[relationship they thought they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m14s)
00:26:14

[looking at is drew entirely to something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[else right so you know I'm kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m17s)
00:26:17

[arguing for data scientists getting like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m22s)
00:26:22

[much more deeply involved in in strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m24s)
00:26:24

[and in trying to use machine learning to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m28s)
00:26:28

[really help you know help a business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m30s)
00:26:30

[with all of its objectives right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[there's like there companies like dun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m39s)
00:26:39

[hum B is a huge company that does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m41s)
00:26:41

[nothing but retail applications with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m43s)
00:26:43

[machine learning and so like I believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m46s)
00:26:46

[there's like a dun Humby product you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m48s)
00:26:48

[buy which will help you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m50s)
00:26:50

[which will help you figure out like if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m55s)
00:26:55

[put my new store in this location versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h26m57s)

[people are going to shop there or if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m02s)
00:27:02

[put like you know my diapers in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m04s)

[part of the shop versus that part of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m07s)

[shop how's that going to impact you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m09s)
00:27:09

[purchasing behavior or whatever right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m11s)
00:27:11

[it's I think it's also good to realize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m14s)
00:27:14

[that like the subset of machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[applications you tend to hear about you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m19s)
00:27:19

[know in in the tech press or whatever is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m22s)
00:27:22

[this massively biased tiny subset of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m27s)
00:27:27

[stuff which kind of Google and Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m30s)
00:27:30

[do where else the vast majority of stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m32s)
00:27:32

[that actually makes the world go around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m36s)
00:27:36

[is you know these kinds of applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m37s)
00:27:37

[that actually help people make things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m40s)
00:27:40

[buy things sell things build things so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m42s)
00:27:42

[forth so about create repetition the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m47s)
00:27:47

[we looked at the tree was we manually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m54s)
00:27:54

[check which feature could cause good was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h27m57s)
00:27:57

[more important for for particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m02s)
00:28:02

[observation but for businesses they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[would have a huge amount of data and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m06s)
00:28:06

[they they want this interpretation for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m09s)
00:28:09

[lot of observations so how do they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[automate it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[I don't think the automation is at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[difficult like you just you can run any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[of these algorithms like looping through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m21s)
00:28:21

[the rows or doing them in parallel it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[all this code oh I miss understand your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m26s)
00:28:26

[question is it like they set a threshold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[that if some feature is about like four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m32s)
00:28:32

[different different people will have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m36s)
00:28:36

[different behavior oh so so yeah okay I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m37s)
00:28:37

[guess it's good question that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m42s)
00:28:42

[important thing this is a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m44s)
00:28:44

[important issue actually is the vast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m45s)
00:28:45

[majority of machine learning models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m47s)
00:28:47

[don't automate anything they're designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m49s)
00:28:49

[to provide information to humans right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m52s)
00:28:52

[so for example if you're appointed sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h28m55s)
00:28:55

[customer service phone operator for an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m02s)
00:29:02

[insurance company and your customer asks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m04s)
00:29:04

[you why is my renewal $500 more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[expensive than last time then hopefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m11s)
00:29:11

[you know the insurance company has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m13s)
00:29:13

[provides in your terminal those little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m15s)
00:29:15

[screen that shows the result of the tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m17s)
00:29:17

[interpreter or whatever then chills so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m19s)
00:29:19

[that you can jump there and tell the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m21s)
00:29:21

[customer like okay well here's last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m23s)
00:29:23

[you're in this different zip code which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[you know is less has lower amounts of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[car theft and this year also you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m31s)
00:29:31

[actually changed your vehicle to more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m35s)
00:29:35

[expensive one or whatever right so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m36s)
00:29:36

[not so much about thresholds and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m40s)
00:29:40

[automation but about you know making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m43s)
00:29:43

[these model outputs available to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[decision-makers in an organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m49s)
00:29:49

[whether they be at the top strategic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m50s)
00:29:50

[level of like you know are we going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m53s)
00:29:53

[shut down this whole product or not all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m55s)
00:29:55

[the way to the operational level look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h29m58s)
00:29:58

[like it that that individual discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m00s)
00:30:00

[with a customer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m02s)
00:30:02

[so like another example is like aircraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m06s)
00:30:06

[scheduling and gate management like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[there's lots of companies that do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m12s)
00:30:12

[right and basically what happens is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[the the people you know there are there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[are people in at an airport whose job it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m19s)
00:30:19

[is to basically tell each aircraft what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m25s)
00:30:25

[gate to go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m28s)
00:30:28

[to figure out when to close the doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m30s)
00:30:30

[stuff like that and so the idea is you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m32s)
00:30:32

[know you're giving them software which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m34s)
00:30:34

[has the information they need to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m37s)
00:30:37

[good decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m38s)
00:30:38

[so the machine learning models end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m39s)
00:30:39

[embedded in that software to kind of say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[like okay that plane that's currently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

[coming in from Miami there's a 48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m46s)
00:30:46

[percent chance that it's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m49s)
00:30:49

[over five minutes late and if it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m51s)
00:30:51

[then this is going to be the knock-on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m53s)
00:30:53

[impact through the rest of the terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m55s)
00:30:55

[for instance okay well that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h30m57s)
00:30:57

[how these things turned a bit together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m00s)
00:31:00

[so there's so many of these right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m02s)
00:31:02

[there's lots and lots and so it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m05s)
00:31:05

[like I don't expect you to like remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m07s)
00:31:07

[all these applications but what I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m10s)
00:31:10

[want you to do is to like spend some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m11s)
00:31:11

[time like thinking about them like sit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m13s)
00:31:13

[down with one of your friends and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m16s)
00:31:16

[talk about a few examples of like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m17s)
00:31:17

[how would we go about like doing failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m21s)
00:31:21

[analysis and manufacturing like you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m25s)
00:31:25

[who-who would be doing that why would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m28s)
00:31:28

[they doing it what kind of models might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m29s)
00:31:29

[they use what kind of data might they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m31s)
00:31:31

[use like start to like practice this and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m33s)
00:31:33

[get a sense so because then this you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m36s)
00:31:36

[like interviewing and then when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m38s)
00:31:38

[at the workplace and you you know you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m40s)
00:31:40

[talking to managers you wouldn't be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m42s)
00:31:42

[straightaway able to kind of recognize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m46s)
00:31:46

[that the person you're talking to what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m48s)
00:31:48

[do they try to achieve what are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m50s)
00:31:50

[levers that they have to pull right what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m52s)
00:31:52

[if the data they have available to pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m54s)
00:31:54

[those levers to achieve that thing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m56s)
00:31:56

[therefore how could we build models to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h31m58s)
00:31:58

[help them do that and what kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m00s)
00:32:00

[predictions would they have to be making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m02s)
00:32:02

[right and so then you can have this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m04s)
00:32:04

[really thoughtful empathetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m06s)
00:32:06

[conversation with those people and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m08s)
00:32:08

[same like hey you know in order to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m10s)
00:32:10

[reduce the number of customers that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m13s)
00:32:13

[leaving you know I guess you're trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m16s)
00:32:16

[to figure out like you know who should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m17s)
00:32:17

[you be providing better pricing to or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m19s)
00:32:19

[whatever and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m21s)
00:32:21

[so what I'm noticing like from your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[beautiful little chart above is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[like a lot of this to me at least still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m35s)
00:32:35

[seems like the primary purpose is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m37s)
00:32:37

[at the at least base level like is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m40s)
00:32:40

[predictive power and so I guess my thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m43s)
00:32:43

[is is like for explanatory problems like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m46s)
00:32:46

[a lot of the ones that are people are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m49s)
00:32:49

[faced with like in social sciences is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m51s)
00:32:51

[that something machine learning can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m52s)
00:32:52

[used for or is used for or is that not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m54s)
00:32:54

[really the realm that it yeah it's um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m56s)
00:32:56

[that's a great question and I've had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h32m59s)
00:32:59

[lot of conversations about this with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m03s)
00:33:03

[people in social sciences and currently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m05s)
00:33:05

[machine learning is not well applied in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m07s)
00:33:07

[like economics or psychology or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m11s)
00:33:11

[on the whole but I'm Jun convinced it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[can be for the exact reasons we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m17s)
00:33:17

[talking about so if you're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m19s)
00:33:19

[figure out like you're going try to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m20s)
00:33:20

[some kind of behavioral economics and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m22s)
00:33:22

[you're trying to understand like why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m24s)
00:33:24

[some people behave differently to other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m25s)
00:33:25

[people you know a random forest with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m27s)
00:33:27

[feature importance what would be a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m30s)
00:33:30

[way to start or like more interestingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m32s)
00:33:32

[if you're trying to do some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m35s)
00:33:35

[sociology experiment or analysis based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m38s)
00:33:38

[on a large social network data set where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m41s)
00:33:41

[you have an observational study you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m44s)
00:33:44

[really want to try and pull out all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m46s)
00:33:46

[the sources of kind of exogenous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m47s)
00:33:47

[variables you know all the stuff that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m51s)
00:33:51

[going on outside and so if you use a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m53s)
00:33:53

[partial dependence plot with a random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m56s)
00:33:56

[forest that happens automatically so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h33m58s)
00:33:58

[actually gave a talk at MIT a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m00s)
00:34:00

[years ago for the first conference on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m05s)
00:34:05

[digital experimentation which was really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m08s)
00:34:08

[talking about like how do we experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m10s)
00:34:10

[in you know things like social networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[in kind of these digital environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m14s)
00:34:14

[and yeah economists economists all do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m17s)
00:34:17

[things with like you know classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m24s)
00:34:24

[statistical tests but um the group of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m26s)
00:34:26

[yeah yeah um so but anyway in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m31s)
00:34:31

[the The Economist's I talked to were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m36s)
00:34:36

[absolutely fascinated by this and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m39s)
00:34:39

[actually asked me to give a a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m41s)
00:34:41

[introduction to machine learning session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m43s)
00:34:43

[at MIT to these various faculty and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m46s)
00:34:46

[graduate folks in the Economics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m50s)
00:34:50

[Department and so and some of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m52s)
00:34:52

[folks have gone on to be you know write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m54s)
00:34:54

[some pretty famous books and stuff and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m57s)
00:34:57

[so hopefully it's been useful so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h34m58s)
00:34:58

[it's definitely early days but it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m00s)
00:35:00

[it's it's a big big opportunity but as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m02s)
00:35:02

[unit says it's you know there's plenty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m05s)
00:35:05

[of skepticism still out there huh well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m08s)
00:35:08

[the skepticism comes from unfamiliarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m18s)
00:35:18

[basically with like this totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m24s)
00:35:24

[different approach so like if you've if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m28s)
00:35:28

[you spent 20 years studying econometrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m29s)
00:35:29

[and somebody comes along and says you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m33s)
00:35:33

[know here's a totally different approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m36s)
00:35:36

[to all the econometrics all these stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m38s)
00:35:38

[that econometricians do you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m41s)
00:35:41

[naturally your first reaction will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[like prove it you know so let's do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m45s)
00:35:45

[enough but I think it's you know over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m49s)
00:35:49

[time the next generation of people who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m55s)
00:35:55

[are growing up with machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m58s)
00:35:58

[some of them will move into the social](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[sciences they'll make huge impacts that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m01s)
00:36:01

[nobody's ever managed to make before and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m04s)
00:36:04

[people will start going wow you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m06s)
00:36:06

[just like happened in computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m08s)
00:36:08

[right when you know computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m09s)
00:36:09

[spent a long time of people saying like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m12s)
00:36:12

[hey maybe you should use deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m14s)
00:36:14

[for computer vision and everybody in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m16s)
00:36:16

[computer vision is like proven you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m18s)
00:36:18

[we have decades of work on amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m20s)
00:36:20

[feature detectors for computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m25s)
00:36:25

[and then finally in 2012 you know Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m26s)
00:36:26

[and cadets key came along and said okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m30s)
00:36:30

[and models like twice as good as yours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m32s)
00:36:32

[and you know we've only just started on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m35s)
00:36:35

[this and everybody was like okay that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m39s)
00:36:39

[pretty convincing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m42s)
00:36:42

[nowadays every computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m44s)
00:36:44

[researcher basically uses the big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m46s)
00:36:46

[wedding so I think that time will come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m47s)
00:36:47

[in there in this area too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m50s)
00:36:50

[okay I think what we might do then is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m55s)
00:36:55

[take a break and we're going to come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h36m58s)
00:36:58

[back and talk about these random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m01s)
00:37:01

[interpretation techniques and do a do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m04s)
00:37:04

[bit of a review so let's come back at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m07s)
00:37:07

[two o'clock so let's have a go at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m11s)
00:37:11

[talking about these different random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m20s)
00:37:20

[forest interpretation methods having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m23s)
00:37:23

[talked about like why they're important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m24s)
00:37:24

[so let's now remind ourselves like what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[they are so I gotta let you folks have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m28s)
00:37:28

[go so let's let's start with confidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m32s)
00:37:32

[based on tree variance so can one of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m38s)
00:37:38

[tell me one or more of the following](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m41s)
00:37:41

[things about confidence based on tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m44s)
00:37:44

[variance to do what does it tell us why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m46s)
00:37:46

[would we be interested in that and how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m50s)
00:37:50

[is it calculated this is going back a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[ways first when we looked at even if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h37m57s)
00:37:57

[you're not sure you only know a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m01s)
00:38:01

[piece of it give us your piece and we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m03s)
00:38:03

[build on it together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m05s)
00:38:05

[I think I got a piece of it it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m09s)
00:38:09

[getting the variance of our predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m13s)
00:38:13

[from random forests that's true that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m16s)
00:38:16

[the how can you be more specific what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[it the variance of I think it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m22s)
00:38:22

[remembering correctly I think it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[the overall prediction the variance of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m28s)
00:38:28

[the predictions of the trees yes so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m31s)
00:38:31

[normally the prediction is just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m34s)
00:38:34

[average this is the variance of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m35s)
00:38:35

[trees and so it kind of just gives you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m38s)
00:38:38

[an idea of how much your prediction is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m39s)
00:38:39

[going to vary so if maybe even want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m42s)
00:38:42

[minimize variance maybe that's your goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m44s)
00:38:44

[for whatever reason that could be that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m46s)
00:38:46

[not so much the reason so I like your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m48s)
00:38:48

[calculation description let's see if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m50s)
00:38:50

[somebody else can tell us how you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m52s)
00:38:52

[use that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h38m54s)
00:38:54

[it's okay if you're not sure now have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m00s)
00:39:00

[start so I remember that we talked about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m03s)
00:39:03

[the independence of the trees and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m12s)
00:39:12

[maybe something about if the branch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m16s)
00:39:16

[the trees is higher or lower than no not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m20s)
00:39:20

[so much that um that's that's that's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m25s)
00:39:25

[interesting question but it's it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m28s)
00:39:28

[what we're going to see here I'm gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m30s)
00:39:30

[pass it back behind you so to remind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m33s)
00:39:33

[just to fill in a detail here what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m35s)
00:39:35

[generally do here is we take us just one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m37s)
00:39:37

[row like one observation often and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m40s)
00:39:40

[find out how confident we are about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m44s)
00:39:44

[like how much variance there are in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m47s)
00:39:47

[trees for that or we can do it as we did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m49s)
00:39:49

[here for different groups for each row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m51s)
00:39:51

[we calculate the standard deviation that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h39m57s)
00:39:57

[we get from the random forest model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m01s)
00:40:01

[then maybe group according to different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m03s)
00:40:03

[variables or predictors and see for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m07s)
00:40:07

[which particular predictor the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m10s)
00:40:10

[deviation is high then go deep donnas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m12s)
00:40:12

[why it is happening maybe it is because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m15s)
00:40:15

[a particular category of that variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m17s)
00:40:17

[has very less number of observation yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m20s)
00:40:20

[that's great so that that would be one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m23s)
00:40:23

[approach is kind of what we've done here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m25s)
00:40:25

[is to say like is there any groups that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m26s)
00:40:26

[have that where we're very unconfident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[something that I think is even more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[important would be when you're using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[this like operationally right let's say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m39s)
00:40:39

[you're doing a credit decisioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m42s)
00:40:42

[algorithm so we're trying to say like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m45s)
00:40:45

[okay is jeremy a good risk or a bad risk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m47s)
00:40:47

[should we loan him a million dollars and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m50s)
00:40:50

[the random forest says I think he's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m53s)
00:40:53

[good risk but I'm not at all confident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h40m58s)
00:40:58

[in which case we might say okay maybe I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m02s)
00:41:02

[shouldn't give him a million dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m04s)
00:41:04

[where else if we if if the Rena first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m05s)
00:41:05

[said I think he's a good risk I am very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m07s)
00:41:07

[sure of that then we're much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m10s)
00:41:10

[comfortable giving him a million dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m13s)
00:41:13

[right and I'm a very good risk so feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m15s)
00:41:15

[free to give me a million dollars right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m18s)
00:41:18

[I checked the random forest before a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m21s)
00:41:21

[different notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m23s)
00:41:23

[not in the repo so like this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m25s)
00:41:25

[it's quite hard for me to give you folks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m30s)
00:41:30

[direct experience with this kind of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m34s)
00:41:34

[single observation interpretation stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m38s)
00:41:38

[because it's really like the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m42s)
00:41:42

[stuff that that you actually need to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[putting out to the front line do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m47s)
00:41:47

[know what I mean like it's not something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m48s)
00:41:48

[which you can really use so much in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m50s)
00:41:50

[kind of casual context but it's more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[like okay if you're actually putting out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m54s)
00:41:54

[some algorithm which is making like big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h41m58s)
00:41:58

[decisions that could cost a lot of money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m01s)
00:42:01

[you probably don't so much care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m03s)
00:42:03

[the average prediction of the random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m06s)
00:42:06

[forest but maybe you actually care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m09s)
00:42:09

[like the average minus a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m11s)
00:42:11

[standard deviations you know like what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m14s)
00:42:14

[the kind of worst-case prediction and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[magic I mentioned it's like maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m22s)
00:42:22

[there's a whole group that we're kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m25s)
00:42:25

[unconfident about so yeah so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[confidence based on tree variance all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[right who wants to have a go with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[answering feature importance what is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m38s)
00:42:38

[why is it interesting how do we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m40s)
00:42:40

[calculate it or any subset thereof you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m42s)
00:42:42

[know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m44s)
00:42:44

[I think it's like that's basically to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m48s)
00:42:48

[find out which which of those which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m51s)
00:42:51

[features are important for your model so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m53s)
00:42:53

[you take each feature and you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m55s)
00:42:55

[randomly sample all the values in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h42m58s)
00:42:58

[feature and you see how the predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m00s)
00:43:00

[are if it's very different it means that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m03s)
00:43:03

[that feature was actually important as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m05s)
00:43:05

[if it's fine to take any random values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m07s)
00:43:07

[for that feature it means that maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m09s)
00:43:09

[probably it's not very okay that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[terrific there's this that was all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m13s)
00:43:13

[exactly right there was some details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m18s)
00:43:18

[that maybe were skimmed over a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m20s)
00:43:20

[bit I wonder if anybody else wants to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[jump into like a more detailed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[description of how it's calculated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m27s)
00:43:27

[because I know this morning some people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m28s)
00:43:28

[were not quite short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m30s)
00:43:30

[is there anybody who's like not quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m33s)
00:43:33

[sure maybe he wants to like have a go or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m34s)
00:43:34

[yeah well it was put it next to there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m36s)
00:43:36

[let's see how exactly do we calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m38s)
00:43:38

[feature importance for a particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m41s)
00:43:41

[feature check the validation school if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m43s)
00:43:43

[it gets pretty bad for after opening one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m54s)
00:43:54

[of the columns that means that column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m57s)
00:43:57

[was important so and as higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h43m59s)
00:43:59

[importance I'm not exactly sure how we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m02s)
00:44:02

[quantify the feature importance okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m07s)
00:44:07

[Dana do you know how we quantify the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[feature importance that was a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[description or score or some sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m15s)
00:44:15

[exactly yeah so let's say we've got our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m21s)
00:44:21

[dependent variable which is price right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m24s)
00:44:24

[and there's a bunch of independent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m26s)
00:44:26

[variables including year made right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m27s)
00:44:27

[so we basically we use the whole lot to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m30s)
00:44:30

[build a random forest right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m34s)
00:44:34

[that gives us our predictions right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m38s)
00:44:38

[so then we can let's call this Y right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m44s)
00:44:44

[and so then we can compare that to get I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m46s)
00:44:46

[don't know whatever R squared R MSC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m50s)
00:44:50

[whatever you're interested in right from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m52s)
00:44:52

[the model now the key thing here is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m54s)
00:44:54

[don't want to have to retrain my whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h44m58s)
00:44:58

[random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m00s)
00:45:00

[that's kind of slow and boring right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m01s)
00:45:01

[using the existing random forests how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m03s)
00:45:03

[can I figure out how important year made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m06s)
00:45:06

[was right and so the suggestion was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m09s)
00:45:09

[let's randomly shuffle the whole column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m12s)
00:45:12

[right so now that column is totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m14s)
00:45:14

[useless it's got the same mean same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m17s)
00:45:17

[distribution everything about it is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m19s)
00:45:19

[same but there's no connection at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m21s)
00:45:21

[between particular people actual year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m23s)
00:45:23

[made and what's now in that column I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m26s)
00:45:26

[randomly shuffled it okay and so now I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m28s)
00:45:28

[put that new version through with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m30s)
00:45:30

[same random forest so there's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m38s)
00:45:38

[retraining done okay to get some new y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m40s)
00:45:40

[hat I call it Y hat way M right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m45s)
00:45:45

[I can compare that to my actuals to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m49s)
00:45:49

[like an RSC ym right and so now I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m52s)
00:45:52

[start to create a little table so now I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h45m58s)
00:45:58

[can create a little table where I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m04s)
00:46:04

[basically got like the original here our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m06s)
00:46:06

[MSC and then I've got with year made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m09s)
00:46:09

[scrambled so this one had an ARMA see of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m13s)
00:46:13

[like three this one had an ARMA see of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m16s)
00:46:16

[like two enclosure scrambling that had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m19s)
00:46:19

[our MSC of like 2.5 right and so then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m25s)
00:46:25

[just take these differences so I'd say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m28s)
00:46:28

[year made the importance is one 3-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[enclosure is 0.53 minus 2 and 1/2 and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m34s)
00:46:34

[forth right so how much worse did my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m39s)
00:46:39

[model get after I shuffled that variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m42s)
00:46:42

[anybody have any questions about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m46s)
00:46:46

[can you pass that to Danielle please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[um I assume you just chose those numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m52s)
00:46:52

[randomly but I question I guess is does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h46m56s)
00:46:56

[it stop do all them be ready I'm not a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m00s)
00:47:00

[perfect model to start out with like are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m02s)
00:47:02

[they welded all the important says seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m04s)
00:47:04

[to one or is that not no they're just I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m07s)
00:47:07

[don't honestly I've never actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m09s)
00:47:09

[looked at what the units are so I'm not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m11s)
00:47:11

[I'm actually not quite sure sorry we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m13s)
00:47:13

[check it out during the week if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m16s)
00:47:16

[somebody's interested how the Vulcans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m17s)
00:47:17

[have a look at the this SK learn code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m19s)
00:47:19

[and see exactly what those units of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[measure are cuz I've never bothered to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m25s)
00:47:25

[check although I don't check like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m27s)
00:47:27

[units of measure specifically what I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m30s)
00:47:30

[check is the relative importance and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m31s)
00:47:31

[like here's an example so rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m36s)
00:47:36

[just saying like what are the top ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m38s)
00:47:38

[yesterday one of the practicum students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m39s)
00:47:39

[asked me about a feature importance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m45s)
00:47:45

[where they said like oh I think these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m48s)
00:47:48

[three are important and I pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m49s)
00:47:49

[that the top one was a thousand times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m51s)
00:47:51

[more important than the second one right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m54s)
00:47:54

[so like look at the relative numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m56s)
00:47:56

[here and so in that case it's like no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h47m59s)
00:47:59

[don't look at the top three look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m01s)
00:48:01

[one that's a thousand times more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m03s)
00:48:03

[important and ignore all the rest and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m04s)
00:48:04

[this is where sometimes the kind of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m07s)
00:48:07

[natural tendency to want to be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m09s)
00:48:09

[precise and careful you need to override](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m12s)
00:48:12

[that and be very practical it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m14s)
00:48:14

[okay this thing's a thousand times more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m16s)
00:48:16

[important don't spend any time on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m17s)
00:48:17

[anything else right so then you can go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m19s)
00:48:19

[and talk to the manager of your project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m22s)
00:48:22

[and say like okay this thing's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m23s)
00:48:23

[thousand times more important and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m25s)
00:48:25

[they might say oh that was a mistake it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m27s)
00:48:27

[shouldn't have been in there we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m31s)
00:48:31

[actually have that information at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m32s)
00:48:32

[decision time or you know but for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m33s)
00:48:33

[whatever reason we can't actually use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m37s)
00:48:37

[that variable and so then you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m39s)
00:48:39

[remove it and and have a look or they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m40s)
00:48:40

[might say gosh I had no idea that like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m43s)
00:48:43

[that was more by far more important than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m45s)
00:48:45

[everything else put together so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m47s)
00:48:47

[forget this random virus thing and just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m49s)
00:48:49

[focus on like understanding how we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m53s)
00:48:53

[better collect that one variable and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m55s)
00:48:55

[better use that one variable so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m57s)
00:48:57

[like something which comes up quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h48m59s)
00:48:59

[lot and actually another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m03s)
00:49:03

[place that came up just yesterday again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m04s)
00:49:04

[another practicum student asked me hey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m06s)
00:49:06

[I'm doing this medical diagnostics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m10s)
00:49:10

[project and my r-squared is 0.95 for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m13s)
00:49:13

[disease which I was told is very hard to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m19s)
00:49:19

[diagnose you know is this random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m21s)
00:49:21

[forrester genius or is something going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m23s)
00:49:23

[wrong and I said like remember the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m25s)
00:49:25

[second thing you do after you build a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m28s)
00:49:28

[random forest is to do feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m30s)
00:49:30

[importance so do feature importance and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m31s)
00:49:31

[what you'll probably find is that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m34s)
00:49:34

[top column is something that shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m37s)
00:49:37

[be there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m39s)
00:49:39

[and so that's what happened he came back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m39s)
00:49:39

[to me half an hour later he said yeah I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m41s)
00:49:41

[did the feature importance you were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m43s)
00:49:43

[right the top column was basically a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m44s)
00:49:44

[something that was another encoding of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m47s)
00:49:47

[the dependent variable I've removed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m50s)
00:49:50

[and now my a squared is negative 0.1 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m52s)
00:49:52

[that's an improvement okay the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h49m56s)
00:49:56

[thing I like to look at is this chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m04s)
00:50:04

[right is to basically say like you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m06s)
00:50:06

[where the kind of things flatten off in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m08s)
00:50:08

[terms of like which ones should I be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m11s)
00:50:11

[really focusing on so that's the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m12s)
00:50:12

[important one right and so when I did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m16s)
00:50:16

[credit scoring in telecommunications I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m18s)
00:50:18

[found there were nine variables that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m20s)
00:50:20

[basically predicted very accurately who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[was it going to end up paying for their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m25s)
00:50:25

[phone and who wasn't and like apart from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m26s)
00:50:26

[ending up with a model that saved them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[three billion dollars a year in in fraud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[and credit costs it also let them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m35s)
00:50:35

[basically rejigger their their process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m36s)
00:50:36

[so they focused on collecting those nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m39s)
00:50:39

[variables much better all right who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m41s)
00:50:41

[wants to do partial dependence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[this is an interesting one very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[important but you know somebody's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m54s)
00:50:54

[of tricky to think about yeah please do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h50m57s)
00:50:57

[not always necessarily like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m04s)
00:51:04

[relationship between the strictly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[dependent variable in this independent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m11s)
00:51:11

[variable that necessarily like is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m12s)
00:51:12

[showing importance but rather than an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m14s)
00:51:14

[interaction between two variables that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m17s)
00:51:17

[are working together right yeah oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[that's weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m23s)
00:51:23

[yeah and so for this example what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m27s)
00:51:27

[found was that it's not necessarily your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m31s)
00:51:31

[maid or when the sale was elapsed but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m33s)
00:51:33

[it's actually the age of the model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m36s)
00:51:36

[so it's that is easier to just like to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m38s)
00:51:38

[tell a liked company well obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m40s)
00:51:40

[you're younger models are gonna sell for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m43s)
00:51:43

[more and it's less about when the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m45s)
00:51:45

[was made yeah so let's come back to how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m47s)
00:51:47

[we calculate this in a moment but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m51s)
00:51:51

[first thing to realize is that the vast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m53s)
00:51:53

[majority of the time you know post your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m55s)
00:51:55

[course here when somebody shows you a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h51m58s)
00:51:58

[chart it'll be like a univariate chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m00s)
00:52:00

[that'll just like grab the data from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m03s)
00:52:03

[database and they'll plot X against Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m04s)
00:52:04

[and then managers have a tendency to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m06s)
00:52:06

[want to like make a decision all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m09s)
00:52:09

[so be like oh there's this like drop off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m10s)
00:52:10

[here so we should like stop dealing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m12s)
00:52:12

[equipment made between 1990 and 1995 or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m15s)
00:52:15

[whatever right and this is like a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m19s)
00:52:19

[problem because like real world data has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m23s)
00:52:23

[lots of these interactions going on so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m25s)
00:52:25

[like you know maybe there was a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m29s)
00:52:29

[recession going on around the time that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m31s)
00:52:31

[those things are being sold or maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m34s)
00:52:34

[around that time people were buying more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m35s)
00:52:35

[of a different type of equipment or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m37s)
00:52:37

[whatever right so generally what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m39s)
00:52:39

[actually want to know is all other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m41s)
00:52:41

[things being equal what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m43s)
00:52:43

[relationship between ear made and sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m46s)
00:52:46

[price right because like if you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m49s)
00:52:49

[about the drivetrain approach idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m51s)
00:52:51

[like the levers you really want a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m54s)
00:52:54

[that says if I change this lever how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m56s)
00:52:56

[will it change my objective okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h52m59s)
00:52:59

[it's by pulling them apart using partial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m04s)
00:53:04

[dependence that you can say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m07s)
00:53:07

[actually this is the relationship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m09s)
00:53:09

[between year made and sale price all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[other things being equal right so how do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[we calculate that for the variable you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m17s)
00:53:17

[made for example you're gonna train you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[keep every other car variable constant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m26s)
00:53:26

[and then you're gonna pass every single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m28s)
00:53:28

[value of the year mate and then train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m30s)
00:53:30

[the model after that so for every model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m32s)
00:53:32

[you might have their light blue or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m34s)
00:53:34

[values of it and the median is gonna be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m38s)
00:53:38

[the yellow line okay so let's try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m40s)
00:53:40

[draw that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m46s)
00:53:46

[so bye leave everything else constant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m48s)
00:53:48

[what she means is leave them at whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m52s)
00:53:52

[they are in the data set so just like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m54s)
00:53:54

[when we did feature importance right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m57s)
00:53:57

[we're going to leave the rest of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h53m59s)
00:53:59

[data set as it is and we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m00s)
00:54:00

[partial dependence plot for year made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m02s)
00:54:02

[all right so we've got all of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m05s)
00:54:05

[other rows of data that we'll just leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m06s)
00:54:06

[as they are and so instead of randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m09s)
00:54:09

[shuffling em8 instead what we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m13s)
00:54:13

[to do is replace every single value with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m17s)
00:54:17

[exactly the same thing 1960 okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m20s)
00:54:20

[just like before we now pass that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m28s)
00:54:28

[through our existing random forests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m31s)
00:54:31

[which we have not retrained or changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m33s)
00:54:33

[in any way to get back out a set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m35s)
00:54:35

[predictions why 1960 okay and so then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m38s)
00:54:38

[can plot that on a chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m45s)
00:54:45

[yeah I'd against partial dependence 1960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m47s)
00:54:47

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m53s)
00:54:53

[okay now we can do it for 1960 one two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m56s)
00:54:56

[three four five and so forth right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h54m59s)
00:54:59

[so we can do that for four on average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m03s)
00:55:03

[for all of them or we could do it just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m08s)
00:55:08

[for one of them right and so when we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m11s)
00:55:11

[it for just one of them and we change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m14s)
00:55:14

[its year may to pass that single thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m16s)
00:55:16

[through our model that gives us one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m19s)
00:55:19

[these blue lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m21s)
00:55:21

[that's a each one of these blue lines is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m22s)
00:55:22

[a single row as we change its year made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m25s)
00:55:25

[from 1960 up to 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m28s)
00:55:28

[and so then we can just take the median](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m32s)
00:55:32

[of all of those blue lines to say you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m35s)
00:55:35

[know on average what's the relationship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m38s)
00:55:38

[between year made and price all other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m41s)
00:55:41

[things being equal so why is it that why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m45s)
00:55:45

[is it that this works why is it that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m51s)
00:55:51

[this process tells us the relationship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m53s)
00:55:53

[between year made and price all other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m56s)
00:55:56

[things being equal well maybe it's good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h55m58s)
00:55:58

[to think about like a really simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m01s)
00:56:01

[approach a really simplified approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m02s)
00:56:02

[would say what's the average auction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m04s)
00:56:04

[you know what's the average sale date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m07s)
00:56:07

[what's the most common type of machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m10s)
00:56:10

[we sell which location do we mainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m13s)
00:56:13

[mostly sell things and like we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m16s)
00:56:16

[come up with a single row that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m17s)
00:56:17

[represents the the average option and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m19s)
00:56:19

[then we could say okay let's run that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m21s)
00:56:21

[row through the random forest but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m24s)
00:56:24

[replace its year made with 1960 and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m26s)
00:56:26

[do it again with 1961 and then do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m29s)
00:56:29

[again with 1962 and we could like plot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m31s)
00:56:31

[you know those on our little chart right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m33s)
00:56:33

[and that would give us a version of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m36s)
00:56:36

[relationship between year made and sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m43s)
00:56:43

[price all other things being equal right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m44s)
00:56:44

[but what if like tractors looked like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m48s)
00:56:48

[that and backhoe loaders looked like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h56m55s)
00:56:55

[that right then taking the average one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m01s)
00:57:01

[would hide the fact that there are these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m05s)
00:57:05

[totally different relationships right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m08s)
00:57:08

[instead we basically say okay our data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m11s)
00:57:11

[tells us what kinds of things we tend to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m14s)
00:57:14

[sell and who we tend to sell them - and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[when we tend to sell them so let's use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m19s)
00:57:19

[that right so then we actually find out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m21s)
00:57:21

[like for every blue line like here are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m24s)
00:57:24

[actual examples of these relationships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m27s)
00:57:27

[right and so then what we can do is as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m31s)
00:57:31

[well as flooding the median is we can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m34s)
00:57:34

[a cluster analysis to find out like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m36s)
00:57:36

[few different shapes right and so we may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m39s)
00:57:39

[find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m44s)
00:57:44

[in this case they all look like pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m46s)
00:57:46

[much the different versions of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m47s)
00:57:47

[thing with different slopes so my main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[takeaway from this would be that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m53s)
00:57:53

[relationship between sale price and year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h57m57s)
00:57:57

[is basically a straight line right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m00s)
00:58:00

[remember this was log of sale price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m03s)
00:58:03

[right so this is actually showing us an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m06s)
00:58:06

[exponential and so this is where I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m09s)
00:58:09

[then like bring in the domain expertise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m11s)
00:58:11

[which is like okay things depreciate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m14s)
00:58:14

[over time by a constant ratio so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m18s)
00:58:18

[therefore I would expect older stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m22s)
00:58:22

[year made to have this exponential shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m26s)
00:58:26

[so this is where like I said of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m30s)
00:58:30

[mentioned like the very start of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m32s)
00:58:32

[machine learning project I generally try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m34s)
00:58:34

[to avoid as using as much domain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m38s)
00:58:38

[expertise as I can and let the data do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m40s)
00:58:40

[the talking all right so like one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m42s)
00:58:42

[questions I got this morning was like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m44s)
00:58:44

[there's like a sale I'd be a model ID I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m47s)
00:58:47

[should throw those away right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m49s)
00:58:49

[they're just IDs no don't assume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m51s)
00:58:51

[anything about your data right leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m54s)
00:58:54

[them in and if they turn out to be super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m57s)
00:58:57

[important predictors you want to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h58m59s)
00:58:59

[out you know why is that okay but then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m01s)
00:59:01

[now I'm at the other end of my project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[right I've done my feature importance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m06s)
00:59:06

[I've pulled out the stuff which is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m08s)
00:59:08

[you know from that dendogram you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m10s)
00:59:10

[the kind of redundant features I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m13s)
00:59:13

[looking at the partial dependence and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m15s)
00:59:15

[now I'm thinking like okay is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m16s)
00:59:16

[shaped what I expected okay so even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[better before you plot this first of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m22s)
00:59:22

[think what shape would I expect this to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m25s)
00:59:25

[be because it's always easy to justify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[to yourself after the fact oh I knew it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m30s)
00:59:30

[would look like this right so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m31s)
00:59:31

[straight you expect and then is it that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m33s)
00:59:33

[shape so in this case I'd be like yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[this is this is what I would expect okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m36s)
00:59:36

[where else this is definitely not what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m40s)
00:59:40

[I'd expect so the partial dependence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m43s)
00:59:43

[plot has really pulled out the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m46s)
00:59:46

[underlying truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m48s)
00:59:48

[okay does anybody have any questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m50s)
00:59:50

[about like why we use partial dependence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m53s)
00:59:53

[or how we calculate it it's got the are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=00h59m57s)
00:59:57

[you better don't say you have a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m02s)
01:00:02

[thousand say twenty features everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m06s)
01:00:06

[are important are you gonna measure the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m11s)
01:00:11

[partial dependence for every single one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m14s)
01:00:14

[of them if there are twenty features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m16s)
01:00:16

[that are important then I will do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m24s)
01:00:24

[partial dependence for all of them we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[important means like it's a lever I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m28s)
01:00:28

[actually pull it's like the magnitude of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m32s)
01:00:32

[its size is like not much smaller than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m36s)
01:00:36

[the other nineteen like you know based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m39s)
01:00:39

[on all of these things it's like yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m41s)
01:00:41

[it's a feature I ought to care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m42s)
01:00:42

[then I will want to know how it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m44s)
01:00:44

[related it's pretty unusual to have that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m46s)
01:00:46

[many features that are important both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m50s)
01:00:50

[operationally and from a modeling point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m54s)
01:00:54

[of view in my experience so how do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h00m56s)
01:00:56

[define internationally so important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m01s)
01:01:01

[means it's it's a lever so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m05s)
01:01:05

[something I can change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m09s)
01:01:09

[and it's like you know kind of at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m12s)
01:01:12

[spiky end of this tail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m20s)
01:01:20

[or you know it maybe it's not a lever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m26s)
01:01:26

[directly like maybe it's like zip code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m29s)
01:01:29

[and I can't actually tell my customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m32s)
01:01:32

[where to live but I could like focus my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m35s)

[new marketing attention on a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m39s)
01:01:39

[zip code you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m41s)
01:01:41

[would it make sense to do pairwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m45s)
01:01:45

[shuffling for every combination of two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m46s)
01:01:46

[features and hold everything else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m50s)
01:01:50

[constant like in future importance to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m52s)
01:01:52

[see interactions and compare scores so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h01m54s)
01:01:54

[you wouldn't do that so much for partial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m00s)
01:02:00

[dependence I think your question is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m02s)
01:02:02

[really getting to the question of could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m05s)
01:02:05

[we do that for feature importance all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m09s)
01:02:09

[right so I think interaction feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m12s)
01:02:12

[importance is a very important and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m16s)
01:02:16

[interesting question but doing doing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m18s)
01:02:18

[by randomly shuffling every pair of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m22s)
01:02:22

[columns you know if you've got a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m24s)
01:02:24

[columns sounds computationally intensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m28s)
01:02:28

[possibly infeasible so what I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m31s)
01:02:31

[do is after we talk about tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m34s)
01:02:34

[interpreter I'll talk about interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m36s)
01:02:36

[but largely unexplored approach that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m39s)
01:02:39

[will probably work okay who wants to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m41s)
01:02:41

[tree interpreter all right over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m46s)
01:02:46

[Prince](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m49s)
01:02:49

[can you pass that over here to principal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m52s)
01:02:52

[I was thinking this to be more like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h02m54s)
01:02:54

[feature importance but teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m01s)
01:03:01

[importance is for complete random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m03s)
01:03:03

[model and this tree interpreter is for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m05s)
01:03:05

[feature importance for particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m07s)
01:03:07

[observation so if that let's say it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[about hospital readmission so if a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m13s)
01:03:13

[patient a one is it is going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m15s)
01:03:15

[readmitted to a hospital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m18s)
01:03:18

[which featured for that particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m19s)
01:03:19

[patient is going to impact and how can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m22s)
01:03:22

[we change that and it is calculated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m26s)
01:03:26

[starting from the prediction of mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m27s)
01:03:27

[then seeing how each feature is changing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m30s)
01:03:30

[the behavior of that particular patient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m34s)
01:03:34

[I'm smiling because that was one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m37s)
01:03:37

[best examples of technical communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m40s)
01:03:40

[I've heard in a long time so it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m43s)
01:03:43

[good to think about like what why was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[that effective right so what Prince did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[there was he used as specific an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m50s)
01:03:50

[as possible right so if humans are much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m54s)
01:03:54

[less good at understanding abstractions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m57s)
01:03:57

[right so if you kind of say oh it takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h03m59s)
01:03:59

[some kind of feature and then there's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m01s)
01:04:01

[observation in that feature river you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m04s)
01:04:04

[know where's like know it's it's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m06s)
01:04:06

[hospital readmission okay and so we take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m07s)
01:04:07

[a specific example the other thing he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m10s)
01:04:10

[did was very effective was to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m13s)
01:04:13

[take an analogy to something we already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m16s)
01:04:16

[understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m17s)
01:04:17

[so we already understand the idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m18s)
01:04:18

[feature importance across all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m20s)
01:04:20

[rows in a data set so now we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m24s)
01:04:24

[do it for a single row okay so like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m26s)
01:04:26

[know one of the things I was really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[hoping we would learn from from this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m32s)
01:04:32

[experience is how to become effective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m34s)
01:04:34

[technical communicators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m36s)
01:04:36

[so you know that was a really great role](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m37s)
01:04:37

[model from Prince of like using all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m40s)
01:04:40

[tricks we have at our disposal for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m43s)
01:04:43

[effective technical communication so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m46s)
01:04:46

[hopefully you found that useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m48s)
01:04:48

[explanation I don't have a hell of a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m49s)
01:04:49

[to add to that other than to show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m51s)
01:04:51

[you know what that looks like so with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m53s)
01:04:53

[the tree interpreter we peaked out a row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h04m57s)
01:04:57

[okay and so remember when we talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m01s)
01:05:01

[about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m05s)
01:05:05

[the confidence intervals at the very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m06s)
01:05:06

[start the confidence based on tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m09s)
01:05:09

[variance we mainly said like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m11s)
01:05:11

[probably mainly use that for a Rome so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m13s)
01:05:13

[this would also be for our crow so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m15s)
01:05:15

[like okay why is this patient likely to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m17s)
01:05:17

[be readmitted okay so here is all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m22s)
01:05:22

[information we have about that patient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m25s)
01:05:25

[or in this case this option now why is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m27s)
01:05:27

[this auction so expensive so then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[call tree interpreter dot predict and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m35s)
01:05:35

[get back the prediction of the price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m37s)
01:05:37

[right the bias which is the root of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m39s)
01:05:39

[tree so this is just the average price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m43s)
01:05:43

[for everybody so this is always going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m46s)
01:05:46

[be the same and then the contributions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m47s)
01:05:47

[which is how important is each of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m50s)
01:05:50

[each of these things right and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m56s)
01:05:56

[way we calculated that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h05m59s)
01:05:59

[so the way we calculated that was to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m08s)
01:06:08

[okay at the very start the average price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m10s)
01:06:10

[was ten right and then we split on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m14s)
01:06:14

[enclosure right and for those with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m18s)
01:06:18

[dissin closure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m22s)
01:06:22

[the average was nine point five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m24s)
01:06:24

[and then we split on year made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m28s)
01:06:28

[I don't know less than 1990 and for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m31s)
01:06:31

[those with that year made the average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[price was nine point seven right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m35s)
01:06:35

[then we split on the number of hours on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m40s)
01:06:40

[the meter and for you know with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m43s)
01:06:43

[branch we got nine point four all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m45s)
01:06:45

[and so we then have a particular option](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m50s)
01:06:50

[which we we pass it through the tree and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m54s)
01:06:54

[it just so happens that it takes this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h06m57s)
01:06:57

[path all right so one row can only have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m00s)
01:07:00

[one path through the tree right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m03s)
01:07:03

[we ended up at this point okay so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m07s)
01:07:07

[we can create a little table right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m14s)
01:07:14

[so as we go through we start at the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m17s)
01:07:17

[and we start with 10 right that's that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m19s)
01:07:19

[bias and we said enclosure resulted in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m22s)
01:07:22

[change from 10 to 9 and 1/2 minus 0.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m27s)
01:07:27

[yeah man changed it from nine point five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[to nine point seven so plus 0.2 right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m35s)
01:07:35

[and then meter changed it from nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m39s)
01:07:39

[point seven down to nine point four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m40s)
01:07:40

[which is minus 0.3 and then if we add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m45s)
01:07:45

[all that together can minus a half is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m51s)
01:07:51

[nine and a half plus 0.2 is nine point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m55s)
01:07:55

[seven minus point three is nine point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h07m58s)
01:07:58

[four low and behold that's that number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m00s)
01:08:00

[which takes us to our Excel spreadsheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m07s)
01:08:07

[where's Chris who did our waterfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m17s)
01:08:17

[there you are all right so last week we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m20s)
01:08:20

[had to use Excel for this because there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m25s)
01:08:25

[isn't a good Python library for doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m27s)
01:08:27

[waterfall charts and so we saw we got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m30s)
01:08:30

[our starting point this is the bias and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m32s)
01:08:32

[then we had each of our contributions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m34s)
01:08:34

[and we ended up with our total the road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m36s)
01:08:36

[is now a better place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m40s)
01:08:40

[because Chris has created a Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m41s)
01:08:41

[waterfall chart module for us and put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m43s)
01:08:43

[on pip so never again where we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m45s)

[use Excel for this and I wanted to point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m48s)

[out that like waterfall charts have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m51s)
01:08:51

[very important in business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m54s)
01:08:54

[communications at least as long as I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m55s)

[been in business so that's about 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h08m58s)

[years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m01s)
01:09:01

[Python is you know what couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m03s)
01:09:03

[decades old a little bit less yeah maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m06s)
01:09:06

[a couple of decades old but you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m08s)
01:09:08

[despite that no one in the Python world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m11s)

[ever got to the point where they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m14s)
01:09:14

[actually thought you know I'm gonna make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m16s)
01:09:16

[a waterfall chart so they didn't exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[until two days ago which is to say like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m21s)
01:09:21

[the world is full of staff which ought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m25s)

[build Chris how long did it take you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m32s)
01:09:32

[build the first Python waterfall chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m33s)
01:09:33

[well there was a you know a gist of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m38s)
01:09:38

[yeah yeah yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m40s)

[hefty TYIN amount but not unreasonable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m50s)

[and now forevermore people when they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m53s)
01:09:53

[want the place and waterfall chart will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m57s)
01:09:57

[end up at Chris's github repo and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h09m58s)
01:09:58

[hopefully find lots of other USF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m01s)

[improve Chris's plaything waterfall you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m10s)
01:10:10

[need to know how to do that right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m13s)
01:10:13

[you're going to need to submit a pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m15s)
01:10:15

[request life becomes very easy for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m17s)
01:10:17

[submitting pull requests if you use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m22s)
01:10:22

[something called hub so if you go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m23s)
01:10:23

[github slash hub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m25s)
01:10:25

[that will send you over here and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m29s)
01:10:29

[they suggest you do is that you alias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m33s)
01:10:33

[get to hub because it turns out that hub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m35s)
01:10:35

[actually is earth strict superset if get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m37s)
01:10:37

[but what it lets you do is you can go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m40s)
01:10:40

[get fork get push get pull request and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m45s)
01:10:45

[you've now sent Chris a pull request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m50s)
01:10:50

[now without hub this is actually a pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m53s)
01:10:53

[and requires like own to the website and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m55s)

[filling informants and stuff right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h10m58s)
01:10:58

[this gives you no reason not to do pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h11m00s)

[for most of the FASTA i dot structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h12m40s)

[thank you okay does anybody have any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h12m46s)

[questions about how to calculate any of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h12m53s)
01:12:53

[these random forest interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h12m58s)
01:12:58

[methods or why we might want to use any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h12m59s)
01:12:59

[of these random first interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m03s)
01:13:03

[methods towards the end of the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m04s)
01:13:04

[you're going to need to be able to build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m07s)
01:13:07

[all of these yourself from scratch over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m08s)
01:13:08

[there can you pass that test that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m15s)
01:13:15

[right just looking at the tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m19s)
01:13:19

[interpreter I noticed that some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m21s)
01:13:21

[the values are in a ends how I got I get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m24s)
01:13:24

[my you keep them in the tree but how can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m31s)
01:13:31

[an NA and have a future importance okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m33s)
01:13:33

[let me pass it back to you why not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m37s)
01:13:37

[so in other words how is ni n handled in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m41s)
01:13:41

[pandas and therefore in the tree such as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[some default value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m50s)
01:13:50

[everybody remember how pandas these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m53s)
01:13:53

[notices are all in categorical variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m56s)
01:13:56

[how does pandas handle an NA ends in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[categorical variables and how does fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m00s)
01:14:00

[AI deal with them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[can somebody pass it to the person who's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m03s)
01:14:03

[talking negative one through yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m06s)
01:14:06

[pandas sets into negative one category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m12s)
01:14:12

[code and do you have to remember what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m14s)
01:14:14

[then do doesn't matter really we add one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m16s)
01:14:16

[to all of the category codes so it ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m19s)
01:14:19

[up being zero so in other words we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m21s)
01:14:21

[a category with remember by the time it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m23s)
01:14:23

[hits the random forest is just a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m26s)
01:14:26

[and it's just it's just the number zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m27s)
01:14:27

[right and we map it back to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m29s)
01:14:29

[descriptions back here so the question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m32s)
01:14:32

[really is why shouldn't the random first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m34s)
01:14:34

[be able to split on zero it's just it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m37s)
01:14:37

[just another number so it could be na n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m41s)
01:14:41

[high medium or low zero one two three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m43s)
01:14:43

[four and so you know missing values are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m46s)
01:14:46

[one of these things that are generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m50s)
01:14:50

[taught really badly like often people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m52s)
01:14:52

[get taught like here are some ways to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m55s)
01:14:55

[remove columns with missing values or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m56s)
01:14:56

[remove rows with missing values or to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h14m58s)
01:14:58

[replace missing values that's like never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m00s)
01:15:00

[what we want because missingness is very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m05s)
01:15:05

[very very often interesting and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m08s)
01:15:08

[actually learnt that from our future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[importance that cupola system n a n is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m13s)
01:15:13

[like one of the most important features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m16s)
01:15:16

[and so for some reason well I could I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m19s)
01:15:19

[could guess right coupla system n am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m22s)
01:15:22

[presumably means this is a kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m25s)
01:15:25

[industrial equipment that doesn't have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m27s)
01:15:27

[coupler system now I don't know what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m29s)
01:15:29

[kind that is but apparently it's more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m31s)
01:15:31

[it's a more expensive kind that makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m34s)
01:15:34

[sense yeah ok ok so I did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m37s)

[research success where by far the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m46s)
01:15:46

[important predictors were whether or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m50s)
01:15:50

[some of the fields were a null and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m53s)
01:15:53

[turned out that this was data leakage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m56s)
01:15:56

[that these fields only got filled in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h15m59s)
01:15:59

[most of the time after a research grant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m01s)
01:16:01

[was accepted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m03s)
01:16:03

[right so you know it allowed me to win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m05s)
01:16:05

[that cowgirl competition but didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m07s)
01:16:07

[actually help the university very much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m10s)
01:16:10

[okay great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m12s)
01:16:12

[so let's talk about um extrapolation and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m16s)
01:16:16

[I am going to do something risky and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m22s)
01:16:22

[dangerous which is we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m26s)
01:16:26

[some live coding and the reason we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[going to do some live coding is I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m33s)
01:16:33

[to explore extrapolation together with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m37s)
01:16:37

[you and I kind of also want to get kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m38s)
01:16:38

[of help give you a feel of you know like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m40s)
01:16:40

[how you might go about like writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m45s)
01:16:45

[writing code quickly in this notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m47s)
01:16:47

[environment right and this is the kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m50s)
01:16:50

[of stuff that you're going to need to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m52s)
01:16:52

[able to do you know in the real world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m53s)
01:16:53

[and in the exam is kind of quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m55s)
01:16:55

[create the kind of code that we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m57s)
01:16:57

[to talk about so I really like creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h16m58s)
01:16:58

[synthetic datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m03s)
01:17:03

[anytime I'm trying to like investigate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m04s)
01:17:04

[the behavior of something because if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m06s)
01:17:06

[have a synthetic data set I know how it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m08s)
01:17:08

[should behave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m10s)
01:17:10

[which reminds me before we do this I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m12s)
01:17:12

[promised that we would talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m16s)
01:17:16

[interaction importance and I just about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[forgot trie interpreter tells us the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[contributions for our particular row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m28s)
01:17:28

[based on the difference in the tree we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m31s)
01:17:31

[could calculate that for every road in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m36s)
01:17:36

[our data set and add them up right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[that would tell us that would tell us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m43s)
01:17:43

[feature importance and would tell us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m45s)
01:17:45

[feature importance in a different way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m48s)
01:17:48

[right one way of doing feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m49s)
01:17:49

[importance is by shuffling the columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m51s)
01:17:51

[one at a time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m53s)
01:17:53

[another way is by doing tree interpreter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[for every row and adding them up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h17m57s)
01:17:57

[neither is right more right than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m00s)
01:18:00

[others they're actually both quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m03s)
01:18:03

[widely used so this is kind of type 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m05s)
01:18:05

[and type 2 feature importance so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m07s)
01:18:07

[could try to expand this a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m15s)
01:18:15

[- do not just single variable feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m21s)
01:18:21

[importance but interaction feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m24s)
01:18:24

[importance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m27s)
01:18:27

[now here's the thing what I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m29s)
01:18:29

[describe is very easy to describe it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m32s)
01:18:32

[described by Bremen right back when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m36s)
01:18:36

[random forests were first invented and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m38s)
01:18:38

[it is part of the commercial software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m40s)
01:18:40

[product from Salford systems who have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m44s)
01:18:44

[the trademark on random forests but it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m46s)
01:18:46

[is not part of any open-source library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m50s)
01:18:50

[I'm aware of and I've never seen an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m52s)
01:18:52

[academic paper that actually studies it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m55s)
01:18:55

[closely so what I'm going to describe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m57s)
01:18:57

[here is a huge opportunity but it's also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h18m59s)
01:18:59

[like there's lots and lots of details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m04s)
01:19:04

[that kind of need to be fleshed out but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m06s)
01:19:06

[here's the basic idea this particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m08s)
01:19:08

[this particular difference here right is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m15s)
01:19:15

[not just because of year made but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m23s)
01:19:23

[because of a combination of year made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m26s)
01:19:26

[and enclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m28s)
01:19:28

[right the fact that this is 9.7 is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m31s)
01:19:31

[because enclosure was in this branch and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m34s)
01:19:34

[year made was in this branch so in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m37s)
01:19:37

[words we could say the contribution of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m39s)
01:19:39

[enclosure interacted with year made is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m43s)
01:19:43

[minus 0.3 yeah and so what about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h19m50s)
01:19:50

[difference well that's an interaction of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[year made and hours on the meter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m04s)
01:20:04

[so you made interacted with am using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m07s)
01:20:07

[star here not to mean times but to mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m11s)
01:20:11

[interacted with it's a it's a kind of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m14s)
01:20:14

[common way of doing things like ours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[formulas do it this way as well here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m18s)
01:20:18

[made by interacted with meter has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[import has a importance sorry a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m24s)
01:20:24

[contribution of minus 0.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m27s)
01:20:27

[perhaps we could also say from here to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m33s)
01:20:33

[here that this also shows an interaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m37s)
01:20:37

[between meter and enclosure like with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m41s)
01:20:41

[one thing in between them so maybe we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m44s)
01:20:44

[could say meter by enclosure equals and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m47s)
01:20:47

[then what should it be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m54s)
01:20:54

[you know should it be 0.6 I sorry minus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m55s)
01:20:55

[0.6 I mean some ways that kinda seems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h20m59s)
01:20:59

[unfair because we're also including like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m03s)
01:21:03

[the impact of a vm aid right so maybe it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m06s)
01:21:06

[should be maybe it should be minus 0.6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m10s)
01:21:10

[you know maybe we should add back this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m13s)
01:21:13

[point to right and these are like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m16s)
01:21:16

[details that I actually don't know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m19s)
01:21:19

[answer to right like how should we best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m21s)
01:21:21

[kind of assign a contribution to each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m26s)
01:21:26

[pair of variables in this path right but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[but clearly conceptually we can write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m33s)
01:21:33

[the pairs of variables in that path all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m36s)
01:21:36

[represent interactions all right yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m39s)
01:21:39

[Chris can you could you pass that to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m43s)
01:21:43

[Christmas why don't you first have to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m46s)
01:21:46

[next to each other in the tree I I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m48s)
01:21:48

[I'm not gonna say it's the wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m54s)
01:21:54

[approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m56s)
01:21:56

[I I don't think it's the right approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m56s)
01:21:56

[though because it feels like this path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h21m59s)
01:21:59

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m03s)
01:22:03

[Mayda and enclosure are interacting so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m03s)
01:22:03

[it seems like not recognizing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m08s)
01:22:08

[contribution is throwing away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m11s)
01:22:11

[information but I'm not sure you know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[had one of my staff at cattle actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m19s)
01:22:19

[do some R&amp;D on this a few years ago and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m21s)
01:22:21

[actually found you know and I wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m24s)
01:22:24

[close enough to know how they dealt with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m27s)
01:22:27

[these details but they got it working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m28s)
01:22:28

[pretty well but unfortunately it never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m29s)
01:22:29

[saw the light of day is a software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m32s)
01:22:32

[product but like this is something which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m33s)
01:22:33

[you know maybe a group of you could get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m36s)
01:22:36

[together and build you know I mean do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m38s)
01:22:38

[some googling to check but I really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m42s)
01:22:42

[don't think that there are any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m44s)
01:22:44

[interaction feature importance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m46s)
01:22:46

[parts of any open source library can you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m50s)
01:22:50

[cross the flip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m52s)
01:22:52

[wouldn't this exclude interactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m56s)
01:22:56

[though between variables that don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h22m59s)
01:22:59

[matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m01s)
01:23:01

[until they interact so say your road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m01s)
01:23:01

[never chooses to split down that path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m04s)
01:23:04

[but that variable interacting with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m07s)
01:23:07

[another one becomes your most important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[split I don't think that happens right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m11s)
01:23:11

[because if this if there's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m15s)
01:23:15

[interaction that's important only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m16s)
01:23:16

[because it's an interaction and not in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m18s)
01:23:18

[univariate basis it will appear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m20s)
01:23:20

[sometimes they cut assuming that you set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m22s)
01:23:22

[max features to less than one and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m25s)
01:23:25

[therefore it will appear in in some file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m27s)
01:23:27

[what is meant by indirection or is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m31s)
01:23:31

[multiplication ratio addition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m34s)
01:23:34

[interaction means appears branches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m36s)
01:23:36

[appears on the same path through a tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m42s)
01:23:42

[like an interaction in this case the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m46s)
01:23:46

[tree there's an interaction between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m49s)
01:23:49

[enclosure and ear made because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m50s)
01:23:50

[branched on enclosure and then we branch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m51s)
01:23:51

[on your mode so to get to here we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m54s)
01:23:54

[to have some specific value of enclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m56s)
01:23:56

[and some specific value of you made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h23m58s)
01:23:58

[sorry I just membranes kind of working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m03s)
01:24:03

[on this right now what if what if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m06s)
01:24:06

[went down the middle Leafs between the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m07s)
01:24:07

[two things you're trying to observe and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m10s)
01:24:10

[you could just sort of norm and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m12s)
01:24:12

[would also take into account what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m15s)
01:24:15

[final measure is so I mean if we extend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m16s)
01:24:16

[the tree downwards you'd have many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m18s)
01:24:18

[measures both of like the two things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m20s)
01:24:20

[you're trying to look at and also the in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m22s)
01:24:22

[between steps there seems to be a way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m24s)
01:24:24

[like average information out in between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m27s)
01:24:27

[them there could be so I think what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m29s)
01:24:29

[should do is talk about this on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m31s)
01:24:31

[forum I think this is fascinating and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m32s)
01:24:32

[hope we build something great but I need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m34s)
01:24:34

[to do my live coding so let's yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m39s)
01:24:39

[that's a great discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m42s)
01:24:42

[thinking about it and news of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m47s)
01:24:47

[experiments and so to experiment with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m49s)
01:24:49

[that you almost certainly want to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m51s)
01:24:51

[a synthetic data set first right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m54s)
01:24:54

[it's like y equals X 1 plus X 2 plus X 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h24m57s)
01:24:57

[times X 2 or something you know like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[something where you know there's this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m03s)
01:25:03

[interaction effect and there isn't that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m05s)
01:25:05

[interaction effect and then you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m07s)
01:25:07

[make sure that the feature importance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m08s)
01:25:08

[you get at the end is what you expected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m10s)
01:25:10

[right and so probably the first step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m13s)
01:25:13

[would be to do single variable feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m15s)
01:25:15

[importance using the tree interpreter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m19s)
01:25:19

[style approach and one nice thing about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m23s)
01:25:23

[this is like it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m27s)
01:25:27

[it doesn't really matter how much data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m31s)
01:25:31

[you have like all you have to do to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m32s)
01:25:32

[calculate feature importance is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m34s)
01:25:34

[like slide through the tree right so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m35s)
01:25:35

[should be able to write in a way that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m38s)
01:25:38

[actually pretty fast and so even writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m39s)
01:25:39

[it in pure Python might be fast enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m41s)
01:25:41

[depending on your tree size okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m44s)
01:25:44

[we're going to talk about extrapolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m49s)
01:25:49

[and so the first thing I want to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m52s)
01:25:52

[create a synthetic data set that has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m53s)
01:25:53

[simple linear relationship we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m55s)
01:25:55

[to pretend it's like a time series right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h25m58s)
01:25:58

[so we need to basically create some X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m01s)
01:26:01

[values so the easiest way to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m04s)
01:26:04

[create some synthetic data of this type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m06s)
01:26:06

[is to use linspace which just creates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m09s)
01:26:09

[some evenly spaced some evenly spaced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m12s)
01:26:12

[data right between start and stop with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m15s)
01:26:15

[by default 50 observations so if we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m19s)
01:26:19

[do that right there it is okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m22s)
01:26:22

[and so then we're going to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m30s)
01:26:30

[dependent variable and so let's assume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m34s)
01:26:34

[there's just a linear relationship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m36s)
01:26:36

[between x and y and let's add a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m37s)
01:26:37

[bit of randomness to it right so uniform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m41s)
01:26:41

[random between low and high so we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m47s)
01:26:47

[like add somewhere between like minus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m50s)
01:26:50

[0.2 and 0.2 say okay and so the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h26m55s)
01:26:55

[thing we need is is a shape right which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m03s)
01:27:03

[is basically how what dimensions do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m07s)
01:27:07

[want this this randomness these random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m10s)
01:27:10

[numbers to be and obviously we want them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m12s)
01:27:12

[to be the same shape as X's shape so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m14s)
01:27:14

[can just say X dot shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m17s)
01:27:17

[okay so in other words that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m20s)
01:27:20

[xscape remember when you see something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m24s)
01:27:24

[in parentheses with a comma that's at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m27s)
01:27:27

[Apple with just one thing in it okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m29s)
01:27:29

[this is of shape 15 and so we've added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m33s)
01:27:33

[50 random numbers and so now we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m37s)
01:27:37

[plot those okay so shift-tab x comma y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m40s)
01:27:40

[all right so there's no data okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m53s)
01:27:53

[like when you were both working as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h27m57s)
01:27:57

[data scientist or for doing your exams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m01s)
01:28:01

[in this course you need to be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m03s)
01:28:03

[like quickly whip up a data set like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m05s)
01:28:05

[that throw it up in our plot without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m07s)
01:28:07

[thinking too much okay and like as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m09s)
01:28:09

[can see you don't have to really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m13s)
01:28:13

[remember much if anything you just have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m14s)
01:28:14

[to know how to like hit shift I have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m17s)
01:28:17

[check the names of parameters and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m19s)
01:28:19

[know everything in the exam will be open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m22s)
01:28:22

[up and broke up and internet so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m24s)
01:28:24

[always like google her something to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m26s)
01:28:26

[and find linspace if you forgot what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m28s)
01:28:28

[it's called all right so let's assume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m30s)
01:28:30

[that's out data all right and so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m34s)
01:28:34

[now going to build a random first model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m37s)
01:28:37

[and what I want to do is build a random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m41s)
01:28:41

[first model that kind of acts as if this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m43s)
01:28:43

[is a time series so I'm going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m45s)
01:28:45

[this as a training set right I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m49s)
01:28:49

[to take of this as our validation or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m53s)
01:28:53

[test set just like we did in you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m56s)
01:28:56

[groceries or bulldozers or whatever okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h28m59s)
01:28:59

[so we can use exactly the same kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m04s)
01:29:04

[code that we used in split bells right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m07s)
01:29:07

[so we can basically say X train comma X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m09s)
01:29:09

[tau equals x up to 40 comma X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m14s)
01:29:14

[from 40 okay so that just fits it into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m26s)
01:29:26

[the first audio since the last 10 right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m31s)
01:29:31

[and so we can do the same thing for Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m34s)
01:29:34

[and there we go okay so the next thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m36s)
01:29:36

[to do is we want to create a random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m47s)
01:29:47

[forest okay and fit it and that's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m49s)
01:29:49

[to require X's and Y's all right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h29m57s)
01:29:57

[that's actually going to give an error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m00s)
01:30:00

[and the reason why is that it expects X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m02s)
01:30:02

[to be a matrix not a vector because it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m05s)
01:30:05

[expects X to have a number of columns of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m10s)
01:30:10

[data right so it's important to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m12s)
01:30:12

[that a matrix with one column is not the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m15s)
01:30:15

[same thing as a vector all right so if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m20s)
01:30:20

[try to run this right expect a 2d array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m22s)
01:30:22

[got 1d array instead so we need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m28s)
01:30:28

[convert our 2d array into a 1d array so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m32s)
01:30:32

[remember I said X dot shape is 50 comma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m35s)
01:30:35

[right so X has one axis so here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[important to measure X is rank is 1 the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m46s)
01:30:46

[rank of a variable is equal to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m52s)
01:30:52

[length of its shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m55s)
01:30:55

[how many axes does it have so a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h30m58s)
01:30:58

[we can think of as an array of Rank 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m02s)
01:31:02

[matrix as an array of Rank 2 I very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m06s)
01:31:06

[rarely used words like vector and matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m11s)
01:31:11

[because like they're kind of meaningless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m14s)
01:31:14

[specific examples of something more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m19s)
01:31:19

[general which is they're all n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m21s)
01:31:21

[dimensional tensors right or n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m23s)
01:31:23

[dimensional arrays ok so an n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m26s)
01:31:26

[dimensional array we can say it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m29s)
01:31:29

[tensor of Rank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m32s)
01:31:32

[they basically mean kind of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m35s)
01:31:35

[thing physicists get crazy when you say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m38s)
01:31:38

[that because to a physicist a tensor has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m40s)
01:31:40

[quite a specific meaning but in machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m42s)
01:31:42

[learning we generally use it in the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m44s)
01:31:44

[way okay so how do we turn an array a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m46s)
01:31:46

[one-dimensional array into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m53s)
01:31:53

[two-dimensional array there's a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m55s)
01:31:55

[of ways we can do it but basically we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h31m58s)
01:31:58

[slice it right so colon means give me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m00s)
01:32:00

[everything in that axis right colon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m04s)
01:32:04

[comma none means give me everything in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m09s)
01:32:09

[the first axis which is the only axis we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m12s)
01:32:12

[have and then none is a special indexer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m14s)
01:32:14

[which means add a unit axis here so let](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m17s)
01:32:17

[me show you that is a sort of shape 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m22s)
01:32:22

[comma one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m27s)
01:32:27

[so it's a prank - it has two axes one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m29s)
01:32:29

[them is a very boring access right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m34s)
01:32:34

[it's a length one access so let's move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m36s)
01:32:36

[this over here there's 1 comma 50 ok and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m39s)
01:32:39

[then to remind you the original is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m45s)
01:32:45

[50 right so you can see I can put none](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m50s)
01:32:50

[as a special indexer to introduce a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m53s)
01:32:53

[unit axis there ok so this thing has one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h32m58s)
01:32:58

[row in 50 columns this thing has 50 rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m04s)
01:33:04

[of one column so that's what we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m08s)
01:33:08

[right we want 50 rows and one column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m11s)
01:33:11

[this kind of playing around with ranks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m14s)
01:33:14

[and dimensions is going to become](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m20s)
01:33:20

[increasingly important in this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m21s)
01:33:21

[and in the deep learning course right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m24s)
01:33:24

[I spend a lot of time slicing with non](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m27s)
01:33:27

[slicing with other things try to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m30s)
01:33:30

[three dimensional four dimensional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m32s)
01:33:32

[chances and so forth I'll show you a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m34s)
01:33:34

[trick I'll show you two tricks the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m35s)
01:33:35

[is you never ever need to write karma :](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m37s)
01:33:37

[it's always assumed so if I delete that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m40s)
01:33:40

[this is exactly the same thing okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m43s)
01:33:43

[you'll see that in code all the time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m47s)
01:33:47

[you need to recognize it the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m50s)
01:33:50

[trick is this is adding an axis in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m52s)
01:33:52

[second dimension right or I guess the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m55s)
01:33:55

[index one dimension what if I always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h33m58s)
01:33:58

[want to put it in the last dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m01s)
01:34:01

[right and like often our tensors change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m02s)
01:34:02

[dimensions without us looking because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m05s)
01:34:05

[like you went from a one channel image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m07s)
01:34:07

[to a three channel image or you went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m10s)
01:34:10

[from a single image to a mini batch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m13s)
01:34:13

[images like suddenly you get new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m14s)
01:34:14

[dimensions appearing so to make things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m16s)
01:34:16

[general I would say this dot dot dot dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m18s)
01:34:18

[dot dot means as many dimensions as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[need to fill this up okay and so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m25s)
01:34:25

[case it's exactly the same thing but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m28s)
01:34:28

[would always try to write it that way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m30s)
01:34:30

[because it means it's going to continue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m32s)
01:34:32

[to work as I get you know higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m34s)
01:34:34

[dimensional tenses alright so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m36s)
01:34:36

[case I want 50 rows in one column so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m39s)
01:34:39

[I'll call that say X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m42s)
01:34:42

[okay so let's now use that here and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m45s)
01:34:45

[this is now a 2d array and so I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m50s)
01:34:50

[create my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m53s)
01:34:53

[random forest okay so then I could plot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h34m59s)
01:34:59

[that and this is where you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m03s)
01:35:03

[have to turn your brains on because the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m07s)
01:35:07

[folks this morning got this very quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m10s)
01:35:10

[which was super impressive I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m11s)
01:35:11

[plot white rain against MDOT predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m14s)
01:35:14

[next rain okay before I hit go what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m20s)
01:35:20

[this going to look like yeah it should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m24s)
01:35:24

[basically be the same right a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m34s)
01:35:34

[predictions hopefully are the same as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m37s)
01:35:37

[the actuals so this should fall on a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m39s)
01:35:39

[line but there's some randomness so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m41s)
01:35:41

[won't quite I should have used scatter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m43s)
01:35:43

[plot okay all right so that's cool right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m45s)
01:35:45

[that was the easy one let's now do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m53s)
01:35:53

[hard one the fun one what's that going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h35m59s)
01:35:59

[to look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m09s)
01:36:09

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m12s)
01:36:12

[okay so I'm gonna say no but nice try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m18s)
01:36:18

[you know it's like hey we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m23s)
01:36:23

[extrapolating to the to the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m25s)
01:36:25

[that's what I'd like it to look like but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m27s)
01:36:27

[that's not what it is going to look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m29s)
01:36:29

[think about what trees do and think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m36s)
01:36:36

[about think about the fact that we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m40s)
01:36:40

[a validation set here and a training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m44s)
01:36:44

[here so think about a forest is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m46s)
01:36:46

[bunch of trees well the first tree is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m52s)
01:36:52

[going to okay Melissa is going to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m55s)
01:36:55

[go can you pass that to Melissa well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h36m57s)
01:36:57

[let's start grouping yeah that's what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m04s)
01:37:04

[mean that's what it does okay but you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m08s)
01:37:08

[know let's think about how it groups the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m10s)
01:37:10

[dots so yeah I'm guessing since all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m11s)
01:37:11

[new data is actually outside of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m16s)
01:37:16

[original scope it's all going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m17s)
01:37:17

[basically the same it's like one huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m19s)
01:37:19

[group yeah right so like we make it like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m21s)
01:37:21

[forget the forest let's create one tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m23s)
01:37:23

[right so we're probably going to split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m25s)
01:37:25

[somewhere around here first and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m27s)
01:37:27

[we're kind of probably split somewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m30s)
01:37:30

[around here and then we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m31s)
01:37:31

[split somewhere around here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m33s)
01:37:33

[somewhere around here right and so our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m34s)
01:37:34

[final split is here right so our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m36s)
01:37:36

[prediction when we say okay let's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m41s)
01:37:41

[this one and so it's going to put that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m44s)
01:37:44

[through the forest right and end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m47s)
01:37:47

[predicting this average it can't predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m52s)
01:37:52

[you anything higher than that because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m55s)
01:37:55

[there is nothing higher than that to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m57s)
01:37:57

[average right so this is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h37m59s)
01:37:59

[important to realize if a random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m00s)
01:38:00

[is not magic right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m02s)
01:38:02

[it's just returning the average of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m04s)
01:38:04

[nearby observations where nearby is kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m06s)
01:38:06

[of in this like tree space so let's run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m09s)
01:38:09

[it let's see if Tim's right but holy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m12s)
01:38:12

[shit that's awful right and like if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m18s)
01:38:18

[don't know how when firsts works and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m24s)
01:38:24

[this is going to totally screw right if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m26s)
01:38:26

[you think that it's actually going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m28s)
01:38:28

[able to extrapolate to any kind of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m30s)
01:38:30

[it hasn't seen before like particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m33s)
01:38:33

[like future time periods it's just not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m35s)
01:38:35

[like it just can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m38s)
01:38:38

[it's just averaging stuff it's already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m40s)
01:38:40

[seen that's all it can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m41s)
01:38:41

[okay so we're going to be talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m44s)
01:38:44

[like how to avoid this problem we talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m47s)
01:38:47

[a little bit in the last lesson about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m51s)
01:38:51

[trying to avoid it by just like in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m54s)
01:38:54

[avoiding unnecessary time dependent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h38m56s)

[variables where we can write but in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m02s)
01:39:02

[end if you really have a time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m05s)
01:39:05

[that looks like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m07s)
01:39:07

[we actually have to deal with a problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m10s)
01:39:10

[all right so one way we could deal with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m12s)
01:39:12

[the problem would be used like a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m15s)
01:39:15

[net right use something that actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m18s)
01:39:18

[has a function or shape that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m19s)
01:39:19

[actually like fit something that can she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m21s)
01:39:21

[fit something like this right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m26s)
01:39:26

[then it will extrapolate nicely another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m28s)
01:39:28

[approach would be to use all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m31s)
01:39:31

[series techniques you guys are learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m33s)
01:39:33

[about in the morning class to fit some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m34s)
01:39:34

[kind of time series right and then D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m37s)
01:39:37

[trend it right and so then you'll end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m40s)
01:39:40

[with D trended dots and then use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m43s)
01:39:43

[random chorus to predict those right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m46s)
01:39:46

[that's particularly cool right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m49s)
01:39:49

[if you're like imagine that your random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m51s)
01:39:51

[forest was actually trying to predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m54s)
01:39:54

[data that like I don't know maybe it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h39m57s)
01:39:57

[two different states and so the blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m01s)
01:40:01

[ones you know that down here and the red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m03s)
01:40:03

[ones are up here right now if you try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m07s)
01:40:07

[use a random forest it's going to do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m10s)
01:40:10

[pretty crappy job because like time is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m12s)
01:40:12

[going to see much more important so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m15s)
01:40:15

[basically still gonna like split like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m16s)
01:40:16

[this and it's going to split like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m19s)
01:40:19

[and then finally once it kind of gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m21s)
01:40:21

[down to this piece it'll be like oh okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m23s)
01:40:23

[now I can see the difference between the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m25s)
01:40:25

[states right so in other words like when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m26s)
01:40:26

[you've got this big timepiece going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m29s)
01:40:29

[you're not gonna see the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m32s)
01:40:32

[relationships in the random forest until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m34s)
01:40:34

[you've dealt and kill every tree deals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m37s)
01:40:37

[with time so one way to fix this would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m40s)
01:40:40

[be with a gradient boosting machine GBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m43s)
01:40:43

[right now what a GBM does is it creates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m46s)
01:40:46

[a little tree right and runs everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m48s)
01:40:48

[through that first little tree which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m51s)
01:40:51

[could be like the time tree and then it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m53s)
01:40:53

[calculates the residuals and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m56s)
01:40:56

[next little tree just predicts the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h40m59s)
01:40:59

[residuals so it'd be kind of like D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m02s)
01:41:02

[trending it right so GPM has handle this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m04s)
01:41:04

[GBM still can't extrapolate to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m06s)
01:41:06

[future but at least they can deal with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m08s)
01:41:08

[time-dependent data more conveniently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m11s)
01:41:11

[right so we're going to be talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m14s)
01:41:14

[this quite a lot more over the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m16s)
01:41:16

[couple of weeks right and in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m17s)
01:41:17

[that a solution is going to be just used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m19s)
01:41:19

[neural nets right but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m22s)
01:41:22

[for now you know using it some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m24s)
01:41:24

[time series analysis D trend it and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m26s)
01:41:26

[use a random forest on that isn't a bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m29s)
01:41:29

[technique at all and if you're playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m32s)
01:41:32

[around something like the Ecuador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m33s)
01:41:33

[groceries competition that would be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m35s)
01:41:35

[really good thing to to fiddle around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIYUvBRTpE#t=01h41m37s)
01:41:37
