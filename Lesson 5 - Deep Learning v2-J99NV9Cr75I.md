[welcome back so we had a busy lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m00s)
00:00:00

[last week and I was really thrilled to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m05s)
00:00:05

[see actually one of our masters students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m11s)
00:00:11

[here at USF actually actually took what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m14s)
00:00:14

[we learned took what we learned with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m18s)
00:00:18

[structured deep learning and turned it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m23s)
00:00:23

[into a blog post which as I suspected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m25s)
00:00:25

[has been incredibly popular because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m28s)
00:00:28

[just something people didn't know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m30s)
00:00:30

[and so it actually ended up getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m33s)
00:00:33

[picked up by the towards data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m35s)
00:00:35

[publication which I quite liked actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m38s)
00:00:38

[if you're interested in keeping up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m40s)
00:00:40

[what's going on a data science it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m41s)
00:00:41

[quite good medium publication and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m43s)
00:00:43

[Karen talked about structured deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m46s)
00:00:46

[learning and basically introduced you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m50s)
00:00:50

[know the the the basic ideas that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m53s)
00:00:53

[learned about last week and it got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m55s)
00:00:55

[picked up quite quite widely one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h00m58s)
00:00:58

[one of the things I was pleased to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m01s)
00:01:01

[actually sebastian ruder who actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m02s)
00:01:02

[mentioned in last week's class as being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m04s)
00:01:04

[one of my favorite researchers tweeted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m06s)
00:01:06

[it and then somebody from stitch fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m09s)
00:01:09

[said oh yeah we've actually been doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m11s)
00:01:11

[that for ages which is kind of cute I I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m12s)
00:01:12

[kind of know that this is happening in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m16s)
00:01:16

[industry a lot and I've been telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m18s)
00:01:18

[people this is happening in industry a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m20s)
00:01:20

[lot but nobody's been talking about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m21s)
00:01:21

[and now the Karen's kind of published a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m23s)
00:01:23

[blog saying hey check out this cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m24s)
00:01:24

[thing and they all stitch fixes like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m26s)
00:01:26

[yeah we're doing that already so so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m28s)
00:01:28

[that's been great great to see and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m30s)
00:01:30

[think there's still a lot more that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m34s)
00:01:34

[be dug into with this structured people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m38s)
00:01:38

[learning stuff you know to build on top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m39s)
00:01:39

[of Karen's post would be that maybe like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m42s)
00:01:42

[experiment with some different datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m44s)
00:01:44

[maybe find some old careful competitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[and see like there's some competitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m48s)
00:01:48

[that you could now win with this or some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m50s)
00:01:50

[which doesn't work for would be equally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m53s)
00:01:53

[interesting and also like just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m55s)
00:01:55

[experimenting a bit with different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m58s)
00:01:58

[amounts of dropout different layer sizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h01m59s)
00:01:59

[you know because nobody much is written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m01s)
00:02:01

[about this I don't think there's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m05s)
00:02:05

[any blog posts about this before that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m07s)
00:02:07

[I've seen anywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m09s)
00:02:09

[there's a lot of unexplored territory so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m10s)
00:02:10

[I think there's a lot we could we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m13s)
00:02:13

[build on top of here and there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m16s)
00:02:16

[definitely a lot of interest as well one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m17s)
00:02:17

[person on Twitter saying this is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m19s)
00:02:19

[I've been looking for for ages another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m21s)
00:02:21

[thing which I was pleased to see is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m25s)
00:02:25

[Nikki or who we saw his cricket versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m27s)
00:02:27

[baseball predictor as well as his a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m31s)
00:02:31

[currency predictor after less than one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m33s)
00:02:33

[went on to download something a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m36s)
00:02:36

[bigger which was to download a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m40s)
00:02:40

[hundred of images of actors and he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m43s)
00:02:43

[manually went through and checked which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[well I think first of all he like used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m48s)
00:02:48

[Google to try and find ones with glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m50s)
00:02:50

[and ones without then he manually went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[through and checked that that they put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m53s)
00:02:53

[in the right spot and this was a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m55s)
00:02:55

[example of one where vanilla ResNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h02m57s)
00:02:57

[didn't do so well with just the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m00s)
00:03:00

[layer and so what Nikhil did was he went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m01s)
00:03:01

[through and tried on freezing the layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m06s)
00:03:06

[and using differential learning rates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m07s)
00:03:07

[and got up to a hundred percent accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m09s)
00:03:09

[and the thing I like about these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m11s)
00:03:11

[that Nikhil was doing is the way he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[he's not downloading a kegel data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m15s)
00:03:15

[he's like deciding on a problem that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[he's going to try and solve he's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m20s)
00:03:20

[from scratch from google and he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[actually got a link here even to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m24s)
00:03:24

[suggested way to help you download](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[images from Google so I think this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m28s)
00:03:28

[great and actually gave a talk just this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m30s)
00:03:30

[afternoon at singularity University to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m33s)

00:03:36

[largest telecommunications companies and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m38s)
00:03:38

[actually show them this post because the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m40s)
00:03:40

[folks there were telling me that that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m43s)
00:03:43

[all the vendors that come to them and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m46s)
00:03:46

[tell them they need like millions of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[images and huge data centers will have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m50s)
00:03:50

[hardware and you know they have to buy a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m52s)
00:03:52

[special software that only these vendors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m53s)
00:03:53

[can provide and I said like actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m56s)
00:03:56

[this person has been doing it of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h03m58s)
00:03:58

[for three weeks now and look at what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m00s)
00:04:00

[he's just done with a computer that cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m01s)
00:04:01

[him 60 cents an hour and they were like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m04s)
00:04:04

[they were so happy to hear that like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m06s)
00:04:06

[okay they're you know this actually is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m08s)
00:04:08

[in the reach of normal people I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m11s)
00:04:11

[assuming Nikhil is a normal person I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m13s)
00:04:13

[haven't actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m15s)
00:04:15

[and if your proudly abnormal Nicole I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m15s)
00:04:15

[apologize I actually went and actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m20s)
00:04:20

[had a look at his cricket classifier and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m23s)
00:04:23

[I was really pleased to see that his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m26s)
00:04:26

[code actually is the exact same code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[that were used in Lesson one I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m29s)
00:04:29

[hoping that would be the case you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m32s)
00:04:32

[the only thing he changed was the number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m33s)
00:04:33

[of epochs I guess so this idea that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m35s)
00:04:35

[can take those four lines of code and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m38s)
00:04:38

[reuse it to do other things that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m40s)
00:04:40

[definitely turned out to be true and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m41s)
00:04:41

[these are good things to show like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m44s)

[certain amount of like not to surprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m52s)
00:04:52

[but almost like pushback like if this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m55s)
00:04:55

[was true somebody does it all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m58s)

[message she said if this was true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h04m59s)

[somebody would have told us so like why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m00s)

[isn't everybody doing this already so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m02s)
00:05:02

[we'd like it I think you might have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m04s)
00:05:04

[actually show them you know maybe you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m05s)
00:05:05

[can build your own there's some internal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m08s)

00:05:36

[learn from you know from his post about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m37s)
00:05:37

[about good technical writing what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m40s)
00:05:40

[really like particularly is that he he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m43s)
00:05:43

[assumes almost nothing like he has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m46s)
00:05:46

[kind of a very chatty tone and describes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m48s)
00:05:48

[everything but he also assumes that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m50s)
00:05:50

[reader is intelligent but you know so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m52s)
00:05:52

[like he's not afraid to kind of say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m54s)
00:05:54

[here's a paper or here's an equation or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[or whatever but then he's going to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m57s)
00:05:57

[through and tell you exactly what that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h05m59s)
00:05:59

[equation means so it's kind of like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m00s)
00:06:00

[nice mix of like writing for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m03s)
00:06:03

[respectfully for an intelligent audience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m06s)
00:06:06

[but also not assuming any particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m08s)
00:06:08

[background knowledge so then I made the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m11s)

[product top six are all fast AI students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m35s)
00:06:35

[or in the worst of those teachers and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m38s)
00:06:38

[I think this is like a really Oh James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m42s)
00:06:42

[is just passed he was first this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m45s)
00:06:45

[really good example of like what you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m48s)
00:06:48

[do but this is trying to think it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m52s)
00:06:52

[like a small number of thousands of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m55s)
00:06:55

[images and most of the images were only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h06m58s)
00:06:58

[were less than a hundred pixels by a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m02s)
00:07:02

[hundred pixels and yet week you know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m04s)
00:07:04

[bet my approach was basically to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m09s)
00:07:09

[let's just run through the notebook we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m11s)
00:07:11

[have pretty much default took the I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m13s)
00:07:13

[don't know an hour and I'm I think the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m15s)
00:07:15

[other students doing a little bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m19s)
00:07:19

[than that but not a lot more and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m21s)
00:07:21

[basically what this is saying is yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m23s)
00:07:23

[these these techniques work pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m25s)
00:07:25

[reliably to a point where people that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m28s)
00:07:28

[aren't using the fast I know libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m30s)
00:07:30

[you know literally really struggling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m33s)
00:07:33

[let's just pick off these are first aid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m37s)
00:07:37

[a students might have to go down quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m40s)
00:07:40

[way so I thought that was very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m41s)
00:07:41

[interesting and really really cool so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m43s)
00:07:43

[today we are going to start what I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m48s)
00:07:48

[kind of call like the second half of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m52s)
00:07:52

[this course so the first half of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m55s)
00:07:55

[course is being like getting through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h07m58s)
00:07:58

[like these are the applications that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m01s)
00:08:01

[can use this for here's kind of the code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m04s)
00:08:04

[you have to write here's a fairly high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[level ish description of what it's doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m10s)
00:08:10

[and we're kind of we're kind of done for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[that bit and what we're now going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m17s)
00:08:17

[is go in reverse we're going to go back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m19s)
00:08:19

[over all of those exact same things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m21s)
00:08:21

[again but this time we're going to dig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m23s)
00:08:23

[into the detail of every one and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m25s)
00:08:25

[going to look inside the source code of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[the first idea library to see what it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[doing and try to replicate that so in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m30s)
00:08:30

[students like there's not going to be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m35s)
00:08:35

[lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m38s)
00:08:38

[best practices to show you like I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m41s)
00:08:41

[kind of shown you the best best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m43s)
00:08:43

[practices I know but I feel like for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m45s)
00:08:45

[to now build on top of those to debug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m47s)
00:08:47

[those models to come back to part two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[where we're going to kind of try out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m52s)
00:08:52

[some new things you know it really helps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m54s)
00:08:54

[to understand what's going on behind the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m56s)
00:08:56

[scenes okay so the goal here today is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h08m58s)
00:08:58

[we're going to try and create a pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m02s)
00:09:02

[effective collaborative filtering model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m06s)
00:09:06

[almost entirely from scratch so we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m09s)
00:09:09

[use the kind of we'll use PI torch as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m13s)
00:09:13

[automatic differentiation tool and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m15s)
00:09:15

[there's a GPU programming tool and not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m17s)
00:09:17

[very much else we'll try not to use its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m19s)
00:09:19

[neural net features we'll try not to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m21s)
00:09:21

[fast AI library anymore than necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m23s)
00:09:23

[so that's the goal so let's go back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m26s)
00:09:26

[you know we only very quickly know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m30s)
00:09:30

[collaborative filtering last time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m31s)
00:09:31

[let's let's go back and have a look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m33s)
00:09:33

[collaborative filtering and so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m35s)
00:09:35

[going to look at this movie lens data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[set so the movie lens data set basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m40s)
00:09:40

[is a list of ratings it's got a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m47s)
00:09:47

[different users that are represented by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[some ID and a bunch of movies that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m51s)
00:09:51

[represented by some ID and rating it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m54s)
00:09:54

[also has a timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m57s)
00:09:57

[I haven't actually ever tried to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h09m58s)
00:09:58

[this I guess this is just like what what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[time did that person read that movie so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m02s)
00:10:02

[that's all we're going to use for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m07s)
00:10:07

[modelling is three columns user ID movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m09s)
00:10:09

[ID and rating and so thinking of that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m13s)
00:10:13

[kind of structured data terms user ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m16s)
00:10:16

[and movie ID would be categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m18s)
00:10:18

[variables we have two of them and rating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m20s)
00:10:20

[would be a with the independent variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m23s)
00:10:23

[we're not going to use this for modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m28s)
00:10:28

[but we can use it for looking at stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m30s)
00:10:30

[later we can grab a list of the names of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m32s)
00:10:32

[the movies as well and reproduce this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m35s)
00:10:35

[genre information I haven't tried to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m37s)
00:10:37

[interested if during the week anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m40s)
00:10:40

[tries it and finds it helpful my guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m42s)
00:10:42

[is you might not find it helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m44s)
00:10:44

[we'll see so in order to kind of look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m46s)
00:10:46

[this better I just grabbed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[the users that have watched the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m55s)
00:10:55

[movies and the movies that have been the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m57s)
00:10:57

[most watched and made a crosstab of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h10m59s)
00:10:59

[right so this is exactly the same data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m03s)
00:11:03

[but it's a subset and now rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m05s)
00:11:05

[being user movie rating we've got user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m08s)
00:11:08

[movie rating and so some users haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m11s)
00:11:11

[watched some of these movies that's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m16s)
00:11:16

[some of these okay then I copied that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m19s)
00:11:19

[into Excel and you'll see there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m23s)
00:11:23

[thing called collab your XLS if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m27s)
00:11:27

[don't see it there now I'll make sure I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m31s)
00:11:31

[put it there back tomorrow and here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[where I've copied that table okay so as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m37s)
00:11:37

[I go through this like setup of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m43s)
00:11:43

[problem and kind of how its described](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m46s)
00:11:46

[and stuff if you're ever feeling lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m47s)
00:11:47

[feel free to ask either directly or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h11m50s)

00:12:07

[kind of that's we're digging in to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m09s)
00:12:09

[details of what's going on behind the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m11s)
00:12:11

[scenes it's kind of important that at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[each stage you feel like okay I can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m14s)
00:12:14

[what's going on okay so we can actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m16s)
00:12:16

[not going to build a neural net to start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m26s)
00:12:26

[with instead we're going to do something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m29s)
00:12:29

[called a matrix factorization the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[we're not going to build a neural net to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m36s)
00:12:36

[start with is that it so happens there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m38s)
00:12:38

[a really really simple kind of way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m39s)
00:12:39

[solving these kinds of problems which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m43s)
00:12:43

[I'm going to show you and so if I scroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m44s)
00:12:44

[down I've basically what I've got here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m47s)
00:12:47

[is the same the same thing but this time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m50s)
00:12:50

[these are my predictions rather than my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m53s)
00:12:53

[actuals and I'm going to show you how I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m56s)
00:12:56

[created these predictions okay so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m57s)
00:12:57

[my actuals right here my predictions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h12m59s)
00:12:59

[then down here we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m03s)
00:13:03

[our score which is the sum of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m07s)
00:13:07

[different squared average square root](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m11s)
00:13:11

[okay so this is I are MSE down here okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[so on average we're randomly initialized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m18s)
00:13:18

[model is out by 2.8 so let me show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m22s)
00:13:22

[what this model is and I'm going to show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m25s)
00:13:25

[you by saying how do we guess how much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m28s)
00:13:28

[user ID number 14 likes movie ID number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m30s)
00:13:30

[27 and the prediction here this is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m35s)
00:13:35

[at this stage this is still random is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m39s)
00:13:39

[0.9 1 so how we calculate 0.9 1 and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m41s)
00:13:41

[answer is we're taking it as this vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m46s)
00:13:46

[here dot product with this vector here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m50s)
00:13:50

[so dot product means 0.71 times 0.1 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m55s)
00:13:55

[plus 0.8 1 times point 6 3 plus point 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h13m59s)
00:13:59

[volt plus point 3 1 and so forth and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m03s)
00:14:03

[you know linear algebra speak because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m05s)
00:14:05

[one of them is a column and one of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m08s)
00:14:08

[is a row this is the same as a matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m09s)
00:14:09

[product so you can see here I've used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m11s)
00:14:11

[the Excel fashion matrix multiplier and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m13s)
00:14:13

[that's my prediction having said that if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m17s)
00:14:17

[the original rating doesn't exist at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m21s)
00:14:21

[then I'm just going to set this to 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m28s)
00:14:28

[right because like there's no error in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m30s)
00:14:30

[predicting something that hasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m33s)
00:14:33

[happened okay so what I'm going to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m34s)
00:14:34

[I'm basically going to say alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m37s)
00:14:37

[everyone of my right rate my predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m38s)
00:14:38

[is not going to be a neural net it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[going to be a single matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m43s)
00:14:43

[multiplication all right now the matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m45s)
00:14:45

[multiplication that it's doing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[basically in practice is between like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m51s)
00:14:51

[this matrix and this matrix right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h14m54s)
00:14:54

[each one of these is a single part of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m02s)
00:15:02

[that so I randomly initialize these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m04s)
00:15:04

[these are just random numbers that I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m11s)
00:15:11

[just pasted in here so I've basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[started off with two random matrices and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[I've said let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m20s)
00:15:20

[assume for the time being that every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m21s)
00:15:21

[rating can be represented as the matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m24s)
00:15:24

[product of those two so then in Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m27s)
00:15:27

[you can actually do a gradient descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m31s)
00:15:31

[you have to go to your options to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m36s)
00:15:36

[add-ins section and check the box to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m39s)
00:15:39

[turn it on and once you do you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m41s)
00:15:41

[there's something there called solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[and if I go solver it says okay what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m44s)
00:15:44

[your objective function and you just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m47s)
00:15:47

[choose the cell so in this case we chose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m51s)
00:15:51

[the cell that contains that repeats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m54s)
00:15:54

[grade error and then it says okay what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m56s)
00:15:56

[do you want to change and you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h15m59s)
00:15:59

[here we've selected this matrix and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m02s)
00:16:02

[matrix and so it's going to do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m05s)
00:16:05

[gradient descent for us by changing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m07s)
00:16:07

[these matrices to try and in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[minimize this min minimize this Excel so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m12s)
00:16:12

[right GRG nonlinear is a gradient just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m16s)
00:16:16

[yet so I'll say solve and you'll see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m20s)
00:16:20

[starts at 2.8 and then down here you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m23s)
00:16:23

[see that numbers drain down it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m26s)
00:16:26

[actually showing us what it's doing but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m29s)
00:16:29

[we can see that the numbers going down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m30s)
00:16:30

[so this has kind of got a near or nettie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m32s)
00:16:32

[feel to it in that we're doing like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m37s)
00:16:37

[matrix product and we're doing a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m39s)
00:16:39

[gradient descent but we don't have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m41s)
00:16:41

[nonlinear layer and we don't have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m43s)
00:16:43

[second linear layer on top of that so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m46s)
00:16:46

[don't get to call this deep learning so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m49s)
00:16:49

[things where people do like deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m51s)
00:16:51

[learning each things where they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m53s)
00:16:53

[kind of matrix products and gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m55s)
00:16:55

[descents but it's not deep people tend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h16m58s)
00:16:58

[to just call that shallow learning okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m00s)
00:17:00

[so we're doing this chattering yeah all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m01s)
00:17:01

[right so I'm just going to go ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m05s)
00:17:05

[press escape to stop it because I'm sick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m06s)
00:17:06

[of waiting and so you can see we've now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m07s)
00:17:07

[got down to the 0.39 all right so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m12s)
00:17:12

[example it guessed that movie 72 for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m17s)
00:17:17

[sorry movie 27 for user seventy two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m22s)
00:17:22

[would get 4.4 for rating 2772 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m24s)
00:17:24

[actually got a four ready so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m30s)
00:17:30

[like it's it's it's doing something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m32s)
00:17:32

[quite useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m34s)
00:17:34

[so why is it doing something quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m36s)
00:17:36

[useful I mean something to note here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m40s)
00:17:40

[the number of things we're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m42s)
00:17:42

[predict here is there's 225 of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m45s)
00:17:45

[right and the number of things we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m48s)
00:17:48

[using to predict is that times two so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m51s)
00:17:51

[hundred and fifty of them so it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m54s)
00:17:54

[like we can just exactly fit we actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m56s)
00:17:56

[have to do some kind of machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h17m57s)
00:17:57

[here so basically what this is saying is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m00s)
00:18:00

[that there does seem to be some way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m03s)
00:18:03

[making predictions in this way and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m06s)
00:18:06

[for those of you that have done some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m11s)
00:18:11

[linear algebra and this is actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m12s)
00:18:12

[matrix decomposition normally in linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m14s)
00:18:14

[algebra you would do this using a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m17s)
00:18:17

[analytical technique or using some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m19s)
00:18:19

[techniques that are specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m22s)
00:18:22

[designed for this purpose but the nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m23s)
00:18:23

[thing is that we can use gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m25s)
00:18:25

[descent to solve pretty much everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m27s)
00:18:27

[including this I don't like to so much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m29s)
00:18:29

[think of it from a linear algebra point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m32s)
00:18:32

[of view though I like to think of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m33s)
00:18:33

[from an insured point of view which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m35s)
00:18:35

[this let's say movie sorry let's say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m36s)
00:18:36

[movie id 27 is Lord of the Rings part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m39s)
00:18:39

[and let's say move and so let's say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m45s)
00:18:45

[we're trying to make that prediction for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m51s)
00:18:51

[user 2072 are they going to like Lord of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m53s)
00:18:53

[the Rings part 1 and so conceptually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m56s)
00:18:56

[that particular movie maybe there's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h18m59s)
00:18:59

[this 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m02s)
00:19:02

[so there's 5 numbers here and we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[say like well what if the first one was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m07s)
00:19:07

[like how much is it sci-fi and fantasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m09s)
00:19:09

[and the second one is like how recent a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m11s)
00:19:11

[movie and how much special effects is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m15s)
00:19:15

[there you know and the one at the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m17s)
00:19:17

[might be like how dialogue-driven is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m19s)
00:19:19

[right like let's say those kind of five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m21s)
00:19:21

[these five numbers represented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m23s)
00:19:23

[particular things about the movie and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m25s)
00:19:25

[if that was the case then we could have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m27s)
00:19:27

[the same five numbers for the user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m30s)
00:19:30

[saying like ok how much does the use of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m32s)
00:19:32

[like sci-fi fantasy how much does the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[user like modern modern CGI driven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[movies how much does this give us a like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m42s)
00:19:42

[dialogue different movies and so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m45s)
00:19:45

[then took that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[cross-product you would expect to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[good model right would expect to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m51s)
00:19:51

[reasonable reading now the problem is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m53s)
00:19:53

[don't have this information for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m57s)
00:19:57

[user we don't have the information for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h19m58s)
00:19:58

[each movie so we're just going to like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m00s)
00:20:00

[assume that this is a reasonable kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m02s)
00:20:02

[way of thinking about this system and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m06s)
00:20:06

[let's unless stochastic gradient descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m08s)
00:20:08

[try and find these models right so so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m10s)
00:20:10

[other words these these factors we call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m13s)
00:20:13

[these things factors these factors and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m16s)
00:20:16

[we call them factors because you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m19s)
00:20:19

[multiply them together to create this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[not they're factors and how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m22s)
00:20:22

[addresses these factors we call them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m24s)
00:20:24

[latent factors because they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[actually this is not actually a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m29s)
00:20:29

[that we've like named and understood and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m33s)
00:20:33

[like entered in manually we've kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m36s)
00:20:36

[assumed that we can think of movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m38s)
00:20:38

[ratings this way we've assumed that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m41s)
00:20:41

[can think of them as a dot product of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m43s)
00:20:43

[some particular features about a movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m46s)
00:20:46

[and some particular features of to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[what users like those kinds of movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m51s)
00:20:51

[right and then we've used gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m53s)
00:20:53

[descent to just say okay try and find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m55s)
00:20:55

[some numbers that work so that's that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h20m58s)
00:20:58

[basically the technique right and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m03s)
00:21:03

[kind of the end and the entirety is in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m05s)
00:21:05

[this printing right so that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m09s)
00:21:09

[collaborative filtering using what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m10s)
00:21:10

[call probabilistic matrix factorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m12s)
00:21:12

[and as you can see the whole thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m14s)
00:21:14

[easy to do in an excel spreadsheet and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m17s)
00:21:17

[the entirety of it really is this single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m19s)
00:21:19

[thing which is a single matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m21s)
00:21:21

[multiplication plus randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m23s)
00:21:23

[initializing if it would be better to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m26s)
00:21:26

[cap this to 0 and 5 maybe yes yeah and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m32s)
00:21:32

[we're gonna do that later right there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m38s)
00:21:38

[a whole lot of stuff we can do to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m39s)
00:21:39

[improve this this is like our simple as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m41s)
00:21:41

[possible starting point all right so so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m44s)
00:21:44

[what we're going to do now is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m46s)
00:21:46

[going to try and implement this in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m47s)
00:21:47

[Python and run it on the whole data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m50s)
00:21:50

[another question is how do you figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m54s)
00:21:54

[out how many you know how it's clear how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h21m56s)
00:21:56

[long are the matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m00s)
00:22:00

[five yeah yeah so something to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m02s)
00:22:02

[about given that this is like movie 49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m05s)
00:22:05

[right and we're looking at a rating for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m09s)
00:22:09

[movie 49 think about this this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[actually at embedding matrix and so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m16s)
00:22:16

[length is actually the size of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m21s)
00:22:21

[embedding matrix I'm not saying this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m24s)
00:22:24

[an analogy I'm saying it literally this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m26s)
00:22:26

[is literally an embedding mattress we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m29s)
00:22:29

[could have a one hot encoding where 72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m31s)
00:22:31

[where a one is in the 72nd position and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m34s)
00:22:34

[so we'd like to look it up and it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m37s)
00:22:37

[return this list of five numbers so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m39s)
00:22:39

[question is actually how do we decide on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m43s)
00:22:43

[the dimensionality of our embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m45s)
00:22:45

[vectors and the answer to that question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m47s)
00:22:47

[is we have no idea we have to try a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m50s)
00:22:50

[things and see what was the underlying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m53s)
00:22:53

[concept is you need to pick an embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h22m57s)
00:22:57

[dimensionality which is enough to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m01s)
00:23:01

[reflect the kind of true complexity of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m04s)
00:23:04

[this causal system but not so big that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m06s)
00:23:06

[you have too many parameters that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m11s)
00:23:11

[could take forever to Tehran or even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m14s)
00:23:14

[with regularization in my overfit so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m16s)
00:23:16

[what does it mean when the factor is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m20s)
00:23:20

[negative that the factor being negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m23s)
00:23:23

[in the movie case would mean like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m27s)
00:23:27

[is not dialogue-driven in fact it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m30s)
00:23:30

[the opposite dialogue here is terrible a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m32s)
00:23:32

[negative for the user would be like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m34s)
00:23:34

[actually dislike modern CGI movies so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m37s)
00:23:37

[it's not from zero to whatever it's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m41s)
00:23:41

[range of score it'd be negative this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m44s)
00:23:44

[a range of score even like no net Maxim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m47s)
00:23:47

[no there's no constraints at all here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m49s)
00:23:49

[these are just standard embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m51s)
00:23:51

[matrices questions so first question is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h23m54s)
00:23:54

[why do what why can we trust this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m02s)
00:24:02

[embeddings because like if you take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m05s)
00:24:05

[number six it can be expressed as 1 into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m07s)
00:24:07

[6 or like 6 into 1 or 22 3 &amp; 3 into 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m09s)
00:24:09

[all so you're saying like we could like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m11s)
00:24:11

[reorder these higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m14s)
00:24:14

[hardly the value itself might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m17s)
00:24:17

[different as long as the product is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m19s)
00:24:19

[something well but you see we're using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m21s)
00:24:21

[gradient descent to find the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m23s)
00:24:23

[numbers so like once we've found a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m26s)
00:24:26

[minimum the idea is like yeah there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[other numbers but they don't give you as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m33s)
00:24:33

[good an objective value and of course we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m35s)
00:24:35

[should be checking that on a validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m39s)
00:24:39

[set really which we'll be doing in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m40s)
00:24:40

[Python version okay and the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m42s)
00:24:42

[question is when we have a new movie or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m44s)
00:24:44

[a new user to be a 30 trainer model that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m47s)
00:24:47

[is a really good question and there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m50s)
00:24:50

[isn't a straightforward answer to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[time permitting will come back but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m53s)
00:24:53

[basically you would need to have like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m56s)
00:24:56

[kind of a new user model or a new movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h24m58s)
00:24:58

[model that you would use initially and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[then over time yes you would then have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m05s)
00:25:05

[to retrain the model so like I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m08s)
00:25:08

[know if they still do it but Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m11s)
00:25:11

[used to have this thing that when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m12s)
00:25:12

[were first on boarded on Netflix it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m13s)
00:25:13

[would say like what movies do you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m15s)
00:25:15

[and you'd have to go through and let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m17s)
00:25:17

[say a bunch of movies you like and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m19s)
00:25:19

[would then my train is moral just find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[the nearest movie yeah you could use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m29s)
00:25:29

[nearest neighbors for sure but the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m34s)
00:25:34

[is initially at least in this case we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[have no columns to describe a movie so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m43s)
00:25:43

[if you had something about like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m47s)
00:25:47

[movies genre release date who was in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[or something you could have some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m51s)
00:25:51

[non collaborative filtering model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m53s)
00:25:53

[that's kind of what I meant a new movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m55s)
00:25:55

[model you have to have some some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h25m58s)
00:25:58

[predictors okay so a lot of this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m00s)
00:26:00

[going to look familiar and and the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m08s)
00:26:08

[I'm going to do this is again it's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m10s)
00:26:10

[of this top-down approach we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m12s)
00:26:12

[start using a few features of Pi torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m14s)
00:26:14

[and fast AI and gradually we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m17s)
00:26:17

[redo it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m20s)
00:26:20

[a few times in a few different ways kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m20s)
00:26:20

[of doing a little bit deeper each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m24s)
00:26:24

[um regardless we do need a validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m26s)
00:26:26

[set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m29s)
00:26:29

[so we can use our standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m30s)
00:26:30

[cross-validation indexes approach to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m31s)
00:26:31

[grab a random set of ID's this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[something called weight decay which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m39s)
00:26:39

[we'll talk about later in the course for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m41s)
00:26:41

[those of you that have done some machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m43s)
00:26:43

[learning it's l2 regularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m45s)
00:26:45

[basically and this is where we choose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m47s)
00:26:47

[how big a embedding matrix do we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m50s)
00:26:50

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m52s)
00:26:52

[so again you know here's where we get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m54s)
00:26:54

[our model data object from CSV passing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h26m57s)
00:26:57

[in that ratings file which remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m02s)
00:27:02

[looks like that okay so you'll see like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m06s)
00:27:06

[stuff tends to look pretty familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m10s)
00:27:10

[after a while and then you just have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m12s)
00:27:12

[pass in the what are your rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m17s)
00:27:17

[effectively what are your columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m22s)
00:27:22

[effectively and what are your values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m24s)
00:27:24

[effectively alright so any any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m25s)
00:27:25

[collaborative filtering recommendation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m28s)
00:27:28

[system approach there's basically a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m31s)
00:27:31

[concept of like you know a user and an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m32s)
00:27:32

[item now they might not be users and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[items like if you're doing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m39s)
00:27:39

[Ecuadorian groceries competition there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m40s)
00:27:40

[are stores and items and you're trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m43s)
00:27:43

[to predict how many things are you going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m45s)
00:27:45

[to sell at this store of this type but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m47s)
00:27:47

[generally speaking just this idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m53s)
00:27:53

[like you've got a couple of kind of high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m55s)
00:27:55

[cardinality categorical variables and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m57s)
00:27:57

[something that you're measuring and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h27m59s)
00:27:59

[you're kind of conceptualizing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m00s)
00:28:00

[saying okay we could predict the rating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m02s)
00:28:02

[we can predict the value by doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m05s)
00:28:05

[this dot for that interestingly this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m08s)
00:28:08

[kind of relevant to that that last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m12s)
00:28:12

[question or suggestion an identical way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[to think about this what I've expressed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[this is to say when we're deciding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[whether user 72 will like movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m23s)
00:28:23

[twenty-seven it's basically saying which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m26s)
00:28:26

[other users liked movies that 72 liked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m30s)
00:28:30

[and which other movies were liked by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m36s)
00:28:36

[people like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m40s)
00:28:40

[user 72 it turns out that these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m43s)
00:28:43

[basically two ways of saying the exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m46s)
00:28:46

[same thing so basically what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m49s)
00:28:49

[collaborative filtering is doing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m50s)
00:28:50

[know kind of conceptually is to say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m53s)
00:28:53

[this movie and this user which other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m56s)
00:28:56

[movies are similar to it in terms of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h28m59s)
00:28:59

[like similar people enjoyed them and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m01s)
00:29:01

[which people are similar to this person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m04s)
00:29:04

[based on people that like the same kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m07s)
00:29:07

[of movies so that's kind of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[underlying structure at any time there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m11s)
00:29:11

[an underlying structure like this that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m14s)
00:29:14

[kind of collaborative filtering approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m16s)
00:29:16

[is likely to be useful okay so so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m17s)
00:29:17

[yeah so there's basically two parts the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m22s)
00:29:22

[two bits of your thing that you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m25s)
00:29:25

[factoring and then the the value of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[dependent variable so as per usual we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[can take our model data and ask for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m31s)
00:29:31

[learner from it and we need to tell it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m34s)
00:29:34

[what size of any matrix to use how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m36s)
00:29:36

[sorry what validation set index is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m39s)
00:29:39

[use what batch size to use and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[optimizer to use and we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[talking more about optimizes surely we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m47s)
00:29:47

[want to Adam today Adam next week or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m51s)
00:29:51

[week after and then we can go ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m54s)
00:29:54

[say fit alright and it all looks pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h29m57s)
00:29:57

[similar interest is usually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m00s)
00:30:00

[interestingly I only had to do three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m03s)
00:30:03

[pops like this kind of model seem to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m05s)
00:30:05

[Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m08s)
00:30:08

[super quickly you can use the learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m08s)
00:30:08

[rate finder as per usual all the stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m11s)
00:30:11

[you're familiar with will work fine and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m13s)
00:30:13

[that was it so this talk you know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m15s)
00:30:15

[two seconds the Train there's no free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[trained anything's here this is from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m21s)
00:30:21

[random from scratch okay so this is our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m22s)
00:30:22

[validation set and we can compare it we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m27s)
00:30:27

[have this is a mean squared error not a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m29s)
00:30:29

[root mean squared error so we can take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m31s)
00:30:31

[square root so with that last time I ran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m33s)
00:30:33

[it was point seven seven six and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m37s)
00:30:37

[0.88 and there's some benchmarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m39s)
00:30:39

[available for this data set and when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m42s)
00:30:42

[scrolled through and found the bench the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m45s)
00:30:45

[best benchmark I could find here from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m46s)
00:30:46

[this recommendation system specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m48s)
00:30:48

[library they had point nine one so we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m51s)
00:30:51

[got a better loss in two seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m54s)
00:30:54

[already so that's good so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h30m58s)
00:30:58

[basically how you can do collaborative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m03s)
00:31:03

[filtering with the faster I library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m05s)
00:31:05

[without thinking too much but so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m09s)
00:31:09

[we're going to dig in and try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m12s)
00:31:12

[rebuild that we'll try and get to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m14s)
00:31:14

[point that we're getting something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m16s)
00:31:16

[around 0.7 seven point seven eight from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m17s)
00:31:17

[scratch but if you want to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m21s)
00:31:21

[yourself at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m25s)
00:31:25

[you know without worry about the detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m26s)
00:31:26

[that's you know those three lines of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m27s)
00:31:27

[code here's what you need okay so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m30s)
00:31:30

[get the predictions in the usual way and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m33s)
00:31:33

[you know we could for example plot SNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m35s)
00:31:35

[is Seabourn see one's a really great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m39s)
00:31:39

[flooding library it sits on top of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m40s)
00:31:40

[matplotlib it actually leverages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m42s)
00:31:42

[matplotlib so anything you learn about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m45s)
00:31:45

[matplotlib will help you with SIBO and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m47s)
00:31:47

[it's got a few like nice little plots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m48s)
00:31:48

[like this joint plot here is I'm doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m50s)
00:31:50

00:31:54

[these are my actual season my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h31m58s)
00:31:58

[predictions and you can kind of see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m00s)
00:32:00

[the shape here is that as we predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m02s)
00:32:02

[higher numbers they actually are higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m04s)
00:32:04

[numbers and you can also see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m06s)

[histogram of the predictions and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m07s)
00:32:07

[histogram of the ashes so that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m10s)

00:32:14

[please explain the n factors why it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m18s)
00:32:18

[set to 50 it's set to 50 because I tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m22s)
00:32:22

[a few things in the world it's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m25s)
00:32:25

[dimensionality of the embedding images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[or to think for it another way it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m31s)
00:32:31

[how you know rather than five it's fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m34s)
00:32:34

[Jeremy I have a question about suppose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m41s)
00:32:41

[that your recommendation system is more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m45s)
00:32:45

[implicit so you have zeros or ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m50s)
00:32:50

[instead of just actual numbers right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m52s)
00:32:52

[basically we would then need to use a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m56s)
00:32:56

[classifier instead of regresa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h32m59s)
00:32:59

[I have to sample the negative or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m01s)
00:33:01

[something like that so if you don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m05s)
00:33:05

[it which is up once let's say like just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m06s)
00:33:06

[kind of implicit feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m09s)
00:33:09

[oh I'm not sure we'll get to that one in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m11s)
00:33:11

[this class but what I will say is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[in the case that you just doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m15s)
00:33:15

[classification rather than regression we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m16s)
00:33:16

[haven't actually built that in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m20s)
00:33:20

[library yet maybe somebody this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m21s)
00:33:21

[that wants to try adding it it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m23s)
00:33:23

[only be a small number of lines of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m24s)
00:33:24

[you basically have to change the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m26s)
00:33:26

[activation function to be a sigmoid and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m28s)
00:33:28

[you would have to change the criterion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m30s)
00:33:30

[or the loss function to be cross-entropy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m34s)
00:33:34

[rather than rmse and that will give you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m37s)
00:33:37

[a classifier rather than a regresar how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m41s)
00:33:41

[those are the only things you'll have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m44s)
00:33:44

[change so hopefully somebody this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m45s)
00:33:45

[won't take up that challenge and by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m47s)
00:33:47

[time we come back next week we've all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m49s)
00:33:49

[have that working ok so I said that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m50s)
00:33:50

[we're basically doing a dot product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m57s)
00:33:57

[right or you know a dot product is kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h33m59s)
00:33:59

[of the vector version I guess of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m02s)
00:34:02

[matrix product so we're basically doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m04s)
00:34:04

[each of these things times each of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m07s)
00:34:07

[things and then add it together so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m10s)
00:34:10

[just have a look at how we do that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m14s)
00:34:14

[Python so we can create a tensor in pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m16s)
00:34:16

[torch just using this little capital T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m20s)
00:34:20

[thing you can just say that's the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m22s)
00:34:22

[day I version the full version is torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m25s)
00:34:25

[dot from I'm pie or something but I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m26s)
00:34:26

[got to set up so you can possibly pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m29s)
00:34:29

[in even a list of lists so this is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m31s)
00:34:31

[to create a torch tensor with one two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m34s)
00:34:34

[three four and then here's a torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m37s)
00:34:37

[tensor with two to ten ten ok so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m39s)
00:34:39

[are two more chances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m43s)
00:34:43

[I didn't say doc CUDA so they're not on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m45s)
00:34:45

[the GPU they're sitting on the CPU just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m48s)
00:34:48

[FYI we can multiply them together right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m51s)
00:34:51

[and so anytime you have a mathematical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m55s)
00:34:55

[operator between tensors in numpy or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h34m57s)
00:34:57

[pipe torch it will do element wise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m01s)
00:35:01

[assuming that they're the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m04s)
00:35:04

[dimensionality which they are they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m06s)
00:35:06

[both to about two okay and so here we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m07s)
00:35:07

[got 2 by 2 is 4 3 by 10 is 30 and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m11s)
00:35:11

[forth ok so there's a a times B so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m15s)
00:35:15

[you think about basically what we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m19s)
00:35:19

[to do here is we want to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m21s)
00:35:21

[ok so I've got 1 times 2 is 2 2 times 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m29s)
00:35:29

[is 4 2 plus 4 is 6 and so that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m35s)
00:35:35

[actually the dot product between 1 2 &amp; 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m40s)
00:35:40

[4 and then here we've got 3 by 10 is 34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[by 40 sorry 4 by 10 is 40 30 and 40 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m48s)
00:35:48

[70 so in other words a times B dot some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m51s)
00:35:51

[along the first dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m56s)
00:35:56

[so that's summing up the columns in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h35m58s)
00:35:58

[other words across a row okay this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m00s)
00:36:00

[here is doing the dot product of each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m03s)
00:36:03

[these rows with each of these rows so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m07s)
00:36:07

[makes sense and obviously we could do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m11s)
00:36:11

[that with you know some kind of matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m13s)
00:36:13

[multiplication approach but I'm trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m16s)
00:36:16

[to really do things with this little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m17s)
00:36:17

[special case stuff as possible ok so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m20s)
00:36:20

[that's what we're going to use for our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m24s)
00:36:24

[dot products from now on so basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m25s)
00:36:25

[all we need to do now is remember we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m28s)
00:36:28

[have the data we have is not in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[crosstab format so in excel we've got it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m34s)
00:36:34

[in this crosstab format but we've got it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m36s)
00:36:36

[here in this listed format here's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m39s)
00:36:39

[movie rating user movie revenue so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m42s)
00:36:42

[conceptually we want to be like looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m44s)
00:36:44

[up this user into our embedding matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m46s)
00:36:46

[to find their 50 factors looking up that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m49s)
00:36:49

[movie to find their 50 factors and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m51s)
00:36:51

[take the dot product of those two 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m53s)
00:36:53

[long vectors so let's do that to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h36m56s)
00:36:56

[we're going to build a layer our own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m05s)
00:37:05

[custom neural net layer that's not right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m08s)
00:37:08

[so the the the more generic vocabulary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m12s)
00:37:12

[we call this is we're going to build a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m15s)
00:37:15

[high torch module okay so a PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m17s)
00:37:17

[module is a very specific thing it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m21s)
00:37:21

[something that you can use as a layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m24s)
00:37:24

[and a neural net once you've created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[your own height watch module you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m27s)
00:37:27

[throw it into a mirror on it and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m29s)
00:37:29

[module works by assuming we've already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m32s)
00:37:32

[got once a cordon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m35s)
00:37:35

[model you can pass in some things in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m36s)
00:37:36

[parentheses and it will calculate it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m39s)
00:37:39

[right so assuming that we already have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m40s)
00:37:40

[modular product we can instantiate it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m43s)
00:37:43

[like so to create our product object and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m48s)
00:37:48

[we can basically now treat that like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m52s)
00:37:52

[function right but the thing is it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m54s)
00:37:54

[just a function because we'll be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h37m57s)
00:37:57

[do things like take derivatives of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m00s)
00:38:00

[stack them up together into a big stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m02s)
00:38:02

[of neural network layers blah blah blah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[so it's basically a function that we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m08s)
00:38:08

[kind of compose very conveniently so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m11s)
00:38:11

[here how do we define a module which as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m14s)
00:38:14

[you can see here returns a dot product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m18s)
00:38:18

[well we have to create a Python class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[and so if you haven't done - oo before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m23s)
00:38:23

[you're going to have to learn because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[all my torch modules are written in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m28s)
00:38:28

[Python oo and that's one of the things I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m31s)
00:38:31

[really like about PI torch is that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m33s)
00:38:33

[doesn't reinvent totally new ways of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m35s)
00:38:35

[doing things by tensorflow does all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m38s)

[time in pi torch that you know really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m40s)
00:38:40

[tend to use pythonic ways to do things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m43s)
00:38:43

[so in this case how do you create you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m46s)
00:38:46

[know some kind of new behavior you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m48s)
00:38:48

[create a Python plus it's so Jeremy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m51s)
00:38:51

[suppose that you have a lot of data not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m55s)
00:38:55

[just a little bit of data you can have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h38m59s)
00:38:59

[in memory will you be able to use fossae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m01s)
00:39:01

[I to solve glory filtering yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m03s)
00:39:03

[absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m07s)
00:39:07

[it's it uses mini-batch stochastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m08s)
00:39:08

[gradient descent which does have a batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m15s)
00:39:15

[at a time the this particular version is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m16s)
00:39:16

[going to create a panda's data frame and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m26s)
00:39:26

[panda's data frame has to live in memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m30s)
00:39:30

[having said that you can get easily 512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m33s)
00:39:33

[gig you know instances on Amazon so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m37s)
00:39:37

[if you had a CSV that was bigger than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m40s)
00:39:40

[512 gig you know that would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m42s)
00:39:42

[impressive if that did happen I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m46s)
00:39:46

[you would have to instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m48s)
00:39:48

[save that as a be calls array and create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m50s)
00:39:50

[a slightly different version that reads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m52s)
00:39:52

[from a because array just streaming in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m54s)
00:39:54

[or maybe from a desk data frame which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h39m56s)
00:39:56

[also so it would be easy to do I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m00s)
00:40:00

[think I've seen real-world situations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m03s)
00:40:03

[where you have 512 gigabyte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m06s)
00:40:06

[collaborative filtering matrices but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m09s)
00:40:09

[yeah we can do it okay now this is PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m11s)
00:40:11

[torch specific this next bit is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m18s)
00:40:18

[when you define like the actual work to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m20s)
00:40:20

[be done which is here return user times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m23s)
00:40:23

[movie dot some you have to put it in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m26s)
00:40:26

[special method called forward okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[this is this idea that like it's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m32s)
00:40:32

[likely you're on that right in a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m34s)
00:40:34

[net the thing where you calculate the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m37s)
00:40:37

[next set of activations is called the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m39s)
00:40:39

[the forward pass and so that's doing a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m43s)
00:40:43

[forward calculation the gradients is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m45s)
00:40:45

[called the backward calculation we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m48s)
00:40:48

[have to do that because PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m50s)
00:40:50

[calculates that automatically so we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m51s)
00:40:51

[have to define forward so we create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m53s)
00:40:53

[new class we define forward and here we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m56s)
00:40:56

[write in our definition of dot product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h40m59s)
00:40:59

[ok so that's it so now that we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m01s)
00:41:01

[created this class definition we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m05s)
00:41:05

[instantiate our model right and we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m08s)
00:41:08

[call our model and get back the numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m11s)
00:41:11

[be expected okay so that's it that's how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m13s)
00:41:13

[we create a custom PI torch layer and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m16s)
00:41:16

[you compare that to like any other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m20s)
00:41:20

[library around pretty much this is way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m23s)
00:41:23

[easier basically I guess because we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m25s)
00:41:25

[leveraging what's already in person so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m28s)
00:41:28

[let's go ahead and now create a more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m32s)
00:41:32

[complex module and we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m34s)
00:41:34

[basically do the same thing we've got to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m38s)
00:41:38

[have a forward again we're going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m40s)
00:41:40

[our users x movies dot sum but we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m43s)
00:41:43

[going to do one more thing before hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m46s)
00:41:46

[which is we're going to create two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m47s)
00:41:47

[embedding matrices and then we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m49s)
00:41:49

[to look up our users and our movies in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[those inventing matrices so let's go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m54s)
00:41:54

[through and and do that so the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h41m57s)
00:41:57

[thing to realize is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m01s)
00:42:01

[that the uses the user IDs and the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m03s)
00:42:03

[IDs may not be contiguous you know like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m07s)
00:42:07

[they're maybe they start at a million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m11s)
00:42:11

[and go to a million in 1000 so right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m12s)
00:42:12

[if we just used those IDs directly to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[look up into an embedding matrix we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m21s)
00:42:21

[would have to create an embedding matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m23s)
00:42:23

[of size 1 million 1000 right which we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m24s)
00:42:24

[don't want to do so the first thing I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m27s)
00:42:27

[is to get a list of the unique user IDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[and then I create a mapping from every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[user ID to a contiguous integer this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m37s)
00:42:37

[thing I've done here where I've created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m42s)
00:42:42

[a dictionary which maps from every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m44s)
00:42:44

[unique thing to a unique index is well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m48s)
00:42:48

[worth studying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m51s)
00:42:51

[during the week because like it's is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m52s)
00:42:52

[super super handy it's something you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m54s)
00:42:54

[very very often have to do in all kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m56s)
00:42:56

[of machine learning all right and so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h42m58s)
00:42:58

[won't go through it here it's easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m00s)
00:43:00

[enough to figure out if you can't figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[it out just ask on the forum anyway so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m03s)
00:43:03

[once we've got the mapping from user to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m06s)
00:43:06

[a contiguous index we then can say let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[now replace the user ID column with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m14s)
00:43:14

[contiguous index right so pandas dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m18s)
00:43:18

[apply applies an arbitrary function and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[python lambda is how you create an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m25s)
00:43:25

[anonymous function on the fly and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m27s)
00:43:27

[anonymous function simply returns the NS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m29s)
00:43:29

[through the same thing for movies and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m32s)
00:43:32

[after that we now have the same ratings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m36s)
00:43:36

[table we had before but our IDs have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m38s)
00:43:38

[been mapped to contiguous integers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m41s)
00:43:41

[therefore they're things that we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m43s)
00:43:43

[look up into an embedding matrix so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[let's get the count of our users in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m49s)
00:43:49

[movies and let's now go ahead and try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m51s)
00:43:51

[and create our Python version of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m54s)
00:43:54

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h43m59s)
00:43:59

[so earlier on when we created our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m00s)
00:44:00

[simplest possible PI torch module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[there was no like state we didn't need a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[constructor because we weren't like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m14s)
00:44:14

[saying how many users are there or how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m16s)
00:44:16

[many movies are there or how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m18s)
00:44:18

[factors do we want or whatever right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m19s)
00:44:19

[anytime we want to do something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m21s)
00:44:21

[this where we're passing in and saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m25s)
00:44:25

[we want to construct our module with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m28s)
00:44:28

[this number of users and this number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m32s)
00:44:32

[movies then we need a constructor for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m34s)
00:44:34

[our class and you create a constructor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m37s)
00:44:37

[in Python by defining a dunder init](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m40s)
00:44:40

[underscore underscore init underscore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m44s)
00:44:44

[underscore yet special name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m45s)
00:44:45

[so this just creates a constructor and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m47s)
00:44:47

[if you haven't done over before you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m50s)
00:44:50

[wanted to do some study during the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m53s)
00:44:53

[but it's pretty simple idea this is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m54s)
00:44:54

[the thing that when we create this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[object this is what gets wrong okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h44m59s)
00:44:59

[again special python thing when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m01s)
00:45:01

[create your own constructor you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m04s)
00:45:04

[call the parent class constructor and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m07s)
00:45:07

[you want to have all of the cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m09s)
00:45:09

[behavior of a PI porch module you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m11s)
00:45:11

[that by inheriting from an end module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m13s)
00:45:13

[neural net module okay so basically by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m17s)
00:45:17

[inheriting here and calling the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m20s)
00:45:20

[superclass constructor we now have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m22s)
00:45:22

[fully functioning PI torch layer okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m25s)
00:45:25

[now we have to give it some behavior and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m28s)
00:45:28

[so we give us some behavior by storing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m30s)
00:45:30

[some things in it all right so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m32s)
00:45:32

[we're going to create something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m35s)
00:45:35

[self dot you users and that is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m38s)
00:45:38

[be an embedding layer a number of rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m41s)
00:45:41

[is an user's number of columns is in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m45s)
00:45:45

[factors so that is exactly this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m47s)
00:45:47

[the number of rows is M users number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m51s)
00:45:51

[columns is inventors and then we'll have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m55s)
00:45:55

[to do the same thing for movies okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h45m58s)
00:45:58

[that's going to go ahead and create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m01s)
00:46:01

[these two randomly initialized arrays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m04s)
00:46:04

[however when you randomly initialize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m09s)
00:46:09

[over an array it's important to randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m12s)
00:46:12

[initialize it to a reasonable set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m14s)
00:46:14

[numbers like a reasonable scale right if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[we randomly initialize them from like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m20s)
00:46:20

[naught to a million then we would start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m22s)
00:46:22

[out and you know these things would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m24s)
00:46:24

[start out being like you know billions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m26s)
00:46:26

[and billions of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m29s)
00:46:29

[writing and that's going to be very hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[to do gradient descent on so I just kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m32s)
00:46:32

[of manually figured here like okay about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m35s)
00:46:35

[what size numbers are going to give me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m38s)
00:46:38

[about the right readiness and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m41s)
00:46:41

[don't we know we did ratings between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m43s)
00:46:43

[about normal five so if we start out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m44s)
00:46:44

[with stuff between about naught and 0.05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m48s)
00:46:48

[then we're going to get ratings of about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m51s)
00:46:51

[the right level you can easily enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m52s)
00:46:52

[like that calculate that in in neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m56s)
00:46:56

[nets there are standard algorithms for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h46m58s)
00:46:58

[basically doing doing that calculation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m02s)
00:47:02

[and the basic the key algorithm is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m05s)
00:47:05

[something called initialization from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m08s)
00:47:08

[climbing her and the basic idea is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m12s)
00:47:12

[you take the yeah you basically set the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m19s)
00:47:19

[weights equal to a normal distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m25s)
00:47:25

[with a standard deviation which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m32s)
00:47:32

[basically inversely proportional to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m35s)
00:47:35

[number of things in the previous layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m37s)
00:47:37

[and so in our previous layer so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m40s)
00:47:40

[case we basically if you basically take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m48s)
00:47:48

[that nor to 0.05 and multiply it by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m51s)
00:47:51

[fact that you've got 40 things with a 40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m54s)
00:47:54

[or 50 things coming out of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h47m58s)
00:47:58

[50 50 things coming out of it and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m00s)
00:48:00

[you're going to get something about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m03s)
00:48:03

[right size pi torch has already has like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m04s)
00:48:04

[her initialization class they're like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m09s)
00:48:09

[don't in normally in real life have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m13s)
00:48:13

[think about this we can just call the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m15s)
00:48:15

[existing initialization functions but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m16s)
00:48:16

[we're trying to do this all like from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m19s)
00:48:19

[scratch here okay without any special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m21s)
00:48:21

[stuff going on so there's quite a bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m24s)
00:48:24

[pi torch notation here so self dot u](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m28s)
00:48:28

[we've already set to an instance of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m31s)
00:48:31

[embedding class it has a dot weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m34s)
00:48:34

[attribute which contains the actual the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m39s)
00:48:39

[actual embed images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m42s)
00:48:42

[so that contains this the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m44s)
00:48:44

[embedding matrix is not a tensor it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m49s)
00:48:49

[variable a variable is exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m53s)
00:48:53

[as a tensor in other words it supports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m57s)
00:48:57

[the exact same operations as a tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h48m59s)
00:48:59

[but it also does automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m02s)
00:49:02

[differentiation that's all a variable is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m05s)
00:49:05

[basically to pull the tensor out of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m08s)
00:49:08

[variable you get its data attribute okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m13s)
00:49:13

[so this is so this is now the tensor of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m16s)
00:49:16

[the weight matrix of the self dot you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m19s)
00:49:19

[inventing and then something that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m22s)
00:49:22

[really handy to know is that all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m25s)
00:49:25

[tensor functions in pi torch you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m27s)
00:49:27

[stick an underscore at the end and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m31s)
00:49:31

[means do it in place all right so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m32s)
00:49:32

[is say create a random uniform random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m35s)
00:49:35

[number of an appropriate size for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m38s)
00:49:38

[tensor and don't return it but actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m41s)
00:49:41

[fill in that matrix unless okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m45s)
00:49:45

[that's a super handy thing to know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m49s)
00:49:49

[I mean it wouldn't be rocket science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m51s)
00:49:51

[otherwise we would have to have gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h49m59s)
00:49:59

[okay here's the non in-place version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m02s)
00:50:02

[that's what saves us some typing saves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m05s)
00:50:05

[us some screen noise that's all okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m07s)
00:50:07

[now we've got our randomly initialized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m15s)
00:50:15

[embedding weight matrices and so now the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m18s)
00:50:18

[forward I'm actually going to use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[same columnar model data that we used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m24s)
00:50:24

[for Russman and so it's actually going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m27s)
00:50:27

[to be passed both categorical variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m31s)
00:50:31

[and continuous variables and in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[case there are no continuous variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m35s)
00:50:35

[so I'm just going to grab the 0th column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m38s)
00:50:38

[out of the categorical variables and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m41s)
00:50:41

[call it users and the first column and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m43s)
00:50:43

[call it movies okay so I'm just kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m45s)
00:50:45

[too lazy to create my own I've lots to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[do about too lazy out that we do have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m50s)
00:50:50

[special class with this but I'm trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[to avoid creating a special class so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m53s)
00:50:53

[just going to leverage this columnar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m55s)
00:50:55

[model data plus okay so we can basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h50m57s)
00:50:57

[grab our user and movies mini-batches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m01s)
00:51:01

[right and remember this is not a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m04s)
00:51:04

[user in a single movie this is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m07s)
00:51:07

[be a whole mini batch of them we can now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[look up that mini batch of users in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[embedding matrix U and the movies in are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m15s)
00:51:15

[embedding matrix okay so this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m18s)
00:51:18

[exactly the same is just doing an array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m21s)
00:51:21

[lookup to grab the user ID numbered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m23s)
00:51:23

[value but we're doing that a whole mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m27s)
00:51:27

[batch at a time right and so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m29s)
00:51:29

[because PI torch can do a whole mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m31s)
00:51:31

[batch at a time with pretty much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m33s)
00:51:33

[everything that we can get really easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m34s)
00:51:34

[speed up we don't have to write any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m36s)
00:51:36

[loops on the whole to do everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m39s)
00:51:39

[through our mini batch and in fact if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m41s)
00:51:41

[you do ever loop through your mini batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m43s)
00:51:43

[manually you don't get GPU acceleration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m45s)
00:51:45

[that's really important to know right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m48s)
00:51:48

[you never want to loop have a for loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m50s)
00:51:50

[going through your mini batch you always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m52s)
00:51:52

[want to do things in this kind of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m54s)
00:51:54

[whole mini batch at a time but pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m56s)
00:51:56

[much everything imply torch does things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h51m59s)
00:51:59

[are holding events at a time so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m01s)
00:52:01

[shouldn't have to worry about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m03s)
00:52:03

[and then here's our product just like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m05s)
00:52:05

[before right so having to find that I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m08s)
00:52:08

[now going to go ahead and say alright my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m14s)
00:52:14

[X values is everything except the rating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m18s)
00:52:18

[and the timestamp in my writings table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m22s)
00:52:22

[my Y is my rating and then I can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m24s)
00:52:24

[say okay let's grab a model data from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m27s)
00:52:27

[data frame using that X and that Y and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m30s)
00:52:30

[here is our list of categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m33s)
00:52:33

[variables okay and then so let's now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m36s)
00:52:36

[instantiate that PI torch object alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m43s)
00:52:43

[so we've now created that from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m47s)
00:52:47

[and then the next thing we need to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m49s)
00:52:49

[to create an optimizer so this is part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m52s)
00:52:52

[of pi torch the only fast AI thing here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h52m55s)
00:52:55

[is this line right because that's like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m00s)
00:53:00

[don't think showing you how to build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m02s)
00:53:02

[data sets and data load is interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m05s)
00:53:05

[enough really we might do that in part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m07s)
00:53:07

[two of the course and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m09s)
00:53:09

[it's actually so straightforward like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[lot of you are already doing it on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m12s)
00:53:12

[forums so I'm not going to show you that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[in this part but if you're interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m17s)
00:53:17

[feel free to talk on the forums about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m19s)
00:53:19

[but I'm just going to basically take the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m21s)
00:53:21

[thing that feeds us data is a given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m24s)
00:53:24

[particularly cuz these things are so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m26s)
00:53:26

[flexible right you know if you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m27s)
00:53:27

[stuff enough data frame you can just use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m29s)
00:53:29

[this you don't have to rewrite it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m31s)
00:53:31

[that's the only fast AI thing we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m34s)
00:53:34

[using so this is a PI torch thing and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m35s)
00:53:35

[optiom is the thing and pi torch that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m39s)
00:53:39

[gives us an optimizer will be learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m42s)
00:53:42

[about that very shortly so it's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m44s)
00:53:44

[the thing that's going to update our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m48s)
00:53:48

[weights pi torch calls them the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m49s)
00:53:49

[parameters of the model so earlier on we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m54s)
00:53:54

[set model equals embedding dot blah blah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h53m58s)
00:53:58

[right and because embedding dot derives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m01s)
00:54:01

[from NN module we get all of the pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m04s)
00:54:04

[torch module behavior and one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m07s)
00:54:07

[things we got for free is the ability to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m10s)
00:54:10

[say got parameters so that's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m12s)
00:54:12

[that's pretty any right that's the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m16s)
00:54:16

[that basically is going to automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m19s)
00:54:19

[give us a list of all of the weights in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m21s)
00:54:21

[our model that have to be updated and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m24s)
00:54:24

[that's what gets passed to the optimizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m27s)
00:54:27

[we also passed the optimized at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m29s)
00:54:29

[learning rate the weight decay which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m31s)
00:54:31

[we'll talk about later and momentum that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m34s)
00:54:34

[we'll talk about later okay one other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m37s)
00:54:37

[thing that I'm not going to do right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m42s)
00:54:42

[but we will do later is to write a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m43s)
00:54:43

[training loop so the training loop is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m45s)
00:54:45

[thing that lives for each mini batch and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m48s)
00:54:48

[updates the weight to subtract the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m51s)
00:54:51

[gradient times the moment there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m54s)
00:54:54

[function in fast AI which is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h54m58s)
00:54:58

[training loop and it's it's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m01s)
00:55:01

[simple here it is right for a POC in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m07s)
00:55:07

[epochs this is just the thing that shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m12s)
00:55:12

[a progress bar so ignore this for X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m16s)
00:55:16

[comma Y in my training data loader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m18s)
00:55:18

[calculate the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m21s)
00:55:21

[print out the lots you know in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m25s)
00:55:25

[progress bar call any callbacks you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m28s)
00:55:28

[and at the end call the call the metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m32s)
00:55:32

[on the validation alright so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m37s)
00:55:37

[there's just eh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m39s)
00:55:39

[Apoc go through each mini batch and do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m41s)
00:55:41

[one step of optimizer step is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m46s)
00:55:46

[going to take advantage of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m50s)
00:55:50

[optimizer but we'll be writing that from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[scratch shortly so this is notice we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m54s)
00:55:54

[not using a learner okay we're just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h55m58s)
00:55:58

[using a hi book module so this this fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m00s)
00:56:00

[thing although it's passed to a part of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m04s)
00:56:04

[fast AI it's like lower down the layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m05s)
00:56:05

[of abstraction now this is the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m09s)
00:56:09

[that takes a regular high torch model so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m10s)
00:56:10

[if you ever want to like skip as much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m14s)
00:56:14

[faster eye stuff as possible like you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m19s)
00:56:19

[got some high torch model you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m21s)
00:56:21

[some code on the internet you basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m23s)
00:56:23

[want to run it that you don't want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m24s)
00:56:24

[write your own training loop then this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m27s)
00:56:27

[is this is what you want to do you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m29s)
00:56:29

[to call fast a high speed version and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m30s)
00:56:30

[what you'll find is like the library is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m33s)
00:56:33

[designed so that you can kind of dig in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m35s)
00:56:35

[at any layer abstraction you like right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m37s)
00:56:37

[and so at this layer of abstraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m41s)
00:56:41

[you're not going to get things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m43s)
00:56:43

[stochastic gradient descent with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m46s)
00:56:46

[restarts you're not going to get like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m47s)
00:56:47

[differential learning rates like all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m49s)
00:56:49

[that stuff that's in the learner like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m51s)
00:56:51

[you could do it but you'd have to write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m53s)
00:56:53

[it all about by hand yourself alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m55s)
00:56:55

[and that's the downside of kind of going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m57s)
00:56:57

[down to this level of abstraction the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h56m59s)
00:56:59

[upside is that as you saw the code for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m02s)
00:57:02

[this is very simple it's just a simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m04s)
00:57:04

[training loop it takes a standard 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m06s)
00:57:06

[torch model so this is like this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m08s)
00:57:08

[good thing for us to use here we can we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m11s)
00:57:11

[just call it and it looks exactly like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m13s)
00:57:13

[what we used to see all right we got our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m15s)
00:57:15

[validation and training loss for the 3 e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m19s)
00:57:19

[bus now you'll notice that we wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m22s)
00:57:22

[something around 0.76 so we're not there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m29s)
00:57:29

[so in other words the the the default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m34s)
00:57:34

[fast AI collaborative dory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m37s)
00:57:37

[rhythm is doing something smarter than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m38s)
00:57:38

[this so we're going to try and do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m41s)
00:57:41

[one thing that we can do since we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m44s)
00:57:44

[calling our you know this lower level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m46s)
00:57:46

[fifth function there's no learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[and kneeling we could do our own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m50s)
00:57:50

[learning rate annealing so you can hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[it see here there's a first day I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m54s)
00:57:54

[function called set learning rates you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m55s)
00:57:55

[can pass in a standard height watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m57s)
00:57:57

[optimizer and pass in your new learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h57m59s)
00:57:59

[rate and then call fit again and so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m02s)
00:58:02

[is how we can let manually do a learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m05s)
00:58:05

[rate schedule and so you can see we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m08s)
00:58:08

[got a little bit better 1.13 where you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m10s)
00:58:10

[still got a long way to go okay so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m13s)
00:58:13

[think what we might do is we might have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m18s)
00:58:18

[a seven minute break and then we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m20s)
00:58:20

[going to come back and try and improve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m24s)
00:58:24

[this core of it for those who are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m27s)
00:58:27

[interested somebody was asking me the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m38s)
00:58:38

[break for a kind of a quick walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m39s)
00:58:39

[so this is totally optional but if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m42s)
00:58:42

[go into the first day I library there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m45s)
00:58:45

[a model py file and that's where fit is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m47s)
00:58:47

[which we're just looking at which goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m54s)
00:58:54

[through each epoch in epochs and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h58m57s)
00:58:57

[goes through each x and y in the mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m01s)
00:59:01

[batch and then it calls this step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m03s)
00:59:03

[function so the step function is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m07s)
00:59:07

[and you can see the key thing is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m15s)
00:59:15

[calculates the output from the model the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m17s)
00:59:17

[models for M right and so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[remember our dot product we didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m20s)
00:59:20

[actually call model dot forward we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m26s)
00:59:26

[called model parentheses and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[because the N n dot module automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m30s)
00:59:30

[you know when you call it as if it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[function it passes it along to forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m37s)
00:59:37

[okay so that's that's what that's doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m39s)
00:59:39

[there right and then the rest of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m42s)
00:59:42

[world will learn about shortly which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m44s)
00:59:44

[basically doing the the loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m45s)
00:59:45

[and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m49s)
00:59:49

[the backward pass okay so for those who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m50s)
00:59:50

[are interested that's that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m53s)
00:59:53

[gets you a bit of a sense of how the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m55s)
00:59:55

[cone it's structured if you want to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m57s)
00:59:57

[at it and as I say like the the faster I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=00h59m59s)
00:59:59

[code is designed to both be world-class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m02s)
01:00:02

[performance but also pretty easy to read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m06s)
01:00:06

[so like feel free like take a look at it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m09s)
01:00:09

[and if you want to know what's going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m13s)
01:00:13

[just ask on the forums and if you you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m15s)
01:00:15

[know if you think is anything that could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m18s)
01:00:18

[be clearer let us know because yeah the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m19s)
01:00:19

[code is definitely now we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m25s)
01:00:25

[digging into the code or in law okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[let's try and improve this a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m31s)
01:00:31

[and let's start off by improving it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m33s)
01:00:33

[Excel so you might have noticed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m36s)
01:00:36

[that we've kind of got the idea that use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m40s)
01:00:40

[a 72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m43s)
01:00:43

[you know like sci-fi modern movies with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m44s)
01:00:44

[special effects you know whatever and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m48s)
01:00:48

[movie number 27 is sci-fi and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m50s)
01:00:50

[special effects so much dialogue but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m53s)
01:00:53

[we're missing an important case which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h00m57s)
01:00:57

[like user 72 is pretty enthusiastic on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m00s)
01:01:00

[the hall and on average rates things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m05s)
01:01:05

[higher and Highland you know and movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m07s)
01:01:07

[27 you know it's just a popular movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m10s)
01:01:10

[you know it's just on average its higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m14s)
01:01:14

[so what would really like is to add a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m17s)
01:01:17

[constant for the user and a constant for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m20s)
01:01:20

[the movie and remember in neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m24s)
01:01:24

[terms we call that a bias that's what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m26s)
01:01:26

[want to add a bias so we could easily do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m29s)
01:01:29

[that and if we go into the bias tab here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m32s)
01:01:32

[we've got the same data as before and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m35s)
01:01:35

[we've got the same latent factors as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m37s)
01:01:37

[before and I've just got one extra row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m41s)
01:01:41

[here and one extra column here and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m44s)
01:01:44

[won't be surprised here that we now take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m48s)
01:01:48

[these same matrix multiplication as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m51s)
01:01:51

[before and we add in that and we add in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m53s)
01:01:53

[that okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h01m58s)
01:01:58

[bias so other than that we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m01s)
01:02:01

[exactly the same loss function over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m05s)
01:02:05

[and so just like before we can now go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m07s)
01:02:07

[ahead and solve that and now our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m11s)
01:02:11

[changing variables include the bias and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m14s)
01:02:14

[we can say solve and if we leave that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m18s)
01:02:18

[for a little while it will come to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m20s)
01:02:20

[better result than we had before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m23s)
01:02:23

[okay so that's the first thing we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m27s)
01:02:27

[going to do to improve our model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m30s)
01:02:30

[there's really very little show just to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m32s)
01:02:32

[make the code a bit shorter I have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m37s)
01:02:37

[find a function called get embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m41s)
01:02:41

[which takes a number of inputs and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m43s)
01:02:43

[number of factors so the number of rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m46s)
01:02:46

[and the embedding matrix Nomos they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m48s)
01:02:48

[both medications creates the embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m50s)
01:02:50

[and then randomly initializes it I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m52s)
01:02:52

[know why I'm doing negative to positive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[here and it zeroed last time honestly it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h02m59s)
01:02:59

[doesn't matter much as long as it's in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m00s)
01:03:00

[the right ballpark and then we return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[that initialized emitting so now we need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m05s)
01:03:05

[not just our users by factors which are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[Chuck into you our movies by factors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m11s)
01:03:11

[which I've shocked into M but we also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m14s)
01:03:14

[need users by one which will put into UV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m16s)
01:03:16

[user bias and movies by one which will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[put into the movie bias okay so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m23s)
01:03:23

[just doing a list comprehension going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m25s)
01:03:25

[through each of the tuples create an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m28s)
01:03:28

[embedding for each of them and putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m29s)
01:03:29

[them into these things okay so now our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m31s)
01:03:31

[forward is exactly the same as before u](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m34s)
01:03:34

[times M sub I mean this is actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m40s)
01:03:40

[little confusing because we're doing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m44s)
01:03:44

[into two steps maybe they make it a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[easier let's pull this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m50s)
01:03:50

[put it up here put this in parentheses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m51s)
01:03:51

[okay so maybe that looks a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h03m58s)
01:03:58

[more familiar all right you times n dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m00s)
01:04:00

[some that's the same dot product and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m02s)
01:04:02

[then here it is going to add in our user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m04s)
01:04:04

[pious and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m07s)
01:04:07

[our movie bus dot squeeze is the PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m08s)
01:04:08

[torch thing that adds an additional unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m14s)
01:04:14

[axis that's not going to make any sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m17s)
01:04:17

[if you haven't done broadcasting before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m21s)
01:04:21

[I'm not going to do a broadcasting in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m23s)
01:04:23

[this course because we've already done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m25s)
01:04:25

[it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m27s)
01:04:27

[and we're doing it in the machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[learning course but basically in in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m29s)
01:04:29

[short broadcasting is what happens when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[you do something like this where um is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m34s)
01:04:34

[matrix you be self-taught you the users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m36s)
01:04:36

[is a is a vector how do you add a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m40s)
01:04:40

[to a matrix and basically what it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m44s)
01:04:44

[is it duplicates the vector so that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m46s)
01:04:46

[makes it the same size as the matrix and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m51s)
01:04:51

[the particular way whether it duplicates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m53s)
01:04:53

[it across columns or down rows or how it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m55s)
01:04:55

[does it is called broadcasting the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h04m58s)
01:04:58

[broadcasting rules are the same as numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m00s)
01:05:00

[Pytor didn't actually used to support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m03s)
01:05:03

[broadcasting so I was actually the guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m05s)
01:05:05

[who first added broadcasting to PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m07s)
01:05:07

[using an ugly hack and then the pipe or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m09s)
01:05:09

[authors did an awesome job of supporting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m11s)
01:05:11

[it actually inside the language so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m13s)
01:05:13

[you can use the same broadcasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m17s)
01:05:17

[operations in five torches non-player if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m19s)
01:05:19

[you haven't dealt with this before it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m22s)
01:05:22

[really important to learn it because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m24s)
01:05:24

[like it's it's kind of the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m27s)
01:05:27

[important fundamental way to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m29s)
01:05:29

[computations quickly in the high-end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m31s)
01:05:31

[paid warship it's the thing that lets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m34s)
01:05:34

[you not have to do loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m35s)
01:05:35

[how could you imagine here if I had to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m37s)
01:05:37

[look through every row of this matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m38s)
01:05:38

[and add each did you know this vector to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m40s)
01:05:40

[every row it would be slow the you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m43s)
01:05:43

[a lot more code and the idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m46s)
01:05:46

[broadcasting it actually goes all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m50s)
01:05:50

[way back to APL which was a language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m52s)
01:05:52

[designed in the 50s by an extraordinary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m54s)

[originally designed or written out as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h05m59s)
01:05:59

[new type of mathematical notation he has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m02s)
01:06:02

[this great essay called notation as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m05s)
01:06:05

[tool for thought and the idea was that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m08s)
01:06:08

[like really good notation could actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m10s)
01:06:10

[make you think of better things and part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m12s)
01:06:12

[of that notation is this idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m15s)
01:06:15

[broadcasting I'm incredibly enthusiastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m17s)
01:06:17

[about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m20s)
01:06:20

[and we're gonna use it plenty so either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m21s)
01:06:21

[watch the machine learning lesson or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m25s)
01:06:25

[know google numpy broadcasting for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m30s)
01:06:30

[information anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m33s)
01:06:33

[so basically it works reasonably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m36s)
01:06:36

[intuitively we can add on we can add the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[vectors to the matrix all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m40s)
01:06:40

[having done that we're now going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[one more trick which is I think it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m49s)
01:06:49

[your net asked earlier about could we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m53s)
01:06:53

[squish the ratings to be between one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m56s)
01:06:56

[five and the answer is we could right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h06m59s)
01:06:59

[and specifically what we could do is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m05s)
01:07:05

[could put it through a sigmoid function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m12s)
01:07:12

[so remind you a sigmoid function looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m14s)
01:07:14

[like that right and this is that's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m19s)
01:07:19

[okay we could put it through a secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m24s)
01:07:24

[function so we could take like four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m27s)
01:07:27

[point nine six and put it through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m29s)
01:07:29

[sigmoid function and like that you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m31s)
01:07:31

[that's kind of high so it kind of be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m33s)
01:07:33

[over here somewhere right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m35s)
01:07:35

[and then we could multiply that sigmoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m37s)
01:07:37

[like the result of that by five for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[example all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m44s)
01:07:44

[and in this case we want it to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m46s)
01:07:46

[between one and five right so maybe we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m47s)
01:07:47

[would multiply it by four and add one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[instance that's the basic idea and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m51s)
01:07:51

[here is that trick we take the result so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h07m56s)
01:07:56

[the result is basically the the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m00s)
01:08:00

[that comes straight out of the dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m01s)
01:08:01

[product plus the addition of the biases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m03s)
01:08:03

[and put it through a sigmoid function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m05s)
01:08:05

[now in pi torch basically all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m08s)
01:08:08

[functions you can do to tensors are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m13s)
01:08:13

[available inside this thing called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m16s)
01:08:16

[capital F and this is like totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m19s)
01:08:19

[standard in pi torch it's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m21s)
01:08:21

[called torch and or functional but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m23s)
01:08:23

[everybody including all of the pipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[torch Doc's import torch start and end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m28s)
01:08:28

[are functional as capital F all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m30s)
01:08:30

[capital F dot sigmoid means a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m33s)
01:08:33

[called sigmoid that is coming from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m36s)
01:08:36

[tortures functional module right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m38s)
01:08:38

[that's going to apply a sigmoid function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m42s)
01:08:42

[for the result so I squish them all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m44s)
01:08:44

[between zero and one using that nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m46s)
01:08:46

[little shape and then I can multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m48s)
01:08:48

[that by five minus one plus four right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m50s)
01:08:50

[and then add on one and that's gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m54s)
01:08:54

[give me plumbing between one and five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m57s)
01:08:57

[okay so like there's no need to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h08m58s)
01:08:58

[I could comment it out and it'll still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m03s)
01:09:03

[work right but now it has to come up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m04s)
01:09:04

[with a set of calculations that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m08s)
01:09:08

[always between one and five right where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m09s)
01:09:09

[else if I leave this in then it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m13s)
01:09:13

[makes it really easy it's basically like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m15s)
01:09:15

[oh if you think this is a really good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m16s)
01:09:16

[movie just calculate a really high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m17s)
01:09:17

[number it's a really crappy movies low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m20s)
01:09:20

[number and I'll make sure it's in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m22s)
01:09:22

[right regions so even though this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m24s)
01:09:24

[neural network it's still a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m26s)
01:09:26

[of this kind of like if you're doing any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m28s)
01:09:28

[kind of parameter fitting try and make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m30s)
01:09:30

[it so that the thing that you want your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m33s)
01:09:33

[function to return it's like it's easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m35s)
01:09:35

[for it to return that okay so that's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m37s)
01:09:37

[we do that that function squishing so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m40s)
01:09:40

[call this embedding dot bias so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m44s)
01:09:44

[create that in the same way as before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m48s)
01:09:48

[you'll see here I'm calling dr. to put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[it on the GPU because we're not using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m53s)
01:09:53

[any learner stuff normally it'll all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m54s)
01:09:54

[happen for you but we have to manually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m56s)
01:09:56

[say put it on the GPU this is the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h09m58s)
01:09:58

[as before create our optimizer fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m01s)
01:10:01

[exactly the same as before and these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m03s)
01:10:03

[numbers are looking good all right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m05s)
01:10:05

[again we'll do a little change to our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m08s)
01:10:08

[learning rate learning rate schedule and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m11s)
01:10:11

[we're down to 0.8 so we're actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m13s)
01:10:13

[pretty close pretty close so that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m16s)
01:10:16

[key steps and this is how this is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m23s)
01:10:23

[most collaborative filtering is done and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m31s)
01:10:31

[unit reminded me of an important point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m35s)
01:10:35

[which is that this is not strictly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m38s)
01:10:38

[speaking a matrix factorization because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m42s)
01:10:42

[strictly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m46s)
01:10:46

[a matrix factorization would take that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m46s)
01:10:46

[matrix by that matrix to create this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m49s)
01:10:49

[matrix and remembering anywhere that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h10m54s)
01:10:54

[this is empty like here or here we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m03s)
01:11:03

[putting in a zero right we're saying if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m08s)
01:11:08

[the original was empty put in a zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m11s)
01:11:11

[right now normally you can't do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[with normal matrix factorization normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m18s)
01:11:18

[matrix factorization it creates the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m20s)
01:11:20

[whole matrix and so it was a real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m22s)
01:11:22

[problem actually when people used to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m25s)
01:11:25

[and use traditional linear algebra for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m27s)
01:11:27

[this because when you have these sparse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m29s)
01:11:29

[matrices like in practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m31s)
01:11:31

[this matrix is not doesn't have many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m33s)
01:11:33

[gaps because we picked the users that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m36s)
01:11:36

[watch the most movies and the movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m38s)
01:11:38

[that are the most watched but if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m40s)
01:11:40

[look at the whole matrix it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[mainly empty and so traditional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m43s)
01:11:43

[techniques treated empty is zero and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m46s)
01:11:46

[like you basically have to predict a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m49s)
01:11:49

[zero as if the fact that I haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m51s)
01:11:51

[watched a movie means I don't like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m54s)
01:11:54

[movie that's gives terrible answers so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m55s)
01:11:55

[this probabilistic matrix factorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h11m58s)
01:11:58

[approach takes advantage of the fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m01s)
01:12:01

[that our data structure actually looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[like this rather than that cross tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m08s)
01:12:08

[right and so it's only calculating the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m11s)
01:12:11

[loss for the user ID movie ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m13s)
01:12:13

[combinations that actually appear that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m16s)
01:12:16

[its if you like use red a1 movie I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m18s)
01:12:18

[102 9 should be 3 it's actually three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m20s)
01:12:20

[and a half sauce is 0.5 like there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m22s)
01:12:22

[nothing here that's ever going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m25s)
01:12:25

[calculate a prediction or a loss for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m27s)

[only stuff that we can appear in a mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m36s)

01:12:38

[like a lot of this happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m45s)
01:12:45

[interestingly enough actually in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m46s)
01:12:46

[Netflix price so before the Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m48s)
01:12:48

[prize came along there's probabilistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m50s)
01:12:50

[matrix factorization it had actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m54s)
01:12:54

[already been invented but nobody noticed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m56s)
01:12:56

[all right and then in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h12m59s)
01:12:59

[first year of the Netflix price someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m00s)
01:13:00

[wrote this like really really famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m02s)
01:13:02

[blog post where they basically said like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m04s)
01:13:04

[hey check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[incredibly simple technique works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m08s)
01:13:08

[incredibly well when suddenly all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m10s)
01:13:10

[net fix leaderboard entries and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m12s)
01:13:12

[that's quite a few years ago now and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m17s)
01:13:17

[this is like now every collaborative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m19s)
01:13:19

[filtering approach does this not every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m21s)
01:13:21

[collaborative filtering approach adds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m23s)
01:13:23

[this sigmoid thing by the way it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m25s)
01:13:25

[like rocket science this is this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m27s)
01:13:27

[like the NLP thing we saw last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m30s)
01:13:30

[which is like hey this is a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m32s)
01:13:32

[state-of-the-art like this is you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m33s)
01:13:33

[not particularly uncommon but there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m35s)
01:13:35

[still people that don't do this it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m37s)
01:13:37

[definitely helps a lot I have to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m39s)
01:13:39

[this and so actually you know what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m41s)
01:13:41

[could do is maybe now's a good time to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m45s)
01:13:45

[have a look at the definition of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[right so the column data module contains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m50s)
01:13:50

[all these definitions and we can now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h13m56s)
01:13:56

[compare this to the thing we originally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m00s)
01:14:00

[used which was whatever came out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m03s)
01:14:03

[collaborative data set all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m07s)
01:14:07

[let's go to collab filter data set here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m09s)
01:14:09

[it is and we called get learner all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m16s)
01:14:16

[right so we can go down to get Elena and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m20s)
01:14:20

[that created a collab filter learner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m22s)
01:14:22

[passing in the model from get model is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m27s)
01:14:27

[get model so created an embedding bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m29s)
01:14:29

[and so here is embedding drop bias and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m32s)
01:14:32

[you can see here here it is like it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m37s)
01:14:37

[the same thing there's the embedding for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m40s)
01:14:40

[each of the things here's our forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m42s)
01:14:42

[that does the you times I dot some plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m44s)
01:14:44

[plus sigmoid so in fact we have just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m49s)
01:14:49

[actually rebuilt what's in the past our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m52s)
01:14:52

[library literally okay it's a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h14m55s)
01:14:55

[shorter and easier because we're taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m00s)
01:15:00

[advantage of the fact that there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m03s)
01:15:03

[special collaborative filtering data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m04s)
01:15:04

[so we can actually we're getting past in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m08s)
01:15:08

[the users and the items and we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[have to pull them out of cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m12s)
01:15:12

[Kant's but other than that this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m13s)
01:15:13

[exactly the same so hopefully you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m16s)
01:15:16

[see like the faster you have ivory is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m18s)
01:15:18

[not some inscrutable code containing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[concepts you can never understand we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m22s)
01:15:22

[actually just built up this entire thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m24s)
01:15:24

[from scratch ourselves and so why did we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m26s)
01:15:26

[get 0.76 rather than 0.8 you know I I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m31s)
01:15:31

[think it's simply because we used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m38s)
01:15:38

[stochastic gradient descent with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m40s)
01:15:40

[restarts or the cycle multiplier and an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m41s)
01:15:41

[atom optimizer you know like a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m44s)
01:15:44

[little training chase some I'm looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m46s)
01:15:46

[at this and thinking that is we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m51s)
01:15:51

[totally improve this small but maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[looking at the date and doing some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h15m58s)
01:15:58

[tricks with the date because this this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m00s)
01:16:00

[is kind of a just a regular kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m02s)
01:16:02

[smaller no way yeah you can add more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m05s)
01:16:05

[features yeah exactly exactly so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[now that you've seen this you could now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m10s)
01:16:10

[you know even if you didn't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m13s)
01:16:13

[embedding dot bias in a notebook that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m15s)
01:16:15

[you've written yourself through some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m18s)
01:16:18

[other model that's in fast AI you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m19s)
01:16:19

[look at it in faster and be like oh that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m21s)
01:16:21

[does most of the things that I'd want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m23s)
01:16:23

[do but it doesn't deal with time and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m25s)
01:16:25

[you could just go oh okay let's grab it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[copy it you know pop it into my notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m29s)
01:16:29

[and let's create you know the better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m33s)
01:16:33

[version all right and then you can start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m36s)
01:16:36

[playing that and you can now create your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m38s)
01:16:38

[own model class from the open source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m41s)
01:16:41

[code here and so yeah your that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m46s)
01:16:46

[mentioning a couple things we could do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m49s)
01:16:49

[we could try and incorporate in time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m50s)
01:16:50

[stamp so we could assume that maybe well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m52s)
01:16:52

[maybe there's just like some for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m55s)
01:16:55

[particular user over time users tend to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h16m57s)
01:16:57

[get more or less positive about movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m00s)
01:17:00

[also remember there was the list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m03s)
01:17:03

[genres for each movie maybe we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m06s)
01:17:06

[incorporate that so one problem is it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m08s)
01:17:08

[a little bit difficult to incorporate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m12s)
01:17:12

[that stuff into this embedding bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m13s)
01:17:13

[model because it's kind of it's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[custom right so what we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[next is we're going to try to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[neural net version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m25s)
01:17:25

[of this hey so the basic idea here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m27s)
01:17:27

[we're going to take exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m33s)
01:17:33

[thing as we had before here's our list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m36s)
01:17:36

[of users right and here is Erin Bates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[alright and here's our list of movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m43s)
01:17:43

[and here is our embedded right and so as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m46s)
01:17:46

[you can see I've just kind of transposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m51s)
01:17:51

[the movie ones so that so that they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m52s)
01:17:52

[all in the same orientation and here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m55s)
01:17:55

[our user movie rating but D cross tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h17m58s)
01:17:58

[okay so in the original format so each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m02s)
01:18:02

[row is a user movie rating okay so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m05s)
01:18:05

[first thing I do is I need to replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m10s)
01:18:10

[user 14 with that users contiguous in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m13s)
01:18:13

[this right and so I can do that in Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m19s)
01:18:19

[using this match that basically says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m22s)
01:18:22

[what you know how far down this list do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m25s)
01:18:25

[you have to go and it said user 14 was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m27s)
01:18:27

[the first thing in that list okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m31s)
01:18:31

[user 29 was the second thing in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m34s)
01:18:34

[list so forth okay so this is the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m36s)
01:18:36

[as that thing that we did in our Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m39s)
01:18:39

[code where we basically created a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m43s)
01:18:43

[dictionary to master so now we can for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m45s)
01:18:45

[this particular user movie rating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m49s)
01:18:49

[combination we can look up the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m52s)
01:18:52

[appropriate embedding right and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m54s)
01:18:54

[can see here what it's doing is it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h18m58s)
01:18:58

[saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m01s)
01:19:01

[all right let's basically offset from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m01s)
01:19:01

[the start of this list and the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m05s)
01:19:05

[rows we're going to go down is equal to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m08s)
01:19:08

[the user index and the number of columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m10s)
01:19:10

[we're going to go across is one two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m12s)
01:19:12

[three four or five okay and so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m14s)
01:19:14

[see what it does is it creates point one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m16s)
01:19:16

[nine point six three point three one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m18s)
01:19:18

[here it is point one nine point okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m19s)
01:19:19

[so this is literally modern embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m22s)
01:19:22

[this but remember this is exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m25s)
01:19:25

[same as doing a one hot encoding right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m29s)
01:19:29

[because if instead this was a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m34s)
01:19:34

[containing one zero zero zero zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m37s)
01:19:37

[right and we multiplied that by this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m40s)
01:19:40

[matrix then the only row it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m44s)
01:19:44

[return would be the first one okay so so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m46s)
01:19:46

[it's really useful to remember that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m51s)
01:19:51

[embedding actually just is a matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m53s)
01:19:53

[product the only reason it exists the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m56s)
01:19:56

[only reason it exists is because this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h19m59s)
01:19:59

[an optimization you know this let's pipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m02s)
01:20:02

[or to know like okay this is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m04s)
01:20:04

[matrix multiply but I guarantee you that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m07s)
01:20:07

[you know this thing is one hard encoded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m10s)
01:20:10

[therefore you don't have to actually do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m13s)
01:20:13

[the matrix multiply you can just do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[directory of that okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m16s)
01:20:16

[literally all an embedding is is it is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m19s)
01:20:19

[computational performance thing for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m21s)
01:20:21

[particular kind of matrix multiplier all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m26s)
01:20:26

[right so that looks up that uses user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m28s)
01:20:28

[and then we can look up that users movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m31s)
01:20:31

[all right so here is movie ID movie ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m34s)
01:20:34

[four one seven which apparently is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m38s)
01:20:38

[indexed number fourteen here it is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m41s)
01:20:41

[so it should have been point seven five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m43s)
01:20:43

[point four seven yes it is point seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m45s)
01:20:45

[five point plus it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m47s)
01:20:47

[so we've now got the user embedding and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m49s)
01:20:49

[the movie embedding and rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m52s)
01:20:52

[doing a dot product of those two okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h20m55s)
01:20:55

[which is what we do normally instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m02s)
01:21:02

[what if we concatenate the two together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m06s)
01:21:06

[into a single vector of length 10 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m09s)
01:21:09

[then feed that into a neural net okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m15s)
01:21:15

[and so anytime we've got you know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m19s)
01:21:19

[tensor of import activations or in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m24s)
01:21:24

[case a tensor of actually this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m27s)
01:21:27

[tensor of output activations this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[coming out of an embedding layer we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m31s)
01:21:31

[chuck it in a neural net because neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m34s)
01:21:34

[Nets we now know can calculate anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m35s)
01:21:35

[okay including hopefully collaborative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m40s)
01:21:40

[filtering so let's try that so here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m43s)
01:21:43

[our embedding net so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m46s)
01:21:46

[this time I have not bothered to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m51s)
01:21:51

[a separate bias because instead the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h21m54s)
01:21:54

[linear layer in pi torch already has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m01s)
01:22:01

[bias in it all right so when we go NN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m05s)
01:22:05

[Linea right that's kind of draw this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m10s)
01:22:10

[so we've got our U matrix right and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m18s)
01:22:18

[is the number of users and this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m24s)
01:22:24

[number of factors right and we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m27s)
01:22:27

[our M matrix that so here's our number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m31s)
01:22:31

[of movies and here's our again number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m36s)
01:22:36

[factors okay and so remember we look up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m39s)
01:22:39

[a single user we look up a single movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m42s)
01:22:42

[and let's grab them and concatenate them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m50s)
01:22:50

[together okay so here's like the user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m53s)
01:22:53

[part here's the movie part and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h22m57s)
01:22:57

[let's put that through a matrix product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m00s)
01:23:00

[right so that number of rows here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m05s)
01:23:05

[going to have to be the number of users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m08s)
01:23:08

[plus the number of movies right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[that's how long that is and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m12s)
01:23:12

[number of columns can be anything we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m14s)
01:23:14

[want because we're going to take that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m18s)
01:23:18

[in this case we're going to pick 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m23s)
01:23:23

[apparently so it's pick 10 and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m25s)
01:23:25

[we're going to stick that through a rail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m27s)
01:23:27

[you and then stick that through another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m30s)
01:23:30

[matrix which obviously needs to be of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m34s)
01:23:34

[size 10 here and then the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m37s)
01:23:37

[columns is a size 1 because we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m40s)
01:23:40

[predict a single rating okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m43s)
01:23:43

[that's our kind of flow chart of what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m51s)
01:23:51

[going on right it is a standard I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m54s)
01:23:54

[called a one hidden layer neural net it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h23m58s)
01:23:58

[depends how you think of it like there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m00s)
01:24:00

[kind of an embedding layer but because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m02s)
01:24:02

[is linear and this is linear the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m05s)
01:24:05

[together is really one linear layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m07s)
01:24:07

[right this just a computational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m09s)
01:24:09

[convenience so it's really got one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m11s)
01:24:11

[hidden layer because it's got one layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m14s)
01:24:14

[before this nonlinear activation so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m15s)
01:24:15

[order to create a linear layer with some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[number of rows and some number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m26s)
01:24:26

[columns you just go in and on in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m27s)
01:24:27

[machine learning class this week we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m31s)
01:24:31

[learnt how to create a linear layer from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m34s)
01:24:34

[scratch by creating our own weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m37s)
01:24:37

[matrix and our own biases so if you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m39s)
01:24:39

[to check that out you couldn't do so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m41s)
01:24:41

[there right but it's the same basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m43s)
01:24:43

[technique we've already seen so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m46s)
01:24:46

[create our embeddings we create our two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m51s)
01:24:51

[linear layers that's all the stuff that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m52s)
01:24:52

[we need to start with you know really if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m55s)
01:24:55

[I wanted to make this more general I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m57s)
01:24:57

[would have had another parameter here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h24m59s)
01:24:59

[called like num hidden you know equals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[equals 10 and then this would be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m08s)
01:25:08

[parameter and then you could like more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m11s)
01:25:11

[easily play around with different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m14s)
01:25:14

[numbers of activations so when we say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m16s)
01:25:16

[like okay in this layer I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m18s)
01:25:18

[create a layer with this many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m20s)
01:25:20

[activations all I mean assuming it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m21s)
01:25:21

[fully connected layer is my linear layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m25s)
01:25:25

[has how many columns in its weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m28s)
01:25:28

[matrix that's how many activations it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m30s)
01:25:30

[creates all right so we grab our users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m32s)
01:25:32

[and movies we put them through our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m36s)
01:25:36

[embedding matrix and then we concatenate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m38s)
01:25:38

[them together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m40s)
01:25:40

[okay so torch cat concatenate them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m41s)
01:25:41

[together on the first dimension so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m44s)
01:25:44

[other words we concatenate the columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m47s)
01:25:47

[together to create longer rows okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m48s)
01:25:48

[that's concatenating on dimension one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m52s)
01:25:52

[drop out we'll come back to her in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m56s)
01:25:56

[moment we've got that briefly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h25m58s)
01:25:58

[so then having done that we'll put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m01s)
01:26:01

[through that linear layer we had we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m04s)
01:26:04

[do our value and you'll notice that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m07s)
01:26:07

[value is again inside our capital F and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m10s)
01:26:10

[end up optional right it's just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m14s)
01:26:14

[function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m15s)
01:26:15

[so remember activation function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m16s)
01:26:16

[are basically things that take one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m18s)
01:26:18

[activation in and spit one activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m20s)
01:26:20

[out in this case taking something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m23s)
01:26:23

[can have negatives or positives and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m26s)
01:26:26

[truncate the negatives to zero that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m28s)
01:26:28

[what well you does and then here's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m30s)
01:26:30

[sigmoid so that's that that is now a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m34s)
01:26:34

[genuine neural network I don't know if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[get to call it deep it's only got one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m42s)
01:26:42

[hidden layer but it's definitely a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m44s)
01:26:44

[neural network all right and so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m45s)
01:26:45

[now construct it we can put it on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m48s)
01:26:48

[GPU you can create an optimizer for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m50s)
01:26:50

[and we can fit it now you'll notice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m52s)
01:26:52

[there's one other thing I've been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m56s)
01:26:56

[passing to fit which is what loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h26m57s)
01:26:57

[function are we trying to minimize okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m00s)
01:27:00

[this is the mean squared error loss and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m03s)
01:27:03

[again it's inside F okay pretty much all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m05s)
01:27:05

[the functions are inside it okay so one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m08s)
01:27:08

[of the things that you have to pass fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m12s)
01:27:12

[is something saying like how do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m14s)
01:27:14

[score it's what counts as good or bad so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m16s)
01:27:16

[it should I mean now that we have a real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m20s)
01:27:20

[neural net do we have to use the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m23s)
01:27:23

[number of embeddings for users and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m25s)
01:27:25

[that's a great question you don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m27s)
01:27:27

[absolutely right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m30s)
01:27:30

[you don't and so like we've got a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m31s)
01:27:31

[benefits here right because if we you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m34s)
01:27:34

[know think about you know we're grabbing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m38s)
01:27:38

[a user embedding or concatenating it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m45s)
01:27:45

[with a movie embedding which maybe is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m48s)
01:27:48

[like some different size but then also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m50s)
01:27:50

[perhaps we looked up the genre of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m54s)
01:27:54

[movie and like you know there's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m57s)
01:27:57

[a embedding matrix of like number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h27m59s)
01:27:59

[genres by I don't know three or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m02s)
01:28:02

[something and so like we could then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m06s)
01:28:06

[concatenate like a genre embedding and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m07s)
01:28:07

[then maybe the timestamp is in here as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m09s)
01:28:09

[continuous number right and so then that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m12s)
01:28:12

[whole thing we can then feed into you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m14s)
01:28:14

[know and you're on it all right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m18s)
01:28:18

[at the end remember a final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m24s)
01:28:24

[non-linearity was a sigmoid right so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m28s)
01:28:28

[can now recognize that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m30s)
01:28:30

[thing we did where we did sigmoid x max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m32s)
01:28:32

[reading vote - min reading + blah blah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m34s)
01:28:34

[blah is actually just another nonlinear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m36s)
01:28:36

[activation function alright remember in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m40s)
01:28:40

[our last layer we use generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m43s)
01:28:43

[different kinds of activation functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m46s)
01:28:46

[so as we said we don't need any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m48s)
01:28:48

[activation function at all right we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m51s)
01:28:51

[could just do that right but by not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m52s)
01:28:52

[having any nonlinear activation function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h28m59s)
01:28:59

[we're just making it harder so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m01s)
01:29:01

[why we put the sigmoid in there as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m03s)
01:29:03

[okay so we can then fit it in the usual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m06s)
01:29:06

[way and there we go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m10s)
01:29:10

[you know interestingly we actually got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m14s)
01:29:14

[better score than we did with our this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m15s)
01:29:15

[model so I'll be interesting to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m20s)
01:29:20

[training this with stochastic gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m23s)
01:29:23

[descent with restarts and see if it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m24s)
01:29:24

[actually better you know maybe you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m26s)
01:29:26

[play around with the number of hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m29s)
01:29:29

[layers and the drop out and whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m30s)
01:29:30

[else and see if you can come up with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m32s)
01:29:32

[know get a better answer than point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m35s)
01:29:35

[seven six ish okay so so general so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m44s)
01:29:44

[is like if you were going deep into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m50s)
01:29:50

[collaborative filtering at your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m53s)
01:29:53

[workplace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m55s)
01:29:55

[whatever this wouldn't be a bad way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m55s)
01:29:55

[go I could like I'd start out with like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m57s)
01:29:57

[oh okay here's like a flat footed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h29m59s)
01:29:59

[dataset 30 in first day I get learner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m01s)
01:30:01

[there's you know not much I can send it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m04s)
01:30:04

[basically number of factors is about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m06s)
01:30:06

[only thing that I pass in I can learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m07s)
01:30:07

[for a while maybe try a few different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m10s)
01:30:10

[approaches and then you're like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m13s)
01:30:13

[there's like that's how I go if I use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m15s)
01:30:15

[the defaults okay how do I make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m18s)
01:30:18

[better and then I'd be like dig into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m22s)
01:30:22

[code and seeing like okay well what if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m23s)
01:30:23

[Jeremy actually do here this is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m24s)
01:30:24

[what I want you know and so one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m27s)
01:30:27

[nice things about the neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m30s)
01:30:30

[approach is that you know as unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m32s)
01:30:32

[mentioned we can have different numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m36s)
01:30:36

[of embeddings we can choose how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m38s)
01:30:38

[hidden and we can also choose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m43s)
01:30:43

[drop now right so so what we're actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m45s)
01:30:45

[doing is we haven't just got real you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m51s)
01:30:51

[that we're also going like okay let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h30m52s)
01:30:52

[let's delete a few things at random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m00s)
01:31:00

[alright let's drop out so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m05s)
01:31:05

[we were deleting after the first linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m08s)
01:31:08

[layer 75% of them all right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m12s)
01:31:12

[after the second one in like 75% of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m16s)
01:31:16

[so we can add a whole lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m18s)
01:31:18

[regularization yes so you know this it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m19s)
01:31:19

[kind of feels like the this this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m22s)
01:31:22

[embedding net you know you could you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m24s)
01:31:24

[could change this again we could like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m28s)
01:31:28

[have it so that we can pass into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m29s)
01:31:29

[constructor well if you're gonna make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m31s)
01:31:31

[look as much as possible like what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m37s)
01:31:37

[had before we could surpass him peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m39s)
01:31:39

[peace equals 0.75 oh I'm not sure this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m41s)
01:31:41

[is the best API but it's not terrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m48s)
01:31:48

[probably what since we've only got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m51s)
01:31:51

[exactly two layers we could say p1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m53s)
01:31:53

[equals 0.75 v p2 v and so then this will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h31m55s)
01:31:55

[be P 1 this will be Peter you know where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m08s)
01:32:08

[we go and like if you wanted to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m18s)
01:32:18

[further you could make it look more like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m20s)
01:32:20

[our structured data learner you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m24s)
01:32:24

[actually have a thing this number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m29s)
01:32:29

[hidden you know maybe you could make a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m31s)
01:32:31

[list and so then rather than creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m34s)
01:32:34

[exactly one hidden layer and one output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m37s)
01:32:37

[layer this could be a little loop that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m40s)
01:32:40

[creates and hidden miners each one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m42s)
01:32:42

[the size you want so like this is all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m45s)
01:32:45

[stuff you can play with during the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m47s)
01:32:47

[hearing the week if you want to and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m48s)
01:32:48

[feel like if you've got like a much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m52s)
01:32:52

[smaller collaborative children data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m53s)
01:32:53

[you know maybe you need like more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m55s)
01:32:55

[regularization or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m57s)
01:32:57

[it's a much bigger one maybe more layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h32m59s)
01:32:59

[would help I don't know you know III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m02s)
01:33:02

[haven't seen much discussion of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m04s)
01:33:04

[kind of neural network approach to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m08s)
01:33:08

[collaborative filtering but I'm not a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m10s)
01:33:10

[collaborative filtering expert so maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m12s)
01:33:12

[it's maybe it's around but that'd be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m13s)
01:33:13

[interesting thing to try so the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m15s)
01:33:15

[thing I wanted to do was to talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m22s)
01:33:22

[the training loop so what's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m27s)
01:33:27

[happening inside the training loop so at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m29s)
01:33:29

[the moment we're basically passing off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m34s)
01:33:34

[the actual updating of the weights to PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m37s)
01:33:37

[torches optimizer but what I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m42s)
01:33:42

[do is like understand what that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m46s)
01:33:46

[optimizer is is actually good and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m49s)
01:33:49

[also I also want to understand what this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m52s)
01:33:52

[Momentum's him he's doing so you'll find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m54s)
01:33:54

[we have a spreadsheet called grab disk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h33m58s)
01:33:58

[gradient descent and it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m03s)
01:34:03

[designed to be read left to right sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m06s)
01:34:06

[right to left worksheet was so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m08s)
01:34:08

[rightmost worksheet is some data right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m11s)
01:34:11

[and we're going to implement gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m14s)
01:34:14

[descent in Excel because obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m16s)
01:34:16

[everybody wants to do deep learning in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m18s)
01:34:18

[it Selman we've done collaborative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m20s)
01:34:20

[filtering in Excel we've done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[convolutions in Excel so now we need SJD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m23s)
01:34:23

[in Excel so we can replace - once and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[for all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m30s)
01:34:30

[okay so let's start by creating some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m30s)
01:34:30

[data right and so here's you know here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m33s)
01:34:33

[some independent you know I've got one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m37s)
01:34:37

[column of X's you know and one column of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m40s)
01:34:40

[wise and these are actually directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m45s)
01:34:45

[linearly related so this is this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m48s)
01:34:48

[random right and this one here is equal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m50s)
01:34:50

[to x times 2 plus 30 ok so let's try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h34m54s)
01:34:54

[use Excel to take that data and try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m03s)
01:35:03

[learn those parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m09s)
01:35:09

[okay that's going to be able so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m13s)
01:35:13

[start with the most basic version of SGD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m18s)
01:35:18

[and so the first thing I'm going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m21s)
01:35:21

[is I'm going to run a macro so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m23s)
01:35:23

[see what this looks like so I'll hit run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m25s)
01:35:25

[and it does five eight bucks under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m27s)
01:35:27

[another five eight bucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m31s)
01:35:31

[- another five eight bucks okay so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m32s)
01:35:32

[first one was pretty terrible it's hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m36s)
01:35:36

[to see so I'll just delete that first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m38s)
01:35:38

[one get better scaling alright so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m39s)
01:35:39

[can see it actually it's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m45s)
01:35:45

[constantly improving the loss all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m47s)
01:35:47

[this is the loss per pot all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m50s)
01:35:50

[how do we do that so let's reset it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m53s)
01:35:53

[here is my X's and my y's and what I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h35m57s)
01:35:57

[is I start out by assuming some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m03s)
01:36:03

[intercept and some slope right so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m06s)
01:36:06

[is my randomly initialized weights so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m10s)
01:36:10

[have randomly initialized them both to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m13s)
01:36:13

[one you could pick a different random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m15s)
01:36:15

[number if you like but I promise that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m18s)
01:36:18

[randomly picked the number one twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m21s)
01:36:21

[there you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m24s)
01:36:24

[it was a random number between one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m27s)
01:36:27

[one so here is my intercept and slope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m30s)
01:36:30

[I'm just going to copy them over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m34s)
01:36:34

[right so you can literally see this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m36s)
01:36:36

[just equal see one here is equals c2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m37s)
01:36:37

[okay so I'm gonna start with my very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m41s)
01:36:41

[first row of data x equals 14 y equals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m44s)
01:36:44

[58 and my goal is to come up after I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m47s)
01:36:47

[look at this piece of data I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m51s)
01:36:51

[come up with a slightly better intercept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m53s)
01:36:53

[and a slightly better slope okay so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m54s)
01:36:54

[do that I need to first of all basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h36m59s)
01:36:59

[figure out which direction is is down in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m02s)
01:37:02

[other words if I make my intercept a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m08s)
01:37:08

[little bit higher or a little bit lower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m10s)
01:37:10

[would it make my error a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m13s)
01:37:13

[better or a little bit worse so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m15s)
01:37:15

[start out by calculating the error so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m17s)
01:37:17

[calculate the error the first thing we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m20s)
01:37:20

[need is a prediction so the prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m21s)
01:37:21

[is equal to the interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m24s)
01:37:24

[at plus x times so that is our zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m26s)
01:37:26

[hidden layer neural network okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m33s)
01:37:33

[and so here is our era it's equal to our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m36s)
01:37:36

[prediction - our actual squared so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m40s)
01:37:40

[could like play around with this I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m43s)
01:37:43

[want my error to be 18-49 I'd like it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m45s)
01:37:45

[be lower so what if we set the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m47s)
01:37:47

[intercepts to one point one 18-49 goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m49s)
01:37:49

[to 1840 okay so a higher intercept would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m54s)
01:37:54

[be better okay what about the slope to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h37m57s)
01:37:57

[increase that it goes from 1849 to 1730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m00s)
01:38:00

[okay a higher slope would be better as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m05s)
01:38:05

[well not surprising because we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m07s)
01:38:07

[actually that there should be 30 into so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m09s)
01:38:09

[one way to figure that out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m14s)
01:38:14

[you know encode and this protein is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m18s)
01:38:18

[do literally what I just did is to add a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m20s)
01:38:20

[little bit to the intercept and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m23s)
01:38:23

[slope and see what happens and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m24s)
01:38:24

[called finding the derivative through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m26s)
01:38:26

[finite differencing right and so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m27s)
01:38:27

[go ahead and do that so here is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m30s)
01:38:30

[value of my error if I add 0.01 to my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m34s)
01:38:34

[intercept all right so it's c4 plus 0.01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m40s)
01:38:40

[and then I just put that into my Lydian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m43s)
01:38:43

[function and then I subtract my actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m46s)
01:38:46

[all squared all right and so that causes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m48s)
01:38:48

[my arrow to go down a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m51s)
01:38:51

[that's our increasing my is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m53s)
01:38:53

[increasing will see for increasing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h38m59s)
01:38:59

[intercept a little bit has caused my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m01s)
01:39:01

[arrow to go down so what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m03s)
01:39:03

[derivative well the derivative is equal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m05s)
01:39:05

[to how much the dependent variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m07s)
01:39:07

[changed by divided by how much the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m09s)
01:39:09

[independent variable changed by all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m11s)
01:39:11

[right and so there it is right our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m13s)
01:39:13

[dependent variable changed by that -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m16s)
01:39:16

[that right and our independent variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m18s)
01:39:18

[we changed by 0.01 so there is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m21s)
01:39:21

[estimated value of the error dB so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m24s)
01:39:24

[remember when people talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m29s)
01:39:29

[derivatives right this is this is all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m30s)
01:39:30

[they're doing is they're saying what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m32s)
01:39:32

[this value but as we make this number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m34s)
01:39:34

[smaller and smaller and smaller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m37s)
01:39:37

[and smaller as it as limits to zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m39s)
01:39:39

[I'm not mad enough to think in terms of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m43s)
01:39:43

[like derivatives and integrals and stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m45s)
01:39:45

[like that so whatever I think about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m47s)
01:39:47

[I always think about you know an actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m49s)
01:39:49

[like plus 0.01 and divided by 0.01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m51s)
01:39:51

[because like I just find that easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m54s)
01:39:54

[just like I'd ever think about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m56s)
01:39:56

[probability density functions I always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h39m58s)
01:39:58

[think about actual probabilities of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m00s)
01:40:00

[toss a coin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m02s)
01:40:02

[something happens three times so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m03s)
01:40:03

[always think like remember it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m06s)
01:40:06

[totally fair to do this because a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m08s)
01:40:08

[computer is discrete it's not continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m10s)
01:40:10

[like a computer can't do anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m14s)
01:40:14

[infinitely small anyway right so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m15s)
01:40:15

[actually got to be calculating things at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m18s)
01:40:18

[some level of precision right and our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m21s)
01:40:21

[brains kind of need that as well so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m23s)
01:40:23

[is like my version of Jeffery Clinton's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m26s)
01:40:26

[like to visualize things in more than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m29s)
01:40:29

[two dimensions you just like say 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m31s)
01:40:31

[dimensions really quickly well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m33s)
01:40:33

[visualizing in two dimensions this is my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m34s)
01:40:34

[equivalent you know to to think about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m36s)
01:40:36

[derivatives just think about division](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m38s)
01:40:38

[and like although all the mathematicians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m41s)
01:40:41

[say no you can't do that you actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m44s)
01:40:44

[can like if you think of DX dy is being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m47s)
01:40:47

[literally you know change in X over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m49s)
01:40:49

[changing Y like the division actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m51s)
01:40:51

[like the calculations do work like all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m55s)
01:40:55

[the time so okay so let's do the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h40m58s)
01:40:58

[thing now with changing my slope by a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m01s)
01:41:01

[little bit and so here's the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m05s)
01:41:05

[right and so you can see both of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m07s)
01:41:07

[are negative okay so that's saying if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m10s)
01:41:10

[increase my intercept my loss goes down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m13s)
01:41:13

[if I increase my slope my loss goes down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m16s)
01:41:16

[right and so my derivative of my error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m20s)
01:41:20

[with respect to my slope is is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m24s)
01:41:24

[pretty high and that's not surprising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m29s)
01:41:29

[because it's actually you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m31s)
01:41:31

[constant term is just being added where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m36s)
01:41:36

[else as slope is being multiplied by 40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m37s)
01:41:37

[okay now find that differencing is all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m42s)
01:41:42

[very well and good but there's a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m48s)
01:41:48

[problem with finite difference seeing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m49s)
01:41:49

[Hyden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m52s)
01:41:52

[no spaces and the problem is this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m53s)
01:41:53

[and this is like you don't need to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h41m56s)
01:41:56

[how to calculate derivatives or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m00s)
01:42:00

[integrals but you need to learn how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m02s)
01:42:02

[think about them spatially right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m04s)
01:42:04

[remember we have some vector very high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m06s)
01:42:06

[dimensional vector it's got like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m12s)
01:42:12

[million items in it right and it's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m13s)
01:42:13

[through some weight matrix right of size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m18s)
01:42:18

[like 1 million by size a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m22s)
01:42:22

[thousand or whatever and it's spitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m24s)
01:42:24

[out something of size I hundred thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m26s)
01:42:26

[and so you need to realize like there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m28s)
01:42:28

[isn't like a gradient yeah but it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m33s)
01:42:33

[for every one of these things in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m36s)
01:42:36

[vector right there's a gradient in every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m38s)
01:42:38

[direction you know in every part of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m43s)
01:42:43

[output right so it actually has not a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m45s)
01:42:45

[single gradient number not even a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m50s)
01:42:50

[gradient vector but a gradient matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m52s)
01:42:52

[right and so this this is a lot to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h42m57s)
01:42:57

[calculate right I would literally have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m03s)
01:43:03

[to like add a little bit to this and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m04s)
01:43:04

[what happens to all of these add a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m07s)
01:43:07

[little bit to this see what happens to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m09s)
01:43:09

[all of these right to fill in one column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m11s)
01:43:11

[of this at a time so that's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m14s)
01:43:14

[horrendously slow like that so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m18s)
01:43:18

[why like if you're ever thinking like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m21s)
01:43:21

[how we can just do this with finite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m23s)
01:43:23

[differencing just remember like okay we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m24s)
01:43:24

[we're dealing in the with these very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m26s)
01:43:26

[high dimensional vectors where you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m28s)
01:43:28

[this this kind of matrix calculus like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m32s)
01:43:32

[all the concepts are identical but when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m37s)
01:43:37

[you actually draw it out like this you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m40s)
01:43:40

[suddenly realize like okay for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m42s)
01:43:42

[number I could change there's a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m44s)
01:43:44

[bunch of numbers that impacts and I have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m47s)
01:43:47

[this whole matrix of things to compute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m49s)
01:43:49

[right and so your gradient calculations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m50s)
01:43:50

[can take up a lot of memory and they can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m54s)
01:43:54

[take up a lot of time so we want to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m56s)
01:43:56

[some way to do this more quickly okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h43m59s)
01:43:59

[and it's definitely well worth like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m05s)
01:44:05

[spending time kind of studying these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m07s)
01:44:07

[ideas of like you know the idea of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m10s)
01:44:10

[the gradients like look up things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m14s)
01:44:14

[Jacobian and Hessian they're the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m16s)
01:44:16

[that you want to search for just that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m24s)
01:44:24

[unfortunately people normally write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m27s)
01:44:27

[about them with you know lots of great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m29s)
01:44:29

[letters and bla bla bla right but there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m32s)
01:44:32

[are some there are some nice you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m35s)
01:44:35

[intuitive explanations out there and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m39s)
01:44:39

[hopefully you can share them on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m41s)

[understand in here you know because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m47s)
01:44:47

[you're trying to train something and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m51s)
01:44:51

[it's not working properly and like later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m54s)

[hi torch to like actually get the values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h44m58s)
01:44:58

[of the gradients and you need to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m00s)
01:45:00

[like okay well how would I like what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m02s)
01:45:02

[gradients you know what would I consider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m04s)
01:45:04

[unusual like you know these are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m06s)
01:45:06

[things that turn you into a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m08s)
01:45:08

[awesome deep learning practitioner is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m10s)
01:45:10

[when you can like debug your problems by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m13s)
01:45:13

[like grabbing the gradients and doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m15s)
01:45:15

[histograms of them and like knowing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m17s)
01:45:17

[know that you could like plot that all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m19s)
01:45:19

[each layer my average gradients getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m21s)
01:45:21

[worse or you know bigger okay so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m23s)
01:45:23

[trick to doing this more quickly is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m28s)
01:45:28

[do it analytically rather than through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m30s)
01:45:30

[finite differencing and so analytically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m34s)
01:45:34

[is basically there is a list you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m37s)
01:45:37

[probably all learned it at high school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m40s)
01:45:40

[there is a literally a list of rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m41s)
01:45:41

[that for every mathematical function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m42s)
01:45:42

[there's a like this is the derivative of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m46s)
01:45:46

[that function so you probably remember a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m48s)
01:45:48

[few of them for example x squared - it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h45m53s)
01:45:53

[alright and so we actually have here an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m00s)
01:46:00

[x squared so here is our two x right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m02s)
01:46:02

[the one that I actually want you to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m07s)
01:46:07

[is not any of the individual rules but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m10s)
01:46:10

[want you to know the chain rule right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m15s)
01:46:15

[which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m17s)
01:46:17

[you've got some function of some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m19s)
01:46:19

[function of something why is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m22s)
01:46:22

[important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m25s)
01:46:25

[I don't know that's a linear layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m26s)
01:46:26

[that's a rally right and then we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m28s)
01:46:28

[kind of keep going backwards map etc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m33s)
01:46:33

[right a neural net is just a function of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m37s)
01:46:37

[a function of a function of a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m42s)
01:46:42

[where the innermost is you know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m43s)
01:46:43

[basically linear rally your linear rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m45s)
01:46:45

[your dot linear sigmoid or soft mass all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h46m49s)
01:46:49

[right and so it's a function of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m00s)
01:47:00

[function of a function and so therefore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m02s)
01:47:02

[to calculate the derivative of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m03s)
01:47:03

[weights in your model the loss of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m06s)
01:47:06

[model with respect to the weights of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m10s)
01:47:10

[your model you're going to need to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m12s)
01:47:12

[the chain rule and specifically whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m13s)
01:47:13

[layer it is that you're up to like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m15s)
01:47:15

[want to calculate the derivative here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m17s)
01:47:17

[and got a need to use all of these all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m19s)
01:47:19

[of these ones because that's all that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m23s)
01:47:23

[that's the function that's being applied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m24s)
01:47:24

[right and that's why they call this back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m25s)
01:47:25

[propagation because the value of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m28s)
01:47:28

[derivative of that is equal to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m30s)
01:47:30

[derivative now basically you can do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m36s)
01:47:36

[like this you can say let's call you is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m39s)
01:47:39

[this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m43s)
01:47:43

[let's call that you all right then it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m44s)
01:47:44

[simply equal to the derivative of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m47s)
01:47:47

[times derivative of that right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m51s)
01:47:51

[you just multiply them together and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m56s)
01:47:56

[that's what back propagation is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h47m59s)
01:47:59

[it's not that back propagation is a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m00s)
01:48:00

[thing for you to learn it's not a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m03s)
01:48:03

[algorithm it is literally take the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m06s)
01:48:06

[derivative of every one of your layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m10s)
01:48:10

[and multiply them all together so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m12s)
01:48:12

[it doesn't deserve a new name right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m16s)
01:48:16

[apply the chain rule to my layers does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m18s)
01:48:18

[not deserve a new name but it gets one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m23s)
01:48:23

[because us neural networks folk really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m24s)
01:48:24

[need to seem as clever as possible it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m27s)
01:48:27

[really important that everybody else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m29s)
01:48:29

[thinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m31s)
01:48:31

[we are way outside of their capabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m32s)
01:48:32

[so the fact that you're here means that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m34s)
01:48:34

[we've failed because you guys somehow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m37s)
01:48:37

[think that you're capable right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m39s)
01:48:39

[remember it's really important when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m41s)
01:48:41

[talk to other people that you say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m43s)
01:48:43

[backpropagation and rectified linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m45s)
01:48:45

[unit rather than like multiply the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m48s)
01:48:48

[layers gradients or replace negatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m51s)
01:48:51

[with zeros okay so so here we go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m54s)
01:48:54

[so here is so I've just gone ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h48m57s)
01:48:57

[grabbed the derivative unfortunately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m00s)
01:49:00

[there is no automatic differentiation in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m03s)
01:49:03

[Excel yet so I did the alternative which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m05s)
01:49:05

[is to paste the formula into Wolfram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m07s)
01:49:07

[Alpha and got back the derivative so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m09s)
01:49:09

[there's the first derivative and there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m12s)
01:49:12

[the second derivative analytically we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m14s)
01:49:14

[only have one layer in this infinite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m16s)
01:49:16

[finally small neural network so we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m19s)
01:49:19

[have to worry about the chain rule and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m21s)
01:49:21

[we should see that this analytical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m23s)
01:49:23

[derivative is pretty close to our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m25s)
01:49:25

[estimated derivative from the find out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m27s)
01:49:27

[differencing and indeed it is right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m28s)
01:49:28

[we should see that these ones are pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m31s)
01:49:31

[similar as well and indeed they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m33s)
01:49:33

[right and if you're you know back when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m35s)
01:49:35

[implemented my own neural Nets 20 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m38s)
01:49:38

[ago I you know had to actually calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m41s)
01:49:41

[the derivatives and so I always would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m45s)
01:49:45

[write like had something that would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m46s)
01:49:46

[check the derivatives using finite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m48s)
01:49:48

[difference in and so for those poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m50s)
01:49:50

[people that they'd have to write these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m52s)
01:49:52

[things by hand you'll still see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m53s)
01:49:53

[they have like a finite differencing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m55s)
01:49:55

[checkout so if you ever do have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m57s)
01:49:57

[implement a derivative by hand please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h49m59s)
01:49:59

[make sure that you have a finite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m02s)
01:50:02

[differencing checker so that you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m05s)
01:50:05

[test it alright so there's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m07s)
01:50:07

[derivatives so we know that if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m10s)
01:50:10

[increase B then we're going to get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m13s)
01:50:13

[slightly better loss so let's increase B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m17s)
01:50:17

[by a bit how much should we increase it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m19s)
01:50:19

[by well we'll increase it by some more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m22s)
01:50:22

[for this so the motor-pod we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m24s)
01:50:24

[choose is called a learning rate and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m26s)
01:50:26

[here's our learning rate so here's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m28s)
01:50:28

[enoch 4 ok so our new value is equal to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m29s)
01:50:29

[whatever it was before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m37s)
01:50:37

[- our derivative times our learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m39s)
01:50:39

[okay so we've gone from one to one point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m45s)
01:50:45

[or one and then a we've done the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m47s)
01:50:47

[thing so it's gone from one to one point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m52s)
01:50:52

[one two so this is a special kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h50m56s)
01:50:56

[mini batch it's a mini batch of size one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m00s)
01:51:00

[okay so we call this online grading does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m02s)
01:51:02

[it just means mini batch of size one so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m04s)
01:51:04

[then we can go into the next one next is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m09s)
01:51:09

[86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m11s)
01:51:11

[why is 202 right this is my intercept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m11s)
01:51:11

[and slope copied across from the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m15s)
01:51:15

[row okay so here's my new wire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m17s)
01:51:17

[prediction here's my new era here are my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m22s)
01:51:22

[derivatives here are my new a and B okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m26s)
01:51:26

[so we keep doing that for every mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m29s)
01:51:29

[batch of one until eventually we run out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m32s)
01:51:32

[at the end of the new pocket okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m37s)
01:51:37

[then at the end of an epoch we would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m41s)
01:51:41

[grab our intercept and slope and paste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m43s)
01:51:43

[them back over here as our new values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m48s)
01:51:48

[there we are and we can now continue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m53s)
01:51:53

[again all right so we're now starting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m56s)
01:51:56

[with pops today's either in the wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h51m59s)
01:51:59

[spot it should be pasted special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m02s)
01:52:02

[transpose values all right okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m06s)
01:52:06

[so there's a new intercept there's any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m10s)
01:52:10

[slope possibly I got that the wrong way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m12s)
01:52:12

[around but anyway you get the idea and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m13s)
01:52:13

[then we continue okay so I recorded the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m15s)
01:52:15

[world's tiniest macro which literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m19s)
01:52:19

[just copies the final slope and puts it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m22s)
01:52:22

[into the new slope copies the final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m29s)
01:52:29

[intercept put the new intercept and does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m32s)
01:52:32

[that five times and after each time it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m36s)
01:52:36

[grabs the root mean squared error and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m40s)
01:52:40

[pastes it into the next spare area and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m42s)
01:52:42

[that is attached to this Run button and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m45s)
01:52:45

[so that's going to go ahead and do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m48s)
01:52:48

[five times okay so that's stochastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m49s)
01:52:49

[gradient descent and if so so to turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m53s)
01:52:53

[this into a CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m57s)
01:52:57

[all right you would just replace this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h52m58s)
01:52:58

[error function right and therefore this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m02s)
01:53:02

[prediction with the output of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m05s)
01:53:05

[convolutional example spreadsheet okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m08s)
01:53:08

[and that then would be in CNN being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m12s)
01:53:12

[trained with with SGD okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m15s)
01:53:15

[now the problem is that you'll see when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m19s)
01:53:19

[I run this it's kind of going very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m24s)
01:53:24

[slowly right we know that we need to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m30s)
01:53:30

[to a slope of two and an intercept of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m32s)
01:53:32

[thirty and you can kind of see it this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m35s)
01:53:35

[rate it's going to take a very long time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m37s)
01:53:37

[right and specifically it's like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m40s)
01:53:40

[keeps going the same direction so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m49s)
01:53:49

[like come on take a hint that's a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m51s)
01:53:51

[direction so they come on take a hint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m53s)
01:53:53

[that's a good direction please keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m56s)
01:53:56

[doing that but more is called momentum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h53m58s)
01:53:58

[right so on our next spreadsheet we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m01s)
01:54:01

[going to implement momentum okay so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m05s)
01:54:05

[momentum does is the same thing and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m11s)
01:54:11

[to simplify this spreadsheet I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m14s)
01:54:14

[removed the finite difference cause okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m16s)
01:54:16

[other than that this is just the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m19s)
01:54:19

[right so it's true what our X is our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m21s)
01:54:21

[wise A's and B's predictions our error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m22s)
01:54:22

[is now over here okay and here's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m28s)
01:54:28

[derivatives okay our new calculation for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m32s)
01:54:32

[this particular row our new calculation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m39s)
01:54:39

[here for our new a term just like before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m45s)
01:54:45

[is is equal to whatever a was before -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m49s)
01:54:49

[okay now this time I'm not taking the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m56s)
01:54:56

[derivative but I'm - income other number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h54m59s)
01:54:59

[times the loan rate so what's this other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m01s)
01:55:01

[number okay so this other number is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m03s)
01:55:03

[equal to the derivative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m08s)
01:55:08

[times what's this k 1.02 plus 0.98 times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m13s)
01:55:13

[the thing just above it okay so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m22s)
01:55:22

[a linear interpolation between this rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m26s)
01:55:26

[derivative for this mini-batches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m31s)
01:55:31

[derivative and whatever direction we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m32s)
01:55:32

[went last time right so in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m35s)
01:55:35

[keep going the same direction as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m39s)
01:55:39

[were before right then update it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m41s)
01:55:41

[little bit right and so in our rich in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m44s)
01:55:44

[our Python just before we had a momentum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m48s)
01:55:48

[of 0.9 okay so you can see what tends to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m51s)
01:55:51

[happen is that our negative kind of gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h55m55s)
01:55:55

[more and more negative right all the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m01s)
01:56:01

[up to like 2,000 where else with our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m03s)
01:56:03

[standard SGD approach a derivatives are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m08s)
01:56:08

[kind of all over the place right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m11s)
01:56:11

[sometimes there's 700 something negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m14s)
01:56:14

[7 positive 100 you know so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m16s)
01:56:16

[basically saying like yeah if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m18s)
01:56:18

[been going down for quite a while keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m21s)
01:56:21

[doing that until finally here it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m24s)
01:56:24

[okay that's that seems to be far enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m26s)
01:56:26

[so that's being less and less and less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m28s)
01:56:28

[negative all right mister we start being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m29s)
01:56:29

[positive again so you can kind of see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m32s)
01:56:32

[why it's called momentum it's like once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m34s)
01:56:34

[you start traveling in a particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m35s)
01:56:35

[direction for a particular weight you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m37s)
01:56:37

[kind of the wheel start spinning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m40s)
01:56:40

[then once the gradient turns around the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m41s)
01:56:41

[other way it's like Oh slow down we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m44s)
01:56:44

[got this kind of event um and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m46s)
01:56:46

[finally turn back around right so when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m48s)
01:56:48

[we do it this way all right we can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m51s)
01:56:51

[exactly the same thing right and after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m57s)
01:56:57

[five iterations we're at 89 where else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h56m59s)
01:56:59

[before after five iterations we're at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m04s)
01:57:04

[104 right and after a few more let's go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m07s)
01:57:07

[maybe 15 okay so get this 102 for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m11s)
01:57:11

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m20s)
01:57:20

[it's going right so it's it's it's a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m26s)
01:57:26

[better it's not hips better you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m30s)
01:57:30

[still see like these numbers they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m31s)
01:57:31

[zipping along right but it's definitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m35s)
01:57:35

[an improvement and it also gives us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m38s)
01:57:38

[something else to tune which is nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m40s)
01:57:40

[like so if this is kind of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m41s)
01:57:41

[well-behaved error surface right in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m43s)
01:57:43

[other words like although it might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m45s)
01:57:45

[bumpy along the way there's kind of some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m48s)
01:57:48

[overall direction like imagine you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m50s)
01:57:50

[going down a hill right and there's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m53s)
01:57:53

[bumps oh alright so the mobile more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m55s)
01:57:55

[momentum you got going to skipping over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m57s)
01:57:57

[the tops right so we could say like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h57m59s)
01:57:59

[let's increase our beater up to 0.98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m01s)
01:58:01

[right and see if that like allows us to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m03s)
01:58:03

[train a little faster and whoa look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m06s)
01:58:06

[that suddenly what's going to okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m08s)
01:58:08

[one nice thing about things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m10s)
01:58:10

[momentum is it's like another parameter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m12s)
01:58:12

[that you can choose to try and make your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m13s)
01:58:13

[model train better in practice basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m16s)
01:58:16

[everybody does this every like you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m21s)
01:58:21

[at any like image net winner or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m24s)
01:58:24

[they all use momentum okay and so back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m26s)
01:58:26

[over here when we said here's SGD that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m37s)
01:58:37

[basically means use the basic tab of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m41s)
01:58:41

[Excel spreadsheet but then momentum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m44s)
01:58:44

[equals 0.9 means add in put a point nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m46s)
01:58:46

[over here okay and so that that's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m52s)
01:58:52

[of your like default starting point so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h58m58s)
01:58:58

[let's keep going and talk about Adam so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m03s)
01:59:03

[Adam is something which I actually was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m12s)
01:59:12

[not right earlier on in this course I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m18s)
01:59:18

[said we've been using Adam by default we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m20s)
01:59:20

[actually haven't we've actually been I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m22s)
01:59:22

[noticed our we've actually been using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m24s)
01:59:24

[SGD with momentum by default and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m25s)
01:59:25

[reason is that Adam has had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m29s)
01:59:29

[much faster as you'll see it's much much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m34s)
01:59:34

[faster to learn with but there's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m36s)
01:59:36

[some problems which is people who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m38s)
01:59:38

[haven't been getting quite as good like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m39s)
01:59:39

[final answers with Adam as they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m41s)
01:59:41

[with std with momentum and that's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m44s)
01:59:44

[you'll see like all the you know image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m46s)
01:59:46

[net winning solutions and so forth and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m48s)
01:59:48

[all the academic papers always use SGD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m50s)
01:59:50

[with momentum and I'll Adam seems to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m54s)
01:59:54

[a particular problem in NLP people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m56s)
01:59:56

[really haven't got Adam working at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=01h59m58s)
01:59:58

[well the good news is this was I built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m00s)
02:00:00

[it looks like this was solved two weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m06s)
02:00:06

[ago it basically it turned out that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m08s)
02:00:08

[way people were dealing with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m13s)
02:00:13

[combination of weight decay in Adam had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m14s)
02:00:14

[a nasty kind of bargainer basically and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m17s)
02:00:17

[that's that's kind of carried through to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m20s)
02:00:20

[every single library and one of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m22s)
02:00:22

[students and then Sahara has actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m24s)
02:00:24

[just completed a prototype of adding is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m27s)
02:00:27

[this new version of Adam has called Adam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m31s)
02:00:31

[W into fast AI and he's confirmed that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m33s)
02:00:33

[he's getting much faster both the faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m36s)
02:00:36

[performance and also the better accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m40s)
02:00:40

[so hopefully we'll have this Adam W in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m43s)
02:00:43

[faster ideally before next week we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m47s)
02:00:47

[see how we go very very soon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m49s)
02:00:49

[so so it is worth telling you about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m51s)
02:00:51

[about Adam so let's talk about it it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m53s)
02:00:53

[actually incredibly simple but again you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h00m58s)
02:00:58

[know make sure you make it sound really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m02s)
02:01:02

[complicated when you tell people so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m04s)
02:01:04

[you can so here's the same spreadsheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m06s)
02:01:06

[again right and here's our randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m09s)
02:01:09

[selected a and B again somehow it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m13s)
02:01:13

[still one here's a prediction here's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m16s)
02:01:16

[derivatives okay so now how we count](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m19s)
02:01:19

[letting on you hey you could immediately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m21s)
02:01:21

[see it's looking pretty hopeful because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m25s)
02:01:25

[even by like row ten we're like we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m28s)
02:01:28

[seeing the numbers move a lot more right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m31s)
02:01:31

[so this is looking pretty encouraging so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m34s)
02:01:34

[how are we calculating this it's equal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m38s)
02:01:38

[to our previous value with B minus j h](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m42s)
02:01:42

[we're gonna have to find out what that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m48s)
02:01:48

[is times our learning rate divided by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m49s)
02:01:49

[the square root of LH okay so I'm gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m56s)
02:01:56

[have to dig it and see what's going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h01m59s)
02:01:59

[one thing to notice here is that my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m00s)
02:02:00

[learning rate is way higher than it used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m02s)
02:02:02

[to be but then we're dividing it by this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m05s)
02:02:05

[big number okay so let's start out by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m08s)
02:02:08

[looking and seeing what this day-out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m12s)
02:02:12

[thing is okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m14s)
02:02:14

[j8 is identical to what we had before j8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m19s)
02:02:19

[is equal to the linear interpolation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m23s)
02:02:23

[the derivative and the previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m25s)
02:02:25

[direction okay so that was easy so one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m28s)
02:02:28

[part of atom is to use momentum in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m33s)
02:02:33

[way we just defined it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m36s)
02:02:36

[okay the second piece was to divide by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m39s)
02:02:39

[square root L 8 what is that square root](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m41s)
02:02:41

[L 8 okay is another linear interpolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m45s)
02:02:45

[of something and something else and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m48s)
02:02:48

[specifically it's a linear interpolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m52s)
02:02:52

[of F 8 squared okay it's a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h02m54s)
02:02:54

[interpolation of the derivative squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m00s)
02:03:00

[along with the derivative squared last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m03s)
02:03:03

[time okay so in other words we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m07s)
02:03:07

[two pieces of momentum going on here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m09s)
02:03:09

[one is calculating the momentum version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m13s)
02:03:13

[of the gradient the other is calculating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m19s)
02:03:19

[the momentum version of the gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m22s)
02:03:22

[squared and we often refer to this idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m24s)
02:03:24

[as a exponentially weighted moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m28s)
02:03:28

[average in other words it's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m31s)
02:03:31

[equal to the average of this one and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m34s)
02:03:34

[last one in the last one in the last one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m36s)
02:03:36

[that we're like multiplicatively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m37s)
02:03:37

[decreasing the previous ones right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m39s)
02:03:39

[because we're multiplying it by 0.9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m42s)
02:03:42

[times what 999 and so you actually see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m44s)
02:03:44

[that for instance in the faster I code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h03m47s)
02:03:47

[if you look at fish we don't just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m00s)
02:04:00

[calculate the average loss right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m04s)
02:04:04

[what I actually want we certainly don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m10s)
02:04:10

[just report the loss for every mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m13s)
02:04:13

[match because that just bounces around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m14s)
02:04:14

[so much so instead I say average loss is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m16s)
02:04:16

[equal to whatever the average loss was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m20s)
02:04:20

[last time times 0.98 plus the loss this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m22s)
02:04:22

[time times 0.02 right so in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m27s)
02:04:27

[the faster you library the thing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m31s)
02:04:31

[it's actually when you do like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m34s)
02:04:34

[learning rate finder or plot loss it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m36s)
02:04:36

[actually showing you the exponentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m38s)
02:04:38

[weighted moving average of the loss okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m40s)
02:04:40

[so it's like a really handy concept it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m44s)
02:04:44

[appears quite a lot right the other in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m47s)
02:04:47

[handy concept know about is this idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m49s)
02:04:49

[like you've got two numbers one of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m52s)
02:04:52

[is multiplied by some value the other is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m55s)
02:04:55

[multiplied by one minus that value so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h04m58s)
02:04:58

[this is a linear interpolation of two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m00s)
02:05:00

[values you'll see it all the time and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m02s)
02:05:02

[for some reason deep learning people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m05s)
02:05:05

[nearly always use the value alpha when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m09s)
02:05:09

[they do this so like keep an eye out if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m11s)
02:05:11

[you're reading a paper or something and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m13s)
02:05:13

[you see like alpha times bla bla bla bla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m15s)
02:05:15

[bla plus one minus alpha times some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m17s)
02:05:17

[other bla bla bla bla right immediately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m22s)
02:05:22

[like when people read papers none of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m25s)
02:05:25

[like read every thing in the equation we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m28s)
02:05:28

[look at it we go oh linear interpolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m31s)
02:05:31

[right and I said something I was just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m33s)
02:05:33

[talking to Rachel about yesterday is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m35s)
02:05:35

[like whether we could start trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m37s)
02:05:37

[find like a a new way of writing papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m39s)
02:05:39

[where we literally refactor them right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m42s)
02:05:42

[like it'd be so much better to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m44s)
02:05:44

[written like linear interpolate bla bla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m45s)
02:05:45

[bla bla bla right because then you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m50s)
02:05:50

[have to have that pattern recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m52s)
02:05:52

[right but until we convince the world to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m55s)
02:05:55

[change how they write papers this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m57s)
02:05:57

[what you have to do is you have to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h05m59s)
02:05:59

[you know know what to look for right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m00s)
02:06:00

[once you do suddenly the huge page with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m03s)
02:06:03

[formulas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m06s)
02:06:06

[that at all like you often notice like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m09s)
02:06:09

[for example the two things in here like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m11s)
02:06:11

[they might be totally identical but this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m13s)
02:06:13

[might be a time T and this might be at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m15s)
02:06:15

[like time t minus y or something right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m17s)
02:06:17

[like it's very often these big ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m19s)
02:06:19

[formulas turn out to be really really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m21s)
02:06:21

[simple if only they had ripped out them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m24s)
02:06:24

[okay so what are we doing with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m26s)
02:06:26

[gradient squared so what we were doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m30s)
02:06:30

[with the gradient squared is we were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m34s)
02:06:34

[taking the square root and then we were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m37s)
02:06:37

[adjusting the learning rate by dividing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m40s)
02:06:40

[the learning rate by that okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m42s)
02:06:42

[gradient squared is always positive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m45s)
02:06:45

[right and we're taking the exponentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m49s)
02:06:49

[waiting move moving average of a bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m53s)
02:06:53

[of things that are always positive and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m55s)
02:06:55

[then we're taking the square root of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m57s)
02:06:57

[that right so when is this number going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h06m58s)
02:06:58

[to be high it's going to be particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m01s)
02:07:01

[high if there's like one big you know if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m04s)
02:07:04

[the gradients got a lot of variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m07s)
02:07:07

[that's oh there's a high variance of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m09s)
02:07:09

[gradient then this G squared thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m11s)
02:07:11

[going to be a really high number for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m14s)
02:07:14

[if it's like a constant amount right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m16s)
02:07:16

[it's going to be smaller that cuz when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m20s)
02:07:20

[you add things that are squared the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m22s)
02:07:22

[squared slight jump out much bigger for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m24s)
02:07:24

[us if there wasn't if there wasn't much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m26s)
02:07:26

[change it's not going to be as big so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m28s)
02:07:28

[basically this number at the bottom here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m31s)
02:07:31

[is going to be high if our Brady --nt is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m34s)
02:07:34

[changing a lot now what do you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m38s)
02:07:38

[do if you've got something which is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m41s)
02:07:41

[first negative and then positive and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m44s)
02:07:44

[then small and then high right well you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m46s)
02:07:46

[probably want to be more careful right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m50s)
02:07:50

[you probably don't want to take a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m53s)
02:07:53

[step because you can't really trust it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m54s)
02:07:54

[right so when the when the variance of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m56s)
02:07:56

[the gradient is high we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h07m59s)
02:07:59

[divide our learning rate by a big number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m01s)
02:08:01

[we also found learning rate is very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m03s)
02:08:03

[similar kind of size all the time then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m06s)
02:08:06

[we probably feel pretty good about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m09s)
02:08:09

[step so we're dividing it by a small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m11s)
02:08:11

[amount yeah and so this is called an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m13s)
02:08:13

[adaptive learning rate yeah and like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m15s)
02:08:15

[lot of people have this confusion about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m18s)
02:08:18

[atom I've seen it on the forum actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m19s)
02:08:19

[like there's some kind of adaptive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m22s)
02:08:22

[learning rate where somehow you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m24s)
02:08:24

[setting different learning rates for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m26s)
02:08:26

[different layers or something it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m29s)
02:08:29

[no not really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m31s)
02:08:31

[right all we're doing is we're just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m33s)
02:08:33

[saying like this keep track of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m35s)
02:08:35

[average of the squares of the gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m37s)
02:08:37

[and use that to adjust the learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m39s)
02:08:39

[so there's still one learning rate okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m43s)
02:08:43

[in this case it's one okay but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m45s)
02:08:45

[effectively every parameter at every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m48s)
02:08:48

[epoch is being kind of like getting a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m51s)
02:08:51

[bigger jump if the learning rate if the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m55s)
02:08:55

[gradients been pretty constant for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m57s)
02:08:57

[wait and a smaller jump otherwise okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h08m58s)
02:08:58

[and that's Adam that's the entirety of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m02s)
02:09:02

[Adam in in Excel right so there's now no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m04s)
02:09:04

[reason at all why you can't train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m07s)
02:09:07

[imagenet in Excel because you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m09s)
02:09:09

[you've got access to all of the pieces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m11s)
02:09:11

[you need and so let's try this out run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m13s)
02:09:13

[okay that's not bad right five and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m19s)
02:09:19

[straight up to twenty nine and two right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m22s)
02:09:22

[so the difference between like you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m25s)
02:09:25

[standard SGD and this is is huge and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m28s)
02:09:28

[basically that you know the key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m31s)
02:09:31

[difference was that it figured out that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m32s)
02:09:32

[we need to be you know moving this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m35s)
02:09:35

[number much faster okay and so and so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m37s)
02:09:37

[do and so you can see we've now got like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m42s)
02:09:42

[two different parameters one is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m45s)
02:09:45

[momentum for the gradient piece the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m48s)
02:09:48

[other is the momentum for the gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m50s)
02:09:50

[squared piece and there I think they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m52s)
02:09:52

[called like I think there's just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m56s)
02:09:56

[couple of the beta I think when you when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h09m58s)
02:09:58

[you want to change it in PI tortes is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m00s)
02:10:00

[think what beta which is just a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m02s)
02:10:02

[of two numbers you can change Jeremy so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m03s)
02:10:03

[so you set the yeah I think I understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m11s)
02:10:11

[this concept of you know one day when a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m15s)
02:10:15

[gradient is it goes up and down then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m18s)
02:10:18

[you're not really sure which direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m21s)
02:10:21

[should should go so you should kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m24s)
02:10:24

[slow things down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m26s)
02:10:26

[therefore you subtract that gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m27s)
02:10:27

[from the learning rate so but how do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m29s)
02:10:29

[implement how far do you go I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m32s)
02:10:32

[maybe I miss something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m35s)
02:10:35

[early on you do you set a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m36s)
02:10:36

[somewhere we divide yeah we divide the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m38s)
02:10:38

[learning rate divided by the square root](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m42s)
02:10:42

[of the moving average gradient squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m45s)
02:10:45

[so that's where we use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m48s)
02:10:48

[oh I'm sorry can you be a little more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m50s)
02:10:50

[sure so d2 is the learning rate which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m55s)
02:10:55

[one yeah m27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h10m57s)
02:10:57

[is our moving average of the squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m00s)
02:11:00

[gradients so we just go D 2 divided by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m02s)
02:11:02

[square root and preserve that's it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m06s)
02:11:06

[thanks I have one question yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m12s)
02:11:12

[so the new method that you just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m16s)
02:11:16

[mentioned which is in the process of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m19s)
02:11:19

[getting implemented in yes how different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m21s)
02:11:21

[is it from here okay let's do that so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m27s)
02:11:27

[understand Adam W we have to understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m32s)
02:11:32

[wait okay and maybe we'll learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m34s)
02:11:34

[about that later let's see how we go now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m38s)
02:11:38

[with great okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m39s)
02:11:39

[so the idea is that when you have lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m40s)
02:11:40

[and lots of parameters like we do with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m46s)
02:11:46

[you know most of the neural Nets we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m48s)
02:11:48

[train you very often have like more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m50s)
02:11:50

[parameters and data points or you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m54s)
02:11:54

[like regularization becomes important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m56s)
02:11:56

[and we've learnt how to avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h11m57s)
02:11:57

[overfitting by using dropout right which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m00s)
02:12:00

[randomly deletes some activations in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m03s)
02:12:03

[hope that's going to learn some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m07s)
02:12:07

[more resilient set of weights there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m08s)
02:12:08

[another kind of Ritter ization we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m12s)
02:12:12

[use called weight decay or l2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m14s)
02:12:14

[regularization and it's actually comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m16s)
02:12:16

[kind of as a kind of classic statistical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m19s)
02:12:19

[technique and the idea is that we take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m21s)
02:12:21

[our loss function right so we take out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m23s)
02:12:23

[like arrow squared loss function and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m26s)
02:12:26

[add an additional piece to it let's add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m29s)
02:12:29

[weight decay right now the additional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m32s)
02:12:32

[piece we add is to basically add the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m35s)
02:12:35

[square of the weights so we'd say plus B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m39s)
02:12:39

[squared plus a squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m44s)
02:12:44

[okay that is now wait 2 K or L tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m49s)
02:12:49

[regularization and so the idea is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m55s)
02:12:55

[now the the loss function wants to keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h12m58s)
02:12:58

[the weight small because increasing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m04s)
02:13:04

[weights makes the loss worse and so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m07s)
02:13:07

[only going to increase the weights if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m10s)
02:13:10

[the loss improves by more than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m12s)
02:13:12

[amount of that penalty and in fact to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m15s)
02:13:15

[make this weight to get to proper weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m17s)
02:13:17

[decay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m19s)
02:13:19

[we then need some multiplier yeah right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m20s)
02:13:20

[so if you remember back in our here we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m24s)
02:13:24

[said weight decay equals W d5e neg 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m27s)
02:13:27

[okay so to actually use the same way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m31s)
02:13:31

[K I would have to multiply by 0.005 all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m33s)
02:13:33

[right so that's actually now the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m39s)
02:13:39

[weight okay so if you have a really high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m41s)
02:13:41

[weight decay that it's going to set all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m47s)
02:13:47

[the parameters to zero so it'll never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m49s)
02:13:49

[over fit right because it can't set any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m52s)
02:13:52

[parameter to anything and so as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m55s)
02:13:55

[gradually decrease the weight decay a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m57s)
02:13:57

[few more weights can actually be used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h13m59s)
02:13:59

[right but the ones that don't help much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m02s)
02:14:02

[it's still going to leave at zero or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m05s)
02:14:05

[close to zero right so that's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m07s)
02:14:07

[that's what weight decay is is is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m11s)
02:14:11

[literally to change the loss function to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m14s)
02:14:14

[a D in this sum of squares of weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m16s)
02:14:16

[times some parameter some hyper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m21s)
02:14:21

[parameter I should say the problem is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m25s)
02:14:25

[that if you put that into the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m28s)
02:14:28

[function as I have here then it ends up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m31s)
02:14:31

[in the moving average of gradients and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m35s)
02:14:35

[the moving average of Squared's of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m38s)
02:14:38

[gradients for atom right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m39s)
02:14:39

[basically we end up when there's a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m42s)
02:14:42

[of variation we end up decreasing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m46s)
02:14:46

[amount of weight decay and if there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m52s)
02:14:52

[very little variation we end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m53s)
02:14:53

[increasing the amount of weight decay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m55s)
02:14:55

[we end up basically saying penalize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h14m56s)
02:14:56

[parameters you know weights that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m00s)
02:15:00

[really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m02s)
02:15:02

[hi unless their gradient varies a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m03s)
02:15:03

[which is never what we intended right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m06s)
02:15:06

[that's just not not the plan at all so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m09s)
02:15:09

[the trick with Adam W is we basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m12s)
02:15:12

[remove weight decay from here so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m15s)
02:15:15

[not in the last function it's not in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m19s)
02:15:19

[G not in the G squared and we move it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m22s)
02:15:22

[that instead it's it's it's added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m25s)
02:15:25

[directly to the when we update with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m28s)
02:15:28

[learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m31s)
02:15:31

[it's out of there instead so in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m32s)
02:15:32

[words it would be we would put the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m34s)
02:15:34

[weight decay or I should a gradient of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m36s)
02:15:36

[the weight decay in here when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m38s)
02:15:38

[calculate the new a mu V so it never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m40s)
02:15:40

[ends up in our G M G squared so that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m42s)
02:15:42

[like a super fast description which will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m47s)
02:15:47

[probably only make sense if you listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m50s)
02:15:50

[to a three or four times on the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m51s)
02:15:51

[and then talk about it on the forum yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99NV9Cr75I#t=02h15m53s)
02:15:53
