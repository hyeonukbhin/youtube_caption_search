I'm sure you've noticed but there's been
00:00:03.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m03s

a lot of cool activity on the forum this
00:00:07.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m07s

week and one of the things that's been
00:00:09.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m09s

really great to see is that a lot of you
00:00:10.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m10s

have started creating really helpful
00:00:12.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m12s

materials both for your classmates to
00:00:15.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m15s

better understand stuff and also for you
00:00:18.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m18s

to better understand stuff by trying to
00:00:20.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m20s

teach what you've learned I just wanted
00:00:23.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m23s

to highlight a few i've actually posted
00:00:25.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m25s

to the wiki thread of a few of these but
00:00:29.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m29s

there's there's lots more Russian has
00:00:32.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m32s

posted a whole bunch of nice
00:00:36.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m36s

introductory tutorials so for example if
00:00:38.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m38s

you're having any trouble getting
00:00:41.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m41s

connected with AWS she's got a whole
00:00:42.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m42s

step-by-step how to go about logging in
00:00:46.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m46s

and getting everything working which i
00:00:49.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m49s

think is a really terrific thing and so
00:00:51.629
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m51s

it's a kind of thing that if you are
00:00:53.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m53s

writing some notes for yourself to
00:00:57.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m57s

remind you how to do it
00:00:59.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m59s

you may as well post them for others to
00:01:01.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m01s

do it as well and by using a markdown
00:01:02.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m02s

file like this and it's actually good
00:01:05.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m05s

practice if you haven't used github
00:01:07.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m07s

before if you put it up on github
00:01:08.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m08s

everybody can now use it or of course
00:01:10.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m10s

you can just put it in the forum so more
00:01:13.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m13s

advanced a thing that Reshma wrote up
00:01:17.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m17s

about is she noticed that I like using
00:01:20.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m20s

Tmax which is a handy little thing which
00:01:21.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m21s

lets me lets me basically have a window
00:01:25.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m25s

I'll show you so as soon as I log into
00:01:30.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m30s

my computer if I run Tmax you'll see
00:01:33.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m33s

that all of my windows pop straight up
00:01:38.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m38s

basically and I can like continue
00:01:39.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m39s

running stuff in the background and I
00:01:42.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m42s

can like I've got them over here and I
00:01:44.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m44s

can kind of zoom into it or I can move
00:01:46.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m46s

over to the top which is here so Jupiter
00:01:48.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m48s

colonel running and so forth so if that
00:01:50.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m50s

sounds interesting
00:01:53.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m53s

Reshma has a tutorial here on how you
00:01:54.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m54s

can use two maps and it's actually got a
00:01:57.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m57s

whole bunch of stuff in her github so
00:02:00.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m00s

that's that's really cool I built among
00:02:03.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m03s

has written a very nice kind of summary
00:02:07.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m07s

basically of our last lesson
00:02:10.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m10s

which kind of covers what are the key
00:02:13.689
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m13s

things we did and why did we do them so
00:02:17.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m17s

if you are a kind of
00:02:19.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m19s

wondering like how does it fit together
00:02:21.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m21s

I think this is a really helpful summary
00:02:23.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m23s

like what if those couple of hours look
00:02:25.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m25s

like if we summarize it all into a page
00:02:28.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m28s

or two I also really like Pavel has dad
00:02:30.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m30s

kind of done a deep dive on the learning
00:02:38.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m38s

rate finder which is a topic that a lot
00:02:40.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m40s

of you have been interested in learning
00:02:45.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m45s

more about particularly those of you who
00:02:46.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m46s

have done deep learning before I
00:02:49.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m49s

realized that this is like a solution to
00:02:50.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m50s

a problem that you've been having for a
00:02:52.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m52s

long time and haven't seen before and so
00:02:54.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m54s

it's kind of something which hasn't
00:02:55.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m55s

really been blogged about before so this
00:02:57.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m57s

is the first I've seen it's logged about
00:02:59.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m59s

so when I put this on Twitter a link to
00:03:00.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m00s

pebbles post it's been shared you know
00:03:04.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m04s

hundreds of times it's been really
00:03:06.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m06s

really popular and viewed many thousands
00:03:08.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m08s

of times so that's some great content
00:03:10.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m10s

radec has posted lots of cool stuff I
00:03:13.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m13s

really like this practitioners guide to
00:03:16.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m16s

apply torch which again this is more for
00:03:18.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m18s

more advanced students but it's like
00:03:21.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m21s

digging into people who have never used
00:03:23.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m23s

hi torch before but know a bit about
00:03:25.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m25s

numerical programming in general and
00:03:28.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m28s

it's a quick introduction to how high
00:03:30.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m30s

torch is different and then there's been
00:03:32.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m32s

some interesting little bits of research
00:03:35.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m35s

like what's the relationship between
00:03:36.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m36s

learning rate and batch sites so one of
00:03:38.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m38s

the students actually asked me this
00:03:40.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m40s

before class and I said oh well one of
00:03:42.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m42s

the other students has written an
00:03:44.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m44s

analysis of exactly that so what he's
00:03:46.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m46s

done is basically looked through and
00:03:49.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m49s

tried different batch sizes and
00:03:51.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m51s

different learning rates and tried to
00:03:52.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m52s

see how they seemed to relate together
00:03:54.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m54s

and these are all like cool experiments
00:03:55.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m55s

which you know you can try yourself
00:03:58.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m58s

I predict again he's written something
00:04:00.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m00s

again a kind of a research into this
00:04:04.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m04s

question I made a claim that the the
00:04:05.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m05s

stochastic gradient descent with
00:04:10.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m10s

restarts finds more generalizable parts
00:04:12.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m12s

of the function surface because they're
00:04:14.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m14s

kind of flatter and he's been trying to
00:04:16.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m16s

figure out is there a way to measure
00:04:18.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m18s

that more directly not quite successful
00:04:19.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m19s

yet but a really interesting piece of
00:04:22.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m22s

research got some introductions to
00:04:23.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m23s

convolutional neural networks and then
00:04:27.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m27s

something that we'll be learning about
00:04:32.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m32s

towards the end of this course but I'm
00:04:34.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m34s

sure you've noticed we're using
00:04:36.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m36s

something called ResNet and a nonce aha
00:04:37.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m37s

actually posted a pretty impressive
00:04:40.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m40s

analysis of like watts arrest net and
00:04:43.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m43s

why is it interesting and this one's
00:04:45.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m45s

actually being very already shared very
00:04:47.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m47s

widely around the internet I've seen
00:04:49.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m49s

also so some more advanced students who
00:04:50.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m50s

are interested in jumping ahead can look
00:04:54.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m54s

at that and uphill Tamang also has done
00:04:57.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m57s

something similar so lots of yeah lots
00:05:00.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m00s

of stuff going on on the forums
00:05:04.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m04s

I'm sure you've also noticed we have a
00:05:06.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m06s

beginner forum now specifically for you
00:05:07.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m07s

know asking questions which you know it
00:05:11.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m11s

is always the case that there are no
00:05:15.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m15s

dumb questions but when there's lots of
00:05:17.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m17s

people around you talking about advanced
00:05:19.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m19s

topics it might not feel that way so
00:05:21.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m21s

hopefully the beginners forum is just a
00:05:23.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m23s

less intimidating space and if there are
00:05:25.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m25s

more advanced student who can help
00:05:29.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m29s

answer those questions please do but
00:05:32.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m32s

remember when you do answer those
00:05:34.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m34s

questions try to answer in a way that's
00:05:35.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m35s

friendly to people that maybe you know
00:05:37.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m37s

have no more than a year of programming
00:05:39.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m39s

experience you haven't done any machine
00:05:41.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m41s

learning before so you know I hope other
00:05:42.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m42s

people in the class feel like you can
00:05:50.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m50s

contribute as well and just remember all
00:05:52.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m52s

of the people we just looked at or many
00:05:54.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m54s

of them I believe have never hosted
00:05:56.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m56s

anything to the internet before right I
00:05:58.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m58s

mean you don't have to be a particular
00:06:00.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m00s

kind of person to be allowed to block
00:06:02.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m02s

something you can just jot down your
00:06:04.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m04s

notes throw it up there and one handy
00:06:07.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m07s

thing is if you just put it on the forum
00:06:11.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m11s

and you're not quite sure of some of the
00:06:12.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m12s

details then then you know you have an
00:06:15.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m15s

opportunity to get feedback and say like
00:06:18.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m18s

oh well that's not quite how that works
00:06:20.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m20s

you know actually it works this way
00:06:22.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m22s

instead or oh that's a really
00:06:23.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m23s

interesting insight have you thought
00:06:25.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m25s

about taking this further and so forth
00:06:26.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m26s

so what we've done so far is a kind of
00:06:29.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m29s

an injury an introduction as a just as a
00:06:32.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m32s

practitioner to convolutional neural
00:06:34.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m34s

networks for images and we haven't
00:06:38.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m38s

really talked much at all about
00:06:41.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m41s

the theory or why they work or the math
00:06:43.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m43s

of them but on the other hand what we
00:06:46.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m46s

have done is seen how to build a model
00:06:48.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m48s

which actually works exceptionally well
00:06:52.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m52s

compact world-class level models and
00:06:55.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m55s

we'll kind of review a little bit of
00:06:59.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m59s

that today and then also today we're
00:07:01.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m01s

going to dig in a little quite a lot
00:07:06.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m06s

more actually into the underlying theory
00:07:08.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m08s

of like what is a what is a CNN what's a
00:07:09.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m09s

convolution how does this work and then
00:07:12.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m12s

we're going to kind of go through this
00:07:14.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m14s

this cycle where we're going to dig
00:07:16.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m16s

we're going to do a little intro into a
00:07:18.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m18s

whole bunch of application areas using
00:07:21.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m21s

neural nets for structured data so kind
00:07:23.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m23s

of like logistics or forecasting or you
00:07:25.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m25s

know financial data or that kind of
00:07:29.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m29s

thing and then looking at language
00:07:31.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m31s

applications and LP applications using
00:07:34.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m34s

recurrent neural Nets and then
00:07:36.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m36s

collaborative filtering for
00:07:39.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m39s

recommendations and systems and so these
00:07:42.689
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m42s

will all be like similar to what we've
00:07:45.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m45s

done for cnn's for images would be like
00:07:47.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m47s

here's how you can get a
00:07:50.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m50s

state-of-the-art result without digging
00:07:51.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m51s

into the theory but but knowing how to
00:07:53.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m53s

actually make a work and then we're kind
00:07:55.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m55s

of going to go back through those almost
00:07:57.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m57s

in reverse order so then we're going to
00:08:00.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m00s

dig right into collaborative filtering
00:08:01.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m01s

in a lot of detail and see how how to
00:08:03.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m03s

write the code underneath and how the
00:08:06.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m06s

math works underneath and then we're
00:08:08.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m08s

going to do the same thing for the
00:08:10.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m10s

structured data analysis we're going to
00:08:11.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m11s

do the same thing for comp nets for
00:08:13.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m13s

images and finally an in depth deep dive
00:08:15.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m15s

into apparent neural networks so that's
00:08:18.069
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m18s

kind of where we're okay so let's start
00:08:20.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m20s

by doing a little bit of a review and I
00:08:24.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m24s

want to also provide a bit more detail
00:08:29.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m29s

on some on some steps that we only
00:08:32.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m32s

briefly slipped over so I want to make
00:08:35.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m35s

sure that we're all able to complete
00:08:36.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m36s

kind of last week's assignment which was
00:08:39.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m39s

that the dog breeze I mean to basically
00:08:42.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m42s

apply what you've learned with another
00:08:45.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m45s

data set and I thought the easiest one
00:08:47.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m47s

to do with me the dog breeds cattle
00:08:48.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m48s

competition and so I want to make sure
00:08:50.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m50s

everybody has everything you need to do
00:08:52.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m52s

this right now so and the
00:08:53.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m53s

first thing is to make sure that you
00:08:55.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m55s

know how to download data and so there's
00:08:57.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m57s

there's two main places at the moment
00:09:01.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m01s

we're kind of downloading data from one
00:09:03.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m03s

is from cattle and the other is from
00:09:04.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m04s

like anywhere else and so I'll first of
00:09:07.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m07s

all do the the casual version so to
00:09:11.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m11s

download from cattle we use something
00:09:15.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m15s

called cattle CLI which is gear and to
00:09:18.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m18s

install what I think it's already in the
00:09:24.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m24s

system will shake yeah so it should
00:09:28.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m28s

already be in your environment but to
00:09:34.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m34s

make sure one thing that happens is
00:09:39.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m39s

because this is downloading from the
00:09:41.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m41s

cattle website through experience rating
00:09:42.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m42s

every time cap will change us the
00:09:44.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m44s

website it breaks so anytime you try to
00:09:45.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m45s

use it and if the cattles websites
00:09:48.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m48s

changed recent when you'll need to make
00:09:51.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m51s

sure you get the most recent version so
00:09:53.279
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m53s

you can always go to pip install cable -
00:09:55.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m55s

CL I - - upgrade and so that'll just
00:10:00.379
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m00s

make sure that you've got the latest
00:10:06.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m06s

version of of it and everything that it
00:10:07.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m07s

depends on okay and so then having done
00:10:10.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m10s

that you can follow the instructions
00:10:14.009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m14s

actually I think Reshma was kind enough
00:10:16.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m16s

to they go there's a cable CLI you know
00:10:18.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m18s

like everything you need to know can be
00:10:21.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m21s

under Reshma's github so basically to do
00:10:22.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m22s

that at the next step you go kg download
00:10:29.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m29s

and then you provide your username with
00:10:35.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m35s

- you you provide your password with - P
00:10:37.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m37s

and then - see it the competition name
00:10:41.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m41s

and a lot of people in the forum is
00:10:44.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m44s

being confused about what to enter here
00:10:46.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m46s

and so the key thing to note is that
00:10:47.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m47s

when you're at a capital competition
00:10:49.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m49s

after the /c there's a specific name
00:10:51.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m51s

planet - understanding - etcetera right
00:10:55.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m55s

that's the name you need okay the other
00:10:58.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m58s

thing you'll need to make sure is that
00:11:02.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m02s

you've on your own computer have
00:11:03.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m03s

attempted to click download at least
00:11:06.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m06s

once because when you do
00:11:08.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m08s

ask you to accept the rules if you've
00:11:09.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m09s

forgotten to do that kg download will
00:11:12.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m12s

give you a hint it'll say oh it looks
00:11:15.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m15s

like you might have forgotten the rules
00:11:17.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m17s

if you log into cattle with like a
00:11:18.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m18s

Google account like anything other than
00:11:21.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m21s

a username password this won't work so
00:11:24.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m24s

you'll need to click forgot password on
00:11:26.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m26s

Kaggle and get them to send you a normal
00:11:28.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m28s

password so that's the cattle version
00:11:30.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m30s

right and so when you do that you end up
00:11:33.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m33s

with a whole folder created for you with
00:11:36.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m36s

all of that competition and data in it
00:11:38.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m38s

so a couple of reasons you might want to
00:11:41.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m41s

not use that the first years that you're
00:11:44.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m44s

using a data set that's not on cattle
00:11:46.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m46s

the second is that you don't want all of
00:11:48.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m48s

the data sets in a cattle competition
00:11:50.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m50s

for example the planet competition that
00:11:52.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m52s

we've been looking at a little bit we'll
00:11:55.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m55s

look at again today has data in two
00:11:56.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m56s

formats TIFF and JPEG the TIFF is 19
00:12:00.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m00s

gigabytes and the JPEG is 600 megabytes
00:12:03.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m03s

so you probably don't want to download
00:12:06.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m06s

both so I'll show you a really cool kit
00:12:08.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m08s

which actually somebody on the forum
00:12:11.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m11s

taught me I think was one of the young
00:12:13.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m13s

MSN students here at USF there's a
00:12:14.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m14s

Chrome extension cord curl W get so you
00:12:18.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m18s

can just search for a curl W get and
00:12:24.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m24s

then you install it by just clicking on
00:12:27.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m27s

installed and having an extension before
00:12:29.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m29s

and then from now on every time you try
00:12:31.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m31s

to download something so I'll try and
00:12:35.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m35s

download this file
00:12:36.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m36s

and I'll just go ahead and cancel it
00:12:40.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m40s

right and now you see this little yellow
00:12:42.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m42s

button that's added up here there's a
00:12:45.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m45s

whole command here right so I can copy
00:12:47.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m47s

that and paste it into my window and hit
00:12:51.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m51s

go and it's there cuz okay so what that
00:12:59.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m59s

does is like all of your cookies and
00:13:03.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m03s

headers and everything else needed to
00:13:06.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m06s

download that file is like say so this
00:13:08.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m08s

is not just useful for downloading data
00:13:10.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m10s

it's also useful if you like trying to
00:13:13.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m13s

download some I don't know TV show or
00:13:16.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m16s

something anything where you're it's
00:13:18.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m18s

hidden behind a login or something you
00:13:19.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m19s

can you can grab it and actually that is
00:13:23.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m23s

very useful for data science because
00:13:25.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m25s

quite often we want to analyze things
00:13:26.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m26s

like videos on our on our consoles so
00:13:28.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m28s

this is a good trick alright so there's
00:13:31.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m31s

two ways to get the data so then having
00:13:33.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m33s

got the data you then need to build your
00:13:40.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m40s

model right so what I tend to do like
00:13:44.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m44s

you'll notice that I tend to assume that
00:13:47.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m47s

the data is in a directory called data
00:13:49.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m49s

that's a subdirectory of wherever your
00:13:51.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m51s

notebook is right now you don't
00:13:54.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m54s

necessarily actually want to put your
00:13:57.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m57s

data there you might want to put it
00:14:00.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m00s

directly in your home directory or you
00:14:01.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m01s

might wanna put it on another drive or
00:14:03.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m03s

whatever so what I do is if you look
00:14:04.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m04s

inside my courses do one folder you'll
00:14:07.959
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m07s

see that data is actually a symbolic
00:14:11.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m11s

link to a different drive alright so you
00:14:14.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m14s

can put it anywhere you like and then
00:14:17.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m17s

you can just add a symbolic link or you
00:14:19.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m19s

can just put it there directly it's up
00:14:22.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m22s

to you if you haven't used symlinks
00:14:24.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m24s

before they're like aliases or shortcuts
00:14:26.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m26s

on the mac or windows very handy and
00:14:28.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m28s

there's some threads on the forum about
00:14:32.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m32s

how to use them if you want help with
00:14:33.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m33s

that that for example is also how we
00:14:35.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m35s

actually have the fast AI modules
00:14:38.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m38s

available from the same place as our
00:14:41.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m41s

notebooks it's just a symlink
00:14:43.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m43s

to where they come from anytime you want
00:14:45.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m45s

to see like where things actually point
00:14:48.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m48s

to in Linux you can just use the
00:14:51.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m51s

- L flag - listing a directory and
00:14:54.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m54s

that'll show you where the symlinks
00:14:57.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m57s

exist still lost I'll show you which
00:14:59.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m59s

scenes the directories so forth okay so
00:15:01.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m01s

one thing which may be a little unclear
00:15:05.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m05s

based on what we've done so far is like
00:15:12.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m12s

how little code you actually need to do
00:15:14.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m14s

this end to it so what I've got here is
00:15:17.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m17s

is in a single window is an entire
00:15:20.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m20s

end-to-end process to get a
00:15:22.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m22s

state-of-the-art result put cats versus
00:15:25.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m25s

dogs all right I've only step I've
00:15:27.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m27s

skipped is the bit where we've
00:15:30.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m30s

downloaded it from title and then where
00:15:31.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m31s

we unzip it all right so these are
00:15:33.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m33s

literally all the steps and so we import
00:15:37.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m37s

our libraries and actually if you import
00:15:43.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m43s

this one Kampf loner that basically
00:15:45.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m45s

imports everything else so that's that
00:15:47.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m47s

we need to tell at the path of where
00:15:51.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m51s

things are the size that we want the
00:15:53.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m53s

batch size that we want right so then
00:15:55.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m55s

and we're going to learn a lot more
00:15:59.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m59s

about what these do very shortly but
00:16:00.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m00s

basically we say how do we want to
00:16:02.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m02s

transform our data so we want to
00:16:04.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m04s

transform it in a way that's suitable to
00:16:06.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m06s

this particular kind of model and it
00:16:08.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m08s

assumes that the photos aside on photos
00:16:10.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m10s

and that we're going to zoom in up to
00:16:13.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m13s

ten percent each time we say that we
00:16:15.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m15s

want to get some data based on paths and
00:16:18.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m18s

so remember this is this idea that
00:16:21.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m21s

there's a path called cats and the path
00:16:23.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m23s

called dogs and they're inside a path
00:16:24.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m24s

called train and a path called valid
00:16:26.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m26s

note that you can always overwrite these
00:16:28.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m28s

with other things so if your things are
00:16:34.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m34s

in different folders
00:16:36.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m36s

you could either rename them or you can
00:16:37.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m37s

see here there's like a train name and a
00:16:39.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m39s

bowel name you can always pick something
00:16:42.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m42s

else here also notice there's a test
00:16:44.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m44s

name so if you want to submit some into
00:16:48.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m48s

cattle you'll need to fill in the name
00:16:51.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m51s

the name of the folder where the test
00:16:52.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m52s

sentence and obviously those those won't
00:16:54.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m54s

be labeled
00:16:56.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m56s

so then we create a model from a
00:16:59.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m59s

pre-training model it's from a resonant
00:17:02.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m02s

50 model using this data and then we
00:17:04.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m04s

call fit and remember by default that
00:17:08.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m08s

has all of the layers but the last few
00:17:11.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m11s

frozen and again we'll learn a lot more
00:17:13.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m13s

about what that means
00:17:15.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m15s

and so that's that's what that does so
00:17:17.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m17s

that that took two and a half minutes
00:17:19.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m19s

notice here I didn't say pre-compute
00:17:23.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m23s

equals true again there's been some
00:17:26.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m26s

confusion on the forums about like what
00:17:27.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m27s

that means it's only a is only something
00:17:29.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m29s

that makes it a little faster for this
00:17:33.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m33s

first step right so you can always skip
00:17:35.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m35s

it and if you're at all confused about
00:17:37.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m37s

it or it's causing you any problems just
00:17:39.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m39s

leave it off right because it's just a
00:17:41.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m41s

it's just a shortcut which caches some
00:17:45.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m45s

of the intermediate steps that don't
00:17:48.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m48s

have to be recalculating each time and
00:17:50.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m50s

remember that when we are using pre
00:17:52.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m52s

computed activations data or
00:17:54.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m54s

augmentation doesn't work right so even
00:17:56.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m56s

if you ask for a data augmentation if
00:17:59.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m59s

you've got pre compute equals true it
00:18:01.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m01s

doesn't actually do any data
00:18:04.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m04s

augmentation because it's using the
00:18:05.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m05s

cached non augmented activations so in
00:18:06.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m06s

this case to keep this as simple as
00:18:11.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m11s

possible I have no pre computed anything
00:18:12.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m12s

going on so I do three cycles of length
00:18:14.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m14s

one and then I can then unfreeze so it's
00:18:17.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m17s

now going to train the whole thing
00:18:24.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m24s

something we haven't seen before and
00:18:25.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m25s

we'll learn about in the second half is
00:18:27.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m27s

called B and freeze for now all you need
00:18:30.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m30s

to know is that if you're using a model
00:18:33.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m33s

like a bigger deeper model like ResNet
00:18:36.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m36s

50 or rez next 101 on a data set that's
00:18:39.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m39s

very very similar to imagenet like these
00:18:42.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m42s

cat sandbox data set sort of words it's
00:18:46.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m46s

like sidon photos of standard objects
00:18:48.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m48s

you know of a similar size to image turn
00:18:51.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m51s

and money somewhere between 200 and 500
00:18:54.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m54s

pixels
00:18:56.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m56s

you should probably add this line when
00:18:57.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m57s

you unfreeze for those of you that are
00:19:01.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m01s

more advanced what it's doing is it's
00:19:03.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m03s

causing the batch normalization moving
00:19:06.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m06s

averages to not be updated
00:19:09.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m09s

but in the second half of this course
00:19:10.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m10s

we're gonna learn all about why we do
00:19:12.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m12s

that it's something that's not supported
00:19:14.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m14s

by any other library but it turns out to
00:19:15.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m15s

be super important anyway so we do one
00:19:18.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m18s

more
00:19:20.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m20s

epoch with training the whole network
00:19:21.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m21s

and then at the end we use test time
00:19:26.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m26s

augmentation to ensure that we get the
00:19:28.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m28s

best predictions we can and that gives
00:19:31.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m31s

us ninety nine point four five percent
00:19:34.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m34s

so that's that's it right so when you
00:19:37.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m37s

try a new data set they're basically the
00:19:41.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m41s

minimum set of steps that you would need
00:19:44.649
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m44s

to follow you'll notice this is assuming
00:19:47.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m47s

I already know what learning wrote to
00:19:49.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m49s

use so you'd use the learning rate
00:19:51.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m51s

finder for that it's assuming that I
00:19:53.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m53s

know that the directory layout and so
00:19:56.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m56s

forth so that's kind of a minimum set
00:19:59.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m59s

now one of the things that I wanted to
00:20:02.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m02s

make sure you had an understanding of
00:20:04.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m04s

how to do is how to use other libraries
00:20:07.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m07s

other than fast AI and so I feel like
00:20:10.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m10s

the best thing to to look at is to look
00:20:12.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m12s

at care us because care us is a library
00:20:15.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m15s

just like fast AI sits on top of pi
00:20:18.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m18s

torch care us sits on top of actually a
00:20:20.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m20s

whole variety of different backends it
00:20:23.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m23s

fits mainly people nowadays use it with
00:20:25.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m25s

tensorflow
00:20:28.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m28s

there's also an MX net version there's
00:20:28.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m28s

also a Microsoft CNT K version so what
00:20:32.259
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m32s

I've got if you do a git pull you'll see
00:20:37.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m37s

that there's a something called care us
00:20:39.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m39s

less than one where I've attempted to
00:20:43.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m43s

replicate at least parts of lesson one
00:20:46.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m46s

in care us just to give you a sense of
00:20:48.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m48s

how that works I'm not going to talk
00:20:52.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m52s

more about batch two norm freeze now
00:20:59.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m59s

other than to say if you're using
00:21:00.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m00s

something which has got a number larger
00:21:04.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m04s

than 34 at the end
00:21:07.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m07s

so like ResNet 50 or res next 101 and
00:21:09.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m09s

you're trading a data set that has that
00:21:11.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m11s

is very similar to image net so it's
00:21:16.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m16s

like normal photos of normal sizes where
00:21:18.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m18s

the thing of interest takes up most of
00:21:20.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m20s

the frame then you probably should
00:21:22.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m22s

at the end fries true after unfreeze
00:21:24.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m24s

if in doubt try trading it with and then
00:21:27.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m27s

try trading it without more advanced
00:21:30.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m30s

students will certainly talk about it on
00:21:33.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m33s

the forums this week and we will be
00:21:35.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m35s

talking about the details of it in the
00:21:37.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m37s

second half of the course when we come
00:21:39.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m39s

back to our CNN in death section in the
00:21:41.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m41s

second last lesson so with care us again
00:21:46.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m46s

we import a bunch of stuff and remember
00:21:55.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m55s

I mentioned that this idea that you've
00:22:01.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m01s

got a thing called train and a thing
00:22:03.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m03s

called valid and inside that you've got
00:22:04.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m04s

a thing called dogs and things called
00:22:06.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m06s

cats is a standard way of providing
00:22:07.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m07s

image labelled images so Karis does that
00:22:10.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m10s

too right so it's going to tell it where
00:22:14.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m14s

the training set and the validation set
00:22:16.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m16s

are twice what batch size to used now
00:22:18.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m18s

you'll notice in Karis we need much much
00:22:24.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m24s

much more code to do the same thing more
00:22:27.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m27s

importantly each part of that code has
00:22:32.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m32s

many many many more things you have to
00:22:34.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m34s

set and if you set them wrong everything
00:22:36.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m36s

breaks right so I'll give you a summary
00:22:38.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m38s

of what they are
00:22:43.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m43s

so you're basically rather than creating
00:22:44.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m44s

a single data object in chaos we first
00:22:47.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m47s

of all have to define something called a
00:22:51.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m51s

data generator to say kind of generate
00:22:52.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m52s

the data and so a data generator we
00:22:55.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m55s

basically have to say what kind of data
00:22:57.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m57s

augmentation we want to do and we also
00:23:00.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m00s

we actually have to say what kind of
00:23:04.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m04s

normalization do we want to do
00:23:08.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m08s

so we're else with fast AI we just say
00:23:11.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m11s

whatever ResNet 50 requires just do that
00:23:13.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m13s

for me please we actually have to kind
00:23:16.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m16s

of know a little bit about what's
00:23:18.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m18s

expected of us
00:23:19.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m19s

generally speaking copying and pasting
00:23:21.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m21s

cos code from the internet is a good way
00:23:23.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m23s

to make sure you've got the right the
00:23:25.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m25s

right stuff to make that work and again
00:23:27.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m27s

it doesn't have a kind of a standard set
00:23:30.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m30s

of like here the best data augmentation
00:23:32.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m32s

parameters to use for photos so you know
00:23:34.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m34s

I've copied and pasted all of this from
00:23:37.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m37s

the Kaos documentation so I don't know
00:23:39.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m39s

if it's I don't think it's the best set
00:23:43.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m43s

to use it all but it's the set that
00:23:45.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m45s

they're using in their docks so having
00:23:46.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m46s

said this is how I want to generate data
00:23:49.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m49s

so horizontally fit sometimes you know
00:23:51.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m51s

zoom sometimes sheer sometimes we then
00:23:53.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m53s

create a generator from that by taking
00:23:56.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m56s

that data generator and saying I want to
00:23:59.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m59s

generate images by looking from a
00:24:01.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m01s

directory we pass in the directory which
00:24:04.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m04s

is of the same directory structure that
00:24:07.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m07s

fast AI users and you'll see there's
00:24:09.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m09s

some overlaps with kind of how fast AI
00:24:12.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m12s

works here you tell it what size images
00:24:14.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m14s

you want to create you tell at what
00:24:16.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m16s

batch size you want in your mini batches
00:24:18.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m18s

and then there's something you not to
00:24:19.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m19s

worry about too much but basically if
00:24:22.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m22s

you're just got two possible outcomes
00:24:24.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m24s

you would generally say binary here if
00:24:26.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m26s

you've got multiple possible outcomes
00:24:28.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m28s

would say categorical yeah so we've only
00:24:29.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m29s

got cats or dogs
00:24:32.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m32s

so it's binary so an example of like
00:24:33.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m33s

where things get a little more complex
00:24:37.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m37s

is you have to do the same thing for the
00:24:39.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m39s

validation set so it's up to you to
00:24:41.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m41s

create a data generator that doesn't
00:24:43.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m43s

have data augmentation because obviously
00:24:45.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m45s

for the validation set unless you're
00:24:47.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m47s

using t/ta that's going to start things
00:24:49.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m49s

up you also when you train you randomly
00:24:51.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m51s

reorder the images so that they're
00:24:57.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m57s

always shown in different orders to make
00:24:59.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m59s

it more random but with a validation
00:25:01.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m01s

it's vital that you don't do that
00:25:03.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m03s

because if you shuffle the validation
00:25:06.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m06s

set you then can't track how well you're
00:25:07.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m07s

doing it's in a different order for the
00:25:09.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m09s

labels
00:25:11.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m11s

that's a basically these are the kind of
00:25:11.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m11s

steps you have to do every time with
00:25:14.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m14s

care us so again the reason I was using
00:25:17.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m17s

ResNet 50 before is chaos doesn't have
00:25:22.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m22s

ResNet 34 unfortunately so I just wanted
00:25:24.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m24s

to compare like with Mike so we're going
00:25:26.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m26s

to use resident 50 here there isn't the
00:25:28.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m28s

same idea with chaos of saying like
00:25:32.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m32s

constructor model that is suitable for
00:25:34.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m34s

this data set for me so you have to do
00:25:37.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m37s

it by hand right so the way you do it is
00:25:39.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m39s

to basically say this is my base model
00:25:42.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m42s

and then you have to construct on top of
00:25:44.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m44s

that manually the layers that you want
00:25:47.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m47s

to add
00:25:50.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m50s

and so by the end of this course you'll
00:25:50.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m50s

understand a way it is that these
00:25:52.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m52s

particular three layers other layers
00:25:53.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m53s

that we add so having done that in chaos
00:25:56.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m56s

you basically say okay this is my model
00:26:01.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m01s

and then again there isn't like a
00:26:03.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m03s

concept to it like automatically
00:26:06.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m06s

freezing things or an API for that so
00:26:08.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m08s

you just have to allow look through the
00:26:10.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m10s

layers that you want to freeze and call
00:26:13.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m13s

dot trainable equals false on them in
00:26:16.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m16s

Karis there's a concept we don't have in
00:26:20.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m20s

fast AI or play a torch of compiling a
00:26:22.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m22s

model so basically once your model is
00:26:25.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m25s

ready to use you have to compile it
00:26:27.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m27s

passing in what kind of optimizer to use
00:26:28.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m28s

what kind of loss to look for about
00:26:32.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m32s

metric so again with fast AI you don't
00:26:33.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m33s

have to pass this in because we know
00:26:37.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m37s

what loss is the write loss to use you
00:26:38.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m38s

can always override it but for a
00:26:41.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m41s

particular model we give you good
00:26:43.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m43s

defaults okay so having done all that
00:26:44.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m44s

rather than calling fit you call
00:26:48.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m48s

generator passing in those two
00:26:50.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m50s

generators that you saw earlier the
00:26:53.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m53s

Train generator in the validation
00:26:54.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m54s

generator for reasons I don't quite
00:26:55.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m55s

understand chaos expects you to also
00:26:59.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m59s

tell it how many batches there are per
00:27:01.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m01s

epoch so the number of batches is a
00:27:03.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m03s

quarter the size of the generator
00:27:06.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m06s

divided by the batch size you can tell
00:27:08.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m08s

it how many epochs just like in fast AI
00:27:11.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m11s

you can say how many processes or how
00:27:16.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m16s

many workers to use for pre-processing
00:27:18.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m18s

[Music]
00:27:21.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m21s

unlike fast AI the default in chaos is
00:27:23.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m23s

basically not to use any so to get good
00:27:26.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m26s

speed you're going to make sure you
00:27:30.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m30s

include this and so that's basically
00:27:32.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m32s

enough to start fine tuning the last
00:27:35.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m35s

layers so as you can see I got to a
00:27:39.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m39s

validation accuracy of 95% but as you
00:27:44.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m44s

can also see something really weird
00:27:47.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m47s

happened we're after one it was like 49
00:27:48.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m48s

and then it was 69 and then 95 I don't
00:27:50.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m50s

know why these are so low that's not
00:27:53.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m53s

normal
00:27:56.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m56s

I may have there may be a bug and chaos
00:27:58.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m58s

they may be a bug in my code I reached
00:28:00.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m00s

out on Twitter to see if
00:28:03.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m03s

anybody could figure it out but they
00:28:04.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m04s

couldn't I guess this is one of the
00:28:05.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m05s

challenges with using something like
00:28:07.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m07s

this is one of the reasons I wanted to
00:28:09.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m09s

use fast AI for this course is it's much
00:28:11.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m11s

harder to screw things up so I don't
00:28:13.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m13s

know if I screwed something up or
00:28:16.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m16s

somebody else did
00:28:17.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m17s

yes you know this is you've seen the
00:28:18.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m18s

chance to float back end yeah yeah and
00:28:23.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m23s

if you want to run this to try it out
00:28:25.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m25s

yourself you just can just go pip
00:28:28.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m28s

install tensorflow - GPU Kerris okay
00:28:31.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m31s

because it's not part of the faster I
00:28:39.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m39s

environment by default but that should
00:28:40.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m40s

be all you need to do to get that
00:28:45.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m45s

working so then there isn't a concept of
00:28:47.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m47s

like layer groups or differential
00:28:55.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m55s

learning rates or partial unfreezing or
00:28:58.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m58s

whatever so you have to decide like I
00:29:00.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m00s

had to print out all of the layers and
00:29:02.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m02s

decide manually how many I wanted to
00:29:03.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m03s

fine-tune so I decided to fine-tune
00:29:06.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m06s

everything from a layer 140 onwards so
00:29:08.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m08s

that's why I just looked through like
00:29:10.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m10s

this after you change that you have to
00:29:11.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m11s

recompile the model and then after that
00:29:14.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m14s

I then ran another step and again I
00:29:17.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m17s

don't know what happened here the
00:29:19.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m19s

accuracy of the training set stayed
00:29:20.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m20s

about the same but the validation set
00:29:22.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m22s

totally fill in the hole and I mean the
00:29:24.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m24s

main thing to notice even if we put
00:29:27.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m27s

aside the validation set we're getting I
00:29:29.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m29s

mean I guess the main thing is there's a
00:29:33.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m33s

hell of a lot more code here which is
00:29:35.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m35s

kind of annoying but also the
00:29:36.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m36s

performance is very different so where
00:29:39.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m39s

else is here even on the training set
00:29:40.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m40s

we're getting like 97% after four epochs
00:29:42.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m42s

that took a total of about eight minutes
00:29:46.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m46s

you know over here we had 99.5% on the
00:29:48.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m48s

validation set and it ran a lot faster
00:29:53.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m53s

so I was like four or five minutes right
00:29:57.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m57s

so
00:30:02.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m02s

depending on what you do particularly if
00:30:06.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m06s

you end up wanting to deploy stuff to
00:30:09.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m09s

mobile devices at the moment the kind of
00:30:10.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m10s

PI torch on mobile situation is very
00:30:14.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m14s

early so you may find yourself wanting
00:30:17.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m17s

to use tensorflow or you may work for a
00:30:19.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m19s

company that's kind of settled on
00:30:21.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m21s

tensorflow so if you need to convert
00:30:23.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m23s

something like redo something you've
00:30:27.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m27s

learnt here intensive flow you probably
00:30:29.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m29s

want to do it with care us but just
00:30:31.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m31s

recognize you know it's got to take a
00:30:34.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m34s

bit more work to get there and by
00:30:37.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m37s

default it's much harder to get I mean I
00:30:40.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m40s

to get the same state of the out results
00:30:43.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m43s

you get the faster I you'd have to like
00:30:45.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m45s

replicate all of the state-of-the-art
00:30:46.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m46s

algorithms that are in first a nice so
00:30:49.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m49s

it's hard to get the same level of
00:30:52.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m52s

results but you can see the basic ideas
00:30:54.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m54s

are similar okay and it's certainly it's
00:30:57.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m57s

certainly possible you know like there's
00:31:01.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m01s

nothing I'm doing in fast AI that like
00:31:03.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m03s

would be impossible but like you'd have
00:31:05.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m05s

to implement stochastic gradient percent
00:31:08.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m08s

with restarts you would have to
00:31:09.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m09s

implement differential learning rates
00:31:11.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m11s

you would have to implement batch norm
00:31:14.169
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m14s

freezing which you probably don't want
00:31:16.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m16s

to do I know and well that's not quite
00:31:18.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m18s

true I think somewhat one person at
00:31:20.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m20s

least on the forum is attempting to
00:31:22.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m22s

create a chaos compatible version of or
00:31:24.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m24s

a tensorflow compatible version of fast
00:31:26.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m26s

AI which I think I hope will get there I
00:31:28.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m28s

actually spoke to Google about this a
00:31:30.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m30s

few weeks ago and they're very
00:31:32.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m32s

interested in getting faster i ported to
00:31:33.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m33s

tensorflow so maybe by the time you're
00:31:36.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m36s

looking at this on the mooc maybe that
00:31:38.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m38s

will exist I certainly hope so we will
00:31:40.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m40s

see hey wait
00:31:43.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m43s

so Karis is Karis intensive flow was
00:31:46.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m46s

certainly not you know
00:31:49.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m49s

that difficult to handle and so I don't
00:31:53.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m53s

think you should worry if you're told
00:31:55.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m55s

you have to learn them after this course
00:31:56.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m56s

for some reason even let me take you a
00:31:59.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h31m59s

couple of days I'm sure so that's kind
00:32:00.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m00s

of most of the stuff you would need to
00:32:08.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m08s

kind of complete this this kind of
00:32:11.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m11s

assignment from last week which was like
00:32:13.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m13s

try to do everything you've seen already
00:32:15.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m15s

but on the dog of reinstated said just
00:32:17.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m17s

to remind you that kind of last few
00:32:19.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m19s

minutes of last week's lesson I show you
00:32:23.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m23s

how to do much of that including like
00:32:26.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m26s

how I actually explored the data to find
00:32:30.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m30s

out like what the classes were and how
00:32:32.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m32s

big the images were and stuff like that
00:32:35.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m35s

right so if you've forgotten that or
00:32:38.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m38s

didn't quite follow at all last week
00:32:39.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m39s

check out the video from last week to
00:32:42.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m42s

see one thing that we didn't talk about
00:32:44.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m44s

is how do you actually submit to Carol
00:32:47.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m47s

so how do you actually get predictions
00:32:49.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m49s

so I just wanted to show you that last
00:32:51.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m51s

piece as well and on the wiki thread
00:32:53.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m53s

this week I've already put a little
00:32:56.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m56s

image of this to show you these days but
00:32:58.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m58s

if you go to the kaggle website for
00:33:01.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m01s

every competition there's a section
00:33:04.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m04s

called evaluation and they tell you what
00:33:06.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m06s

it's a bit and so I just copied and
00:33:08.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m08s

pasted these two lines from from there
00:33:10.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m10s

and so it says we're expected to submit
00:33:13.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m13s

a file where the first line contains the
00:33:15.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m15s

the work the word ID and then a comma
00:33:18.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m18s

separated list of all of the possible
00:33:22.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m22s

dog breeds and then every line after
00:33:23.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m23s

that will contain the idea itself
00:33:26.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m26s

followed by all the probabilities of all
00:33:29.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m29s

the different dog breeds so how do you
00:33:31.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m31s

create that so recognize that inside our
00:33:35.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m35s

data object there's a dot classes which
00:33:39.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m39s

has got in alphabetical order all of the
00:33:42.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m42s

four other classes and then so it's got
00:33:46.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m46s

all of the different classes and then
00:33:52.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m52s

inside data dot test data set just yes
00:33:53.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m53s

you can also see there's all the file
00:33:58.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m58s

names so and just to remind you dogs and
00:34:00.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m00s

cats
00:34:05.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m05s

sorry
00:34:05.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m05s

cats dog breeds was not provided in the
00:34:06.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m06s

kind of care our style format where the
00:34:11.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m11s

dogs and cats from different folders but
00:34:13.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m13s

instead it was provided as a CSV file of
00:34:15.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m15s

labels right so when you get a CSV file
00:34:18.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m18s

of labels you use image classifier data
00:34:21.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m21s

from CSV rather than image classifier
00:34:25.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m25s

data from parts there isn't an
00:34:27.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m27s

equivalent in care us so you'll see like
00:34:31.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m31s

on the cattle forums people share
00:34:33.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m33s

scripts for how to convert it to a care
00:34:36.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m36s

our style folders but in our case we
00:34:38.129
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m38s

don't have to we just go image
00:34:40.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m40s

classifier data from CSV passing in that
00:34:41.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m41s

CSV file and so the CSV file will you
00:34:44.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m44s

know has automatically told the data you
00:34:49.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m49s

know what the masses are and then also
00:34:51.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m51s

we can see from the folder of test
00:34:54.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m54s

images what the file names of those are
00:34:57.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m57s

so with those two pieces of information
00:35:00.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m00s

we're ready to go so I always think it's
00:35:03.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m03s

a good idea to use TTA as you saw with
00:35:07.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m07s

that dogs and cats example just now it
00:35:09.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m09s

can really improve things particularly
00:35:11.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m11s

when your model is less good so I can
00:35:13.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m13s

say learn dot t ta and if you pass in
00:35:17.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m17s

yeah if you pass in is test equals true
00:35:25.549
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m25s

then it's going to give you predictions
00:35:29.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m29s

on the test set rather than the
00:35:32.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m32s

validation set okay
00:35:33.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m33s

and now obviously we can't now get an
00:35:35.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m35s

accuracy or anything because by
00:35:39.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m39s

definition we don't know the labels for
00:35:40.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m40s

the test set right so by default most
00:35:42.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m42s

high-touch models give you back the log
00:35:48.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m48s

of the predictions so then we just have
00:35:51.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m51s

to go X of that to get back out
00:35:54.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m54s

probabilities so in this case the test
00:35:57.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m57s

set had ten thousand three hundred and
00:35:59.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m59s

fifty seven images in it and there are
00:36:01.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m01s

120 possible breeds all right so we get
00:36:03.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m03s

back a matrix of of that size and so we
00:36:06.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m06s

now need to turn that into something
00:36:10.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m10s

that looks like this
00:36:12.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m12s

and so the easiest way to do that is
00:36:16.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m16s

with pandas if you're not familiar with
00:36:17.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m17s

pandas there's lots of information
00:36:19.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m19s

online about it or check out the machine
00:36:21.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m21s

learning course intro to machine
00:36:23.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m23s

learning that we have where we do lots
00:36:24.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m24s

of stuff with pandas but basically we
00:36:26.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m26s

can describe PD data frame and pass in
00:36:28.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m28s

that matrix and then we can say the
00:36:30.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m30s

names of the columns are equal to data
00:36:33.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m33s

duck classes and then finally we can
00:36:36.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m36s

insert a new column at position 0 called
00:36:38.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m38s

ID that contains the file names but
00:36:41.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m41s

you'll notice that the file names
00:36:45.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m45s

contain five letters at the end I start
00:36:47.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m47s

we don't want and four letters at the
00:36:51.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m51s

end we don't want so I just subset in
00:36:52.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m52s

like so right so at that point I've got
00:36:56.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m56s

a data frame that looks like this which
00:37:02.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m02s

is what we want so you can now call a
00:37:06.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m06s

data frame data so social cues dated DF
00:37:10.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m10s

not des let's fix it now data frame okay
00:37:13.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m13s

so you can now call data frame to CSV
00:37:24.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m24s

and quite often you'll find these files
00:37:26.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m26s

actually get quite big so it's a good
00:37:30.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m30s

idea to say compression equals gzip and
00:37:33.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m33s

that'll zip it up on the server for you
00:37:35.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m35s

and that's going to create a zipped up
00:37:37.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m37s

CSV file on the server on wherever
00:37:41.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m41s

you're running is Jupiter notebook so
00:37:44.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m44s

you need apps that you now need to get
00:37:46.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m46s

that back to your computer so you can
00:37:47.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m47s

upload it or you can use carol CLA so
00:37:49.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m49s

you can type kgs submit and do it that
00:37:53.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m53s

way
00:37:55.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m55s

I generally download it to my computer
00:37:55.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m55s

so like how often back to this lab
00:37:58.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m58s

double check it all looks ok so to do
00:38:00.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m00s

that there's a cool little theme called
00:38:04.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m04s

file link and if you run file link with
00:38:05.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m05s

a path on your server it gives you back
00:38:09.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m09s

a URL which you can click on and it will
00:38:11.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m11s

download that file from the server onto
00:38:14.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m14s

your computer so if I click on that now
00:38:18.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m18s

I can go ahead and save it
00:38:21.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m21s

and then I can see in my downloads
00:38:25.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m25s

there it is here's my submission file
00:38:33.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m33s

they want to open their yeah and as you
00:38:40.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m40s

can see it's exactly what I asked for
00:38:44.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m44s

there's my ID and 120 different dog
00:38:45.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m45s

breeds and then here's my first row
00:38:49.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m49s

containing the file name and the 120
00:38:51.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m51s

different probabilities okay so then you
00:38:54.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m54s

can go ahead and submit that to cattle
00:38:56.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m56s

through their through their regular form
00:38:58.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m58s

and so this is also a good way you can
00:39:00.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m00s

see we've now got a good way of both
00:39:03.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m03s

grabbing any file off the internet and
00:39:05.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m05s

getting a to our AWS instance or paper
00:39:08.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m08s

space or whatever by using the cool
00:39:10.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m10s

little extension in chrome and we've
00:39:15.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m15s

also got a way of grabbing stuff off our
00:39:17.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m17s

server easily those of you that are more
00:39:18.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m18s

command line oriented you can also use
00:39:22.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m22s

SCP of course but I kind of like doing
00:39:24.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m24s

everything through the notebook all
00:39:28.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m28s

right
00:39:31.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m31s

one other question I had during the week
00:39:32.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m32s

was like what if I want to just get a
00:39:34.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m34s

single a single file that I want to you
00:39:37.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m37s

know get a prediction for so for example
00:39:42.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m42s

you know maybe I want to get this first
00:39:45.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m45s

file from my validation set
00:39:47.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m47s

so there's its name so you can always
00:39:49.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m49s

look at a file just by calling image dot
00:39:52.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m52s

open that just uses regular - imaging
00:39:54.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m54s

library and so what you can do is
00:39:59.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m59s

there's actually I'll show you the
00:40:04.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m04s

shortest version you can just call learn
00:40:05.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m05s

predict array passing in your your image
00:40:09.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m09s

okay now the image needs to have been
00:40:16.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m16s

transformed
00:40:20.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m20s

so you've seen transform Trent
00:40:21.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m21s

transforms from model before normally we
00:40:24.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m24s

just put put it all in one variable but
00:40:27.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m27s

actually behind the scenes it was
00:40:29.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m29s

returning to things
00:40:31.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m31s

it was returning training transforms and
00:40:32.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m32s

validation transforms so I can actually
00:40:34.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m34s

split them apart and so here you can see
00:40:36.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m36s

I'm actually applying example my
00:40:38.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m38s

training transforms or probably more
00:40:41.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m41s

likely that would apply validation
00:40:43.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m43s

transforms that gives me back an array
00:40:45.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m45s

containing the image the transformed
00:40:48.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m48s

image which I can then past
00:40:51.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m51s

everything that gets passed to or
00:40:55.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m55s

returned from bottles is generally
00:40:58.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m58s

assumed to be a mini batch right it's
00:41:01.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m01s

generally assumed to be a bunch of
00:41:03.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m03s

images so we'll talk more about some
00:41:05.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m05s

numpy tricks later but basically in this
00:41:07.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m07s

case we only have one image so we have
00:41:10.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m10s

to turn that into a mini batch of images
00:41:13.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m13s

so in other words we need to create a
00:41:15.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m15s

tensor that basically is not just rows
00:41:16.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m16s

by columns by channels but it's number
00:41:21.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m21s

of image by rows by columns by channels
00:41:24.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m24s

and as one image so it's basically
00:41:26.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m26s

becomes a 4 dimensional tensor so
00:41:29.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m29s

there's a cool little trick in numpy
00:41:31.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m31s

that if you index into an array with
00:41:33.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m33s

none that basically adds additional unit
00:41:36.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m36s

access to the start so it turns it from
00:41:39.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m39s

an image into a mini batch of one images
00:41:41.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m41s

and so that's why we had to do that so
00:41:44.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m44s

if you basically find you're trying to
00:41:46.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m46s

do things with a single image with any
00:41:48.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m48s

kind of Pi torch or fast AI thing this
00:41:52.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m52s

is just something you might you might
00:41:55.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m55s

find it says like expecting four
00:41:56.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m56s

dimensions only got three it probably
00:41:59.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m59s

means that or if you get back a return
00:42:02.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m02s

value from something that has like some
00:42:04.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m04s

weird first access that's probably why
00:42:07.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m07s

it's probably giving you like back a
00:42:10.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m10s

mini batch okay and so we'll learn a lot
00:42:11.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m11s

more about this but it's just something
00:42:13.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m13s

to be aware of okay so that's kind of
00:42:15.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m15s

everything you need to do in practice so
00:42:22.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m22s

now we're going to kind of get into a
00:42:28.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m28s

little bit of theory what's actually
00:42:29.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m29s

going on behind the scenes with these
00:42:32.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m32s

convolutional neural networks and you
00:42:34.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m34s

might remember it back in Lesson one we
00:42:36.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m36s

actually saw our first little bit of
00:42:43.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m43s

theory which we stole from this
00:42:48.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m48s

fantastic websites a toaster dot IO
00:42:51.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m51s

either explained visually and we learnt
00:42:53.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m53s

that a that a convolution is something
00:42:56.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m56s

where we basically have a little matrix
00:42:58.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m58s

in deep learning nearly always three by
00:43:01.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m01s

three a little matrix that we basically
00:43:03.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m03s

multiply every element of that matrix by
00:43:06.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m06s

every element of a three by three
00:43:09.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m09s

section of an image add them all
00:43:10.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m10s

together to get the result of that
00:43:14.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m14s

convolution at one point all right now
00:43:16.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m16s

let's see how that all gets turned
00:43:19.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m19s

together to create these these various
00:43:22.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m22s

layers that we saw in the the Zeiler and
00:43:26.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m26s

burgers paper and to do that again I'm
00:43:29.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m29s

going to steal off somebody who's much
00:43:31.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m31s

smarter than I am
00:43:33.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m33s

we're going to steal from a guy called
00:43:35.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m35s

Ottavia good
00:43:38.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m38s

Ottavia oh good was the guy who created
00:43:39.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m39s

Word Lens which nowadays is part of
00:43:42.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m42s

Google Translate if I'm Google Translate
00:43:45.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m45s

you've ever like done that thing where
00:43:47.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m47s

you point your camera at something at
00:43:48.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m48s

something which has any kind of foreign
00:43:52.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m52s

language on it and in real-time it
00:43:54.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m54s

overlays it with the translation that
00:43:56.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m56s

was a views company that built that and
00:43:58.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m58s

so Tokyo was kind enough to share this
00:44:01.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m01s

fantastic video
00:44:03.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m03s

he created he's at Google now and I want
00:44:05.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m05s

to kind of step you through works I
00:44:09.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m09s

think it explains really really well
00:44:10.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m10s

what's going on and then after we look
00:44:12.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m12s

at the video we're going to see how to
00:44:14.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m14s

implement the whole a whole sequence of
00:44:15.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m15s

kintyre set of layers of convolution on
00:44:18.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m18s

your network in Microsoft Excel
00:44:20.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m20s

so with you're a visual learner or a
00:44:23.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m23s

spreadsheet learner hopefully you'll be
00:44:26.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m26s

able to understand all this okay so
00:44:27.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m27s

we're going to start with an image and
00:44:29.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m29s

something that we're going to do later
00:44:32.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m32s

in the course is we're going to learn to
00:44:33.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m33s

nice digits so we'll do it like end to
00:44:35.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m35s

end we'll do the whole thing so this is
00:44:36.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m36s

pretty similar so we're going to try and
00:44:39.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m39s

recognize in this case letters so here's
00:44:41.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m41s

an A which obviously it's actually a
00:44:44.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m44s

grid of numbers right and so there's the
00:44:46.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m46s

creative numbers and so what we do is we
00:44:50.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m50s

take our first convolutional filter so
00:44:51.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m51s

we're assuming this is all this is
00:44:55.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m55s

assuming that these are already learned
00:44:57.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m57s

right and you can see this point it's
00:44:58.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m58s

got wiped down the right-hand side right
00:45:01.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m01s

and black down the left so it's like
00:45:03.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m03s

zero zero zero maybe negative 1 negative
00:45:05.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m05s

1 negative 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 and so we're
00:45:07.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m07s

taking each 3x3 part of the image and
00:45:10.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m10s

multiplying it by that 3x3 matrix not as
00:45:13.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m13s

a matrix product that an element-wise
00:45:16.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m16s

product and so you can see what happens
00:45:18.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m18s

is everywhere where the the white edge
00:45:21.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m21s

is matching the edge of the a and the
00:45:24.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m24s

black edge isn't we're getting green
00:45:28.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m28s

we're getting a positive and everywhere
00:45:30.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m30s

where it's the opposite we're getting a
00:45:32.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m32s

negative we're getting a red right and
00:45:33.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m33s

so that's the first filter creating the
00:45:35.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m35s

first that the result of the first
00:45:39.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m39s

kernel right and so here's a new kernel
00:45:41.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m41s

this one is it's got a white stripe
00:45:44.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m44s

along the top right so we literally scan
00:45:46.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m46s

through every 3x3 part of the matrix
00:45:49.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m49s

multiplying those 3 bits of the a the
00:45:52.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m52s

neighbors of the a by the 9 bits as a
00:45:55.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m55s

filter to find out whether it's red or
00:45:57.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m57s

green and how red or green it is ok and
00:45:59.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m59s

so this is assuming we had two filters
00:46:02.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m02s

one was a bottom edge one was a left
00:46:04.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m04s

edge and you can see here the top edge
00:46:07.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m07s

not surprisingly it's red here so a
00:46:08.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m08s

bottom edge was red here and green here
00:46:10.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m10s

the right edge right here in green here
00:46:12.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m12s

and then in the next step we add a
00:46:15.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m15s

non-linearity ok the rectified linear
00:46:17.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m17s

unit which literally means strongly the
00:46:20.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m20s

negatives so here the Reds all gone okay
00:46:23.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m23s

so here's layer 1 the input
00:46:26.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m26s

here's layup to the result of 2
00:46:28.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m28s

convolutional filters here's layer 3
00:46:30.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m30s

which is which is throw away all of the
00:46:33.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m33s

red stuff and that's called a rectified
00:46:36.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m36s

linear unit and then layer 4 is
00:46:38.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m38s

something called a max pull on a layer 4
00:46:41.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m41s

we replace every 2 by 2 part of this
00:46:43.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m43s

grid
00:46:48.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m48s

and we replace it with its maximum mat
00:46:48.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m48s

so it basically makes it half the size
00:46:51.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m51s

it's basically the same thing but half
00:46:53.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m53s

the size and then we can go through and
00:46:55.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m55s

do exactly the same thing we can have
00:46:57.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m57s

some new filter three by three filter
00:46:59.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m59s

that we put through each of the two
00:47:02.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m02s

results of the previous layer okay and
00:47:04.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m04s

again we can throw away the red bits
00:47:08.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m08s

right so get rid of all the negatives so
00:47:10.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m10s

we just keep the positives that's called
00:47:13.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m13s

applying a rectified linear unit and
00:47:14.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m14s

that gets us to our next layer of this
00:47:18.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m18s

convolutional neural network so you can
00:47:21.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m21s

see that by you know at this layer back
00:47:23.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m23s

here it was kind of very interpretive
00:47:26.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m26s

all it's like we've either got bottom
00:47:29.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m29s

edges or left edges but then the next
00:47:30.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m30s

layer was combining the results of
00:47:33.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m33s

convolutions so it's starting to become
00:47:36.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m36s

a lot less clear like intuitively what's
00:47:37.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m37s

happening but it's doing the same thing
00:47:40.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m40s

and then we do another max pull right so
00:47:42.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m42s

we replace every 2x2 or 3x3 section with
00:47:45.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m45s

a single digit so here this 2x2 it's all
00:47:48.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m48s

black so we replaced it with a black
00:47:52.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m52s

right and then we go and we take that
00:47:53.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m53s

and we we compare it to basically a kind
00:47:56.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m56s

of a template of what we would expect to
00:48:00.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m00s

see if it was an a it was a B but the
00:48:03.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m03s

see it was d give it an E and we see how
00:48:05.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m05s

closely it matches and we can do it in
00:48:07.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m07s

exactly the same way we can multiply
00:48:10.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m10s

every one of the values in this four by
00:48:12.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m12s

eight matrix with every one of the four
00:48:15.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m15s

by eight in this one and this one and
00:48:18.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m18s

this one and we add we just add them
00:48:20.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m20s

together to say like how often does it
00:48:22.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m22s

match versus how often does it not match
00:48:24.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m24s

and then that could be converted to give
00:48:26.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m26s

us a percentage probability that this is
00:48:29.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m29s

a no so in this case this particular
00:48:33.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m33s

template matched well with a so notice
00:48:35.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m35s

we're not doing an each training here
00:48:39.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m39s

right this is how it would work if we
00:48:41.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m41s

have a pre trained model all right so
00:48:43.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m43s

when we download a pre trained imagenet
00:48:46.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m46s

model off the internet and isn't on an
00:48:48.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m48s

image without any changing to it this is
00:48:50.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m50s

what's happening or if we take a model
00:48:52.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m52s

that you've trained and you're applying
00:48:54.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m54s

it to some test set or for some new
00:48:56.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m56s

image this is what it's doing all right
00:48:58.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m58s

as it's basically taking it through it
00:49:00.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m00s

buying a convolution to each layer to
00:49:02.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m02s

each multiple convolutional filters to
00:49:04.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m04s

each layer and then doing the rectified
00:49:08.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m08s

linear unit so throw away the negatives
00:49:12.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m12s

and then do the max pull and then repeat
00:49:14.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m14s

that a bunch of times and so then we can
00:49:18.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m18s

do it with a new letter A or letter B or
00:49:21.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m21s

whatever and keep going through that
00:49:24.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m24s

process right so as you can see that's
00:49:28.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m28s

far nice the visualization thing and I
00:49:31.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m31s

could have created because I'm not at a
00:49:33.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m33s

vo so thanks to him for sharing this
00:49:35.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m35s

with us because it's totally awesome
00:49:37.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m37s

he actually this is not done by hand he
00:49:40.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m40s

actually wrote a piece of computer
00:49:42.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m42s

software to actually do these
00:49:43.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m43s

convolutions this is actually being
00:49:45.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m45s

actually being done dynamically which is
00:49:47.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m47s

pretty cool so I'm more of a spreadsheet
00:49:49.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m49s

guy personally I'm a simple person so
00:49:52.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m52s

here is the same thing now in
00:49:56.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m56s

spreadsheet all right and so you'll find
00:49:58.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m58s

this in the github repo so you can
00:50:00.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m00s

either get clone the repo to your own
00:50:03.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m03s

computer open up the spreadsheet or you
00:50:06.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m06s

can just go to github.com slash / ji and
00:50:08.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m08s

click on this it's it's inside if you go
00:50:11.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m11s

to our repo and just go to courses as
00:50:21.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m21s

usual go to deal 1 as usual you'll see
00:50:23.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m23s

there's an Excel section there okay and
00:50:26.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m26s

so he lay all that so you can just
00:50:29.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m29s

download them by clicking them or you
00:50:30.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m30s

can clone the whole repo and we're
00:50:32.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m32s

looking at cognitive example convolution
00:50:33.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m33s

example all right so you can see I have
00:50:36.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m36s

here an input right so in this case the
00:50:40.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m40s

input is the number 7 so I grab this
00:50:44.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m44s

from a dataset called m-must MN ist
00:50:48.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m48s

which we'll be looking at in a lot of
00:50:51.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m51s

detail and I just took one of those
00:50:52.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m52s

digits at random and I put it into Excel
00:50:55.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m55s

and so you can see every Hextall is
00:50:58.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m58s

actually just a number between 9 1 okay
00:51:01.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m01s

very often actually it'll be a bite
00:51:05.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m05s

between Norton 255 or sometimes it might
00:51:09.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m09s

be a float between naught and 1 it
00:51:13.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m13s

doesn't really matter
00:51:15.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m15s

by the time it gets to PI torch we're
00:51:16.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m16s

generally dealing with floats so we if
00:51:18.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m18s

one of the steps we often will take will
00:51:22.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m22s

be to convert it to a number between
00:51:24.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m24s

naught 1 so then you can see I've just
00:51:25.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m25s

use conditional formatting in Excel to
00:51:29.799
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m29s

kind of make the higher numbers more red
00:51:32.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m32s

so you can clearly see that this is a
00:51:34.509
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m34s

red this is a 7 but but it's just a
00:51:36.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m36s

bunch of numbers that have been imported
00:51:40.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m40s

into Excel okay so here's our input so
00:51:42.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m42s

remember what at a via did was he then
00:51:49.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m49s

applied two filters right with different
00:51:52.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m52s

shapes so here I've created a filter
00:51:55.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m55s

which is designed to detect top edges so
00:51:58.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m58s

this is a 3 by 3 filter okay and I've
00:52:02.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m02s

got ones along the top zeroes in the
00:52:05.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m05s

middle minus ones at the bottom right so
00:52:07.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m07s

let's take a look at an example that's
00:52:10.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m10s

here right and so if I hit that - you
00:52:11.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m11s

can see here highlighted this is the 3
00:52:16.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m16s

by 3 part of the input that this
00:52:19.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m19s

particular thing is calculating right so
00:52:22.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m22s

here you can see it's got 1 1 1 are all
00:52:24.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m24s

being multiplied by 1 and point 1 0 0
00:52:28.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m28s

are all being multiplied by negative 1
00:52:32.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m32s

okay so in other words all the positive
00:52:35.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m35s

bits are getting a lot of positive the
00:52:37.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m37s

negative bits are getting nearly nothing
00:52:39.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m39s

at all so we end up with a high number
00:52:41.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m41s

okay where else on the other side of
00:52:44.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m44s

this bit of the 7 right you can see how
00:52:47.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m47s

you know this is basically zeros here or
00:52:51.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m51s

perhaps more interestingly on the top of
00:52:54.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m54s

it okay here we've got high numbers at
00:52:56.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m56s

the top but we've also got high numbers
00:53:04.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m04s

at the bottom which are negating it ok
00:53:06.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m06s

so you can see that the only place that
00:53:08.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m08s

we end up activating is where we're
00:53:10.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m10s

actually at an edge so in this case this
00:53:14.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m14s

here this number 3 this is called an
00:53:19.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m19s

activation ok so when I say an
00:53:22.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m22s

activation I mean ah
00:53:25.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m25s

at number a number that is calculated
00:53:28.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m28s

and it is calculated by taking some
00:53:33.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m33s

numbers from the input and applying some
00:53:38.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m38s

kind of linear operation in this case a
00:53:42.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m42s

convolutional kernel to calculate an
00:53:46.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m46s

output right you'll notice that other
00:53:48.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m48s

than going inputs multiplied by kernel
00:53:52.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m52s

and summing it together
00:53:56.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m56s

right so here's my some and here's my x
00:53:59.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m59s

then take that and I go max of 0 comma
00:54:03.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m03s

that and so that's my rectified linear
00:54:07.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m07s

unit so it sounds very fancy rectified
00:54:10.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m10s

linear unit but what they actually mean
00:54:13.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m13s

is open up Excel and type equals max 0
00:54:15.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m15s

comma C ok that's all about then you'll
00:54:17.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m17s

see people in the biz so to say value a
00:54:22.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m22s

so ral you means rectified linear unit
00:54:25.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m25s

means max 0 comma thing and I'm not like
00:54:28.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m28s

simplifying it I really mean it like
00:54:32.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m32s

when I say like if I'm simplifying I
00:54:34.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m34s

always say so I'm simplifying but if I'm
00:54:36.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m36s

not saying I'm simplifying that's the
00:54:38.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m38s

entirety okay so a rectified linear unit
00:54:40.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m40s

in its entirety is this and a
00:54:42.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m42s

convolution in its entirety is is this
00:54:45.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m45s

okay so a single layer of a
00:54:50.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m50s

convolutional neural network is being
00:54:54.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m54s

implemented in its entirety
00:54:57.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m57s

here in Excel okay and so you can see
00:55:00.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m00s

what it's done is it's deleted pretty
00:55:03.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m03s

much the vertical edges and highlighted
00:55:06.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m06s

the horizontal edges so again this is
00:55:09.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m09s

assuming that our network is trained and
00:55:12.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m12s

that at the end of training it a created
00:55:15.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m15s

a convolutional filter with these
00:55:18.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m18s

specific line numbers in and so here is
00:55:20.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m20s

a second convolutional filter it's just
00:55:24.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m24s

a different line numbers now pi torch
00:55:28.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m28s

doesn't store them as two separate nine
00:55:32.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m32s

digit arrays it stores it as a tensor
00:55:35.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m35s

right remember a tensor just means an
00:55:38.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m38s

array with more dimensions okay you can
00:55:41.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m41s

use the word array as well it's the same
00:55:46.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m46s

thing but in pi torch they always use
00:55:50.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m50s

the word tensor so I'm going to say
00:55:52.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m52s

cancer okay so it's just a tensor with
00:55:54.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m54s

an additional axis which allows us to
00:55:57.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m57s

stack each of these filters together
00:55:59.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m59s

right filter and kernel pretty much mean
00:56:02.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m02s

the same thing yeah right it refers to
00:56:07.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m07s

one of these three by three matrices or
00:56:09.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m09s

one of these three by three slices of a
00:56:13.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m13s

three dimensional tensor so if I take
00:56:17.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m17s

this one and here I've literally just
00:56:19.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m19s

copied the formulas in Excel from above
00:56:22.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m22s

okay and so you can see this one is now
00:56:23.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m23s

finding a vertebra which as we would
00:56:27.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m27s

expect
00:56:30.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m30s

okay so we've now created one layer
00:56:31.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m31s

right this here is a layer them
00:56:40.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m40s

specifically we'd say it's a hidden
00:56:42.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m42s

layer which is it's not an input layer
00:56:44.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m44s

and it's not an output layer so
00:56:46.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m46s

everything else is a hidden layer okay
00:56:48.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m48s

and this particular hidden layer has is
00:56:50.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m50s

a size two on this dimension right
00:56:55.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m55s

because it has two
00:56:59.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m59s

filters right two kernels so what
00:57:02.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m02s

happens next
00:57:07.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m07s

well let's do another one okay so as we
00:57:09.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m09s

kind of go along things can multiply a
00:57:14.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m14s

little bit in complexity right because
00:57:17.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m17s

my next filter is going to have to
00:57:20.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m20s

contain two of these three by threes
00:57:23.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m23s

because I'm gonna have to say how do I
00:57:27.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m27s

want to bring Adam I want to write these
00:57:28.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m28s

three things and at the same time how do
00:57:31.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m31s

I want to wait the corresponding three
00:57:34.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m34s

things down here right because in pi
00:57:36.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m36s

torch this is going to be this whole
00:57:38.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m38s

thing here is going to be stored as a
00:57:41.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m41s

multi-dimensional tensor right so you
00:57:44.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m44s

shouldn't really think of this now as
00:57:46.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m46s

two 3x3 kernels but one two by three by
00:57:48.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m48s

three eternal okay so to calculate this
00:57:54.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m54s

value here I've got the sum product of
00:57:58.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m58s

all of that plus the sum product of
00:58:02.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m02s

scroll down all of that okay and so the
00:58:09.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m09s

top ones are being multiplied by this
00:58:17.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m17s

part of the kernel and the bottom ones
00:58:19.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m19s

have been multiplied by this part of the
00:58:21.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m21s

kernel and so over time you want to
00:58:22.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m22s

start to get very comfortable with the
00:58:25.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m25s

idea of these like higher dimensional
00:58:28.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m28s

linear combinations right like it's it's
00:58:31.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m31s

harder to draw it on the screen like I
00:58:35.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m35s

had to put one above the other but
00:58:37.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m37s

conceptually just stuck it in your mind
00:58:40.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m40s

like this that's really how you want to
00:58:42.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m42s

think right and actually Geoffrey Hinton
00:58:44.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m44s

in his original 2012 neural Nets
00:58:47.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m47s

Coursera class has a tip which is how
00:58:50.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m50s

all computer scientists deal with like
00:58:54.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m54s

very high dimensional spaces which is
00:58:56.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m56s

that they basically just visualize the
00:58:58.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m58s

two-dimensional space
00:59:01.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m01s

and then say like twelve dimensions
00:59:01.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m01s

really fast and they had lots of tires
00:59:04.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m04s

so that's it
00:59:06.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m06s

right we can see two dimensions on the
00:59:08.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m08s

screen and then you're just going to try
00:59:09.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m09s

to trust that you can have more
00:59:11.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m11s

dimensions like the Const
00:59:14.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m14s

it's just you know there's there's
00:59:15.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m15s

nothing different about them and so you
00:59:17.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m17s

can see in Excel you know Excel doesn't
00:59:19.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m19s

have the ability to handle
00:59:21.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m21s

three-dimensional tensors so I had to
00:59:23.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m23s

like say okay take this two-dimensional
00:59:25.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m25s

dot product add on this two-dimensional
00:59:27.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m27s

dot product right but if there was some
00:59:31.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m31s

kind of 3d Excel I could have to stand
00:59:33.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m33s

that in a single line all right and then
00:59:35.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m35s

again apply max 0 comma otherwise known
00:59:38.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m38s

as rectified linear unit otherwise known
00:59:42.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m42s

as value okay so here is my second layer
00:59:44.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m44s

and so when people create different
00:59:48.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m48s

architectures write an architecture
00:59:51.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m51s

means like how big is your kernel at
00:59:54.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m54s

layer 1
00:59:59.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m59s

how many filters are in your kernel at
00:59:59.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m59s

layer 1 so here I've got a 3 by 3
01:00:02.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m02s

where's number 1 and a 3 by 3 there's
01:00:04.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m04s

number 2 so like this architecture I've
01:00:08.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m08s

created starts off with 2 3 by 3
01:00:11.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m11s

convolutional kernels and then my second
01:00:15.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m15s

layer has another two kernels of size 2
01:00:20.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m20s

by 3 by 3 so there's the first one
01:00:25.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m25s

and then down here here's a second 2 by
01:00:27.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m27s

3 by 3 kernel okay and so remember one
01:00:30.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m30s

of these specific any one of these
01:00:34.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m34s

numbers is an activation okay so this
01:00:35.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m35s

activation is being calculated from
01:00:40.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m40s

these three things here and other 3
01:00:43.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m43s

things up there and we're using these
01:00:45.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m45s

this 2 by 3 by 3 kernel okay and so what
01:00:47.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m47s

tends to happen is people generally give
01:00:52.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m52s

names to their layers so I say okay
01:00:55.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m55s

let's call this layer here con 1 and
01:00:57.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m57s

this layer here and this and this layer
01:01:01.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m01s

here con - all right so that's you know
01:01:07.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m07s

but generally you'll just see that like
01:01:11.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m11s

when you print out a summary of a
01:01:13.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m13s

network every layer will have some kind
01:01:15.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m15s

of name okay and so then what happens
01:01:17.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m17s

next well part of the architecture is
01:01:22.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m22s

like do you have some max pooling where
01:01:26.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m26s

bounces up Matt spalling happen so in
01:01:28.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m28s

this architecture we're inventing we're
01:01:30.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m30s

going to next step is do max fully okay
01:01:32.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m32s

Matt spooling is a little hard to kind
01:01:36.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m36s

of show in Excel but we've got it so max
01:01:40.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m40s

pooling if I do a two by two max pooling
01:01:43.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m43s

it's going to have the resolution both
01:01:45.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m45s

height and width so you can see here
01:01:49.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m49s

that I've replaced these four numbers
01:01:51.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m51s

with the maximum of those four numbers
01:01:57.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m57s

right and so because I'm having the
01:02:00.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m00s

resolution it only makes sense to
01:02:02.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m02s

actually have something every two cells
01:02:04.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m04s

okay so you can see here the way I've
01:02:06.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m06s

got kind of the same looking shape as I
01:02:10.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m10s

had back here okay but it's now half the
01:02:13.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m13s

resolution so for placed every two by
01:02:15.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m15s

two with its max and you'll notice like
01:02:19.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m19s

it's not every possible two by two I
01:02:22.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m22s

skip over from here so this is like
01:02:24.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m24s

starting at beat Hugh and then the next
01:02:26.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m26s

one starts at BS right so they're like
01:02:29.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m29s

non-overlapping that's why it's
01:02:33.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m33s

decreasing the resolution okay
01:02:35.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m35s

so anybody who's comfortable with
01:02:38.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m38s

spreadsheets you know you can open this
01:02:39.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m39s

and have a look and so after our max
01:02:43.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m43s

pooling there's a number of different
01:02:45.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m45s

things we could do next and I'm going to
01:02:52.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m52s

show you a kind of classic old style
01:02:54.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m54s

approach nowadays in fact what generally
01:02:58.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m58s

happens nowadays is we do a max pool
01:03:00.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m00s

where we kind of like max across the
01:03:02.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m02s

entire size right but on older
01:03:04.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m04s

architectures and also on all the
01:03:08.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m08s

structured data stuff we do we actually
01:03:10.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m10s

do something called a fully connected
01:03:12.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m12s

layer and so here's a fully connected
01:03:14.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m14s

layer I'm going to take every single one
01:03:16.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m16s

of these activations and I've got to
01:03:19.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m19s

give every single one of them or weight
01:03:22.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m22s

right and so then I'm going to take over
01:03:24.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m24s

here here is the sum product of every
01:03:28.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m28s

one of the activations by every one of
01:03:33.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m33s

the weights for both of the
01:03:35.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m35s

two levels of my three-dimensional
01:03:40.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m40s

tensor right and so this is called a
01:03:43.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m43s

fully connected layer notice it's
01:03:45.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m45s

different to a convolution I'm not going
01:03:47.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m47s

through a few at a time right but I'm
01:03:49.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m49s

creating a really big weight matrix
01:03:51.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m51s

right so rather than having a couple of
01:03:54.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m54s

little 3x3 kernels my weight matrix is
01:03:57.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m57s

now as big as the entire input and so as
01:03:59.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m59s

you can imagine architectures that make
01:04:03.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m03s

heavy use of fully convolutional layers
01:04:07.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m07s

can have a lot of weights which means
01:04:09.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m09s

they can have trouble with overfitting
01:04:13.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m13s

and they can also be slow and so you're
01:04:15.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m15s

going to see a lot an architecture
01:04:17.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m17s

called vgg because it was the first kind
01:04:20.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m20s

of successful deeper architecture it has
01:04:23.299
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m23s

up to 19 layers and vgg actually
01:04:25.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m25s

contains a fully connected layer with
01:04:28.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m28s

4096 weights connected to a hidden layer
01:04:31.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m31s

with 4,000 sorry 4096 activations
01:04:35.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m35s

connected to a hidden layer with 4096
01:04:39.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m39s

activations so you've got like 4096 by
01:04:42.859
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m42s

4096 x remember or apply it by the
01:04:46.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m46s

number of kind of kernels that we've
01:04:50.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m50s

calculated so in vgg there's this I
01:04:53.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m53s

think it's like 300 million weights of
01:04:59.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m59s

which something like 250 million of them
01:05:03.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m03s

are in these fully connected layers so
01:05:06.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m06s

we'll learn later on in the course about
01:05:09.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m09s

how we can kind of avoid using these big
01:05:11.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m11s

fully connected layers and behind the
01:05:13.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m13s

scenes all the stuff that you've seen us
01:05:15.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m15s

using like ResNet and res next none of
01:05:17.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m17s

them use very large fully connected
01:05:20.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m20s

layers you know you had a question
01:05:22.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m22s

sorry yeah come on um so could you tell
01:05:26.049
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m26s

us more about for example if we had like
01:05:30.319
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m30s

three channels for the input what would
01:05:32.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m32s

be the shape yeah these filters right so
01:05:34.819
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m34s

that's a great question so if we have 3
01:05:40.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m40s

channels of input it would look exactly
01:05:42.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m42s

like conv one right cons one kind of has
01:05:44.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m44s

two channels right and so you can see
01:05:48.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m48s

with cons one we had two channels so
01:05:52.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m52s

therefore our filters had to have like
01:05:54.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m54s

two channels per filter and so you could
01:05:57.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m57s

like imagine that this input didn't
01:06:00.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m00s

exist you know and actually this was the
01:06:02.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m02s

airport alright so when you have a
01:06:05.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m05s

multi-channel input it just means that
01:06:06.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m06s

your filters look like this and so
01:06:09.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m09s

images often full color they have three
01:06:11.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m11s

red green and blue sometimes they also
01:06:15.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m15s

have an alpha Channel so however many
01:06:17.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m17s

you have that's how many inputs you need
01:06:20.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m20s

and so something which I know Jeanette
01:06:23.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m23s

was playing with recently was like using
01:06:25.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m25s

a full color image net model in medical
01:06:27.529
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m27s

imaging for something called bone age
01:06:32.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m32s

calculations which has a single channel
01:06:34.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m34s

and so what she did was basically take
01:06:36.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m36s

the the input the the single channel
01:06:38.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m38s

input and make three copies of it so you
01:06:42.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m42s

end up with basically like one two three
01:06:45.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m45s

versions of the same thing which is like
01:06:48.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m48s

it's kind of a small idea like it's kind
01:06:52.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m52s

of redundant information that we don't
01:06:55.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m55s

quite want but it does mean that then if
01:06:57.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m57s

you had a something that expected a
01:06:59.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m59s

three channel convolutional filter you
01:07:01.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m01s

can use it right and so at the moment
01:07:05.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m05s

there's a cable competition for iceberg
01:07:08.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m08s

detection using a some funky satellite
01:07:11.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m11s

specific data format that has two
01:07:15.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m15s

channels so here's how you could do that
01:07:17.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m17s

you could either copy one of those two
01:07:20.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m20s

channels into the third channel or I
01:07:23.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m23s

think what people in Carroll are doing
01:07:25.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m25s

is to take the average of the two again
01:07:27.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m27s

it's not ideal but it's a way that you
01:07:30.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m30s

can use pre-trained networks yeah I've
01:07:32.779
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m32s

done a lot of fiddling around like that
01:07:37.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m37s

you can also actually I've actually done
01:07:40.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m40s

things where I wanted to use a three
01:07:42.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m42s

channel image net Network on four
01:07:45.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m45s

channel data
01:07:47.569
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m47s

I had a satellite data where the fourth
01:07:48.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m48s

channel was near-infrared and so
01:07:50.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m50s

basically I added an extra kind of level
01:07:53.029
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m53s

to my convolutional kernels that were
01:07:59.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m59s

all zeros and so basically like started
01:08:02.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m02s

off by ignoring the near-infrared band
01:08:04.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m04s

and
01:08:06.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m06s

so what happens it basically and you'll
01:08:08.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m08s

see this next week is that rather than
01:08:10.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m10s

having these like carefully trained
01:08:13.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m13s

filters when you're actually training
01:08:15.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m15s

something from scratch we're actually
01:08:17.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m17s

going to start with random numbers
01:08:19.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m19s

that's actually what we do we actually
01:08:21.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m21s

start with random numbers and then we
01:08:23.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m23s

use this thing called stochastic
01:08:25.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m25s

gradient descent which we've kind of
01:08:26.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m26s

seen conceptually
01:08:27.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m27s

to slightly improve those random numbers
01:08:29.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m29s

to make them less random and we
01:08:31.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m31s

basically do that again and again and
01:08:33.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m33s

again okay great
01:08:35.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m35s

let's take a seven minute break and
01:08:37.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m37s

we'll come back at 7:50 all right so
01:08:39.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m39s

what happens next
01:08:48.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m48s

so we've got as far as doing a fully
01:08:50.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m50s

connected layer right so we had our the
01:08:57.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m57s

results of our max pooling layer got fed
01:09:00.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m00s

to a fully connected layer and he might
01:09:02.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m02s

notice those of you that remember your
01:09:04.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m04s

linear algebra the fully connected layer
01:09:07.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m07s

is actually doing a classic traditional
01:09:09.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m09s

matrix product okay so it's basically
01:09:11.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m11s

just going through each pair in turn
01:09:14.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m14s

multiplying them together and then
01:09:17.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m17s

adding them up to do a matrix product
01:09:19.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m19s

now in practice if we want to calculate
01:09:23.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m23s

which one of the ten digits we're
01:09:33.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m33s

looking at their single number we've
01:09:36.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m36s

calculated isn't enough we would
01:09:40.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m40s

actually calculate ten numbers so what
01:09:44.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m44s

we will have is rather than just having
01:09:48.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m48s

one set of fully connected weights like
01:09:50.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m50s

this and I say set because remember
01:09:55.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m55s

there's like a whole 3d kind of tensor
01:09:57.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m57s

of them we would actually need ten of
01:10:00.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m00s

those right so you can see that these
01:10:04.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m04s

tensors start to get a little bit high
01:10:06.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m06s

dimensional right and so this is where
01:10:09.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m09s

my patients we're doing it next cell ran
01:10:12.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m12s

out but imagine that I had done this ten
01:10:14.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m14s

times I could now have ten different
01:10:17.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m17s

numbers or being calculated
01:10:19.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m19s

yeah using exactly the same process
01:10:21.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m21s

right we'll just be ten of these fully
01:10:23.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m23s

connected to by m-by-n erased basically
01:10:27.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m27s

and so then we would have ten numbers
01:10:35.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m35s

being spat out so what happens next so
01:10:40.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m40s

next up we can open up a different Excel
01:10:44.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m44s

worksheet entropy example dot XLS that's
01:10:48.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m48s

got two different worksheets one of them
01:10:52.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m52s

is called soft mass and what happens
01:10:56.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m56s

here sorry I've changed domains rather
01:10:59.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m59s

than predicting whether it's the number
01:11:02.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m02s

from one not to nine I'm going to
01:11:04.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m04s

predict whether something is a cat a dog
01:11:06.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m06s

a plane of Fisher Building okay so out
01:11:07.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m07s

of our that fully connected layer we've
01:11:10.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m10s

got this case we'd have five numbers and
01:11:14.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m14s

notice at this point there's no rail you
01:11:16.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m16s

okay in the last layer there's no rail
01:11:20.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m20s

you okay so I can have negatives so I
01:11:23.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m23s

want to turn these five numbers H into a
01:11:27.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m27s

probability I want to turn it into a
01:11:32.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m32s

probability from naught to one that it's
01:11:34.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m34s

a cat
01:11:37.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m37s

that's a dog there's a plane that it's a
01:11:37.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m37s

fish that it's a building and I want
01:11:40.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m40s

those probabilities to have a couple of
01:11:42.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m42s

characteristics first is that each of
01:11:44.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m44s

them should be between zero and one and
01:11:45.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m45s

the second is that this state together
01:11:48.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m48s

should add up to one right it's
01:11:50.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m50s

definitely one of these five things okay
01:11:52.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m52s

so to do that we use a different kind of
01:11:55.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m55s

activation function what's an activation
01:11:58.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m58s

function an activation function is a
01:12:01.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m01s

function that is applied to activations
01:12:04.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m04s

so for example max 0 comma something is
01:12:07.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m07s

a function that I applied to an
01:12:13.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m13s

activation so an activation function
01:12:16.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m16s

always takes in one number and spits out
01:12:18.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m18s

one number so max of 0 comma X takes in
01:12:23.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m23s

a number X and spits out some different
01:12:27.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m27s

number value of s
01:12:29.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m29s

that's all an activation function is and
01:12:33.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m33s

if you remember back to that PowerPoint
01:12:35.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m35s

we saw in Lesson one
01:12:39.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m39s

each of our layers was just a linear
01:12:45.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m45s

function and then after every layer we
01:12:50.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m50s

said we needed some non-linearity act as
01:12:55.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m55s

if you stack a bunch of linear layers
01:12:58.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m58s

together right then all you end up with
01:13:01.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m01s

is a linear layer okay
01:13:04.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m04s

so somebody's talking can can you not a
01:13:06.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m06s

slow just acting thank you
01:13:09.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m09s

if you stack a number of linear
01:13:13.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m13s

functions together you just end up with
01:13:15.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m15s

a linear function and nobody does any
01:13:18.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m18s

cool deep learning with displaying your
01:13:20.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m20s

functions right but remember we also
01:13:22.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m22s

learnt that by stacking linear functions
01:13:24.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m24s

with between each one a non-linearity we
01:13:29.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m29s

could create like arbitrarily complex
01:13:33.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m33s

shapes and so the non-linearity that
01:13:34.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m34s

we're using after every hidden layer is
01:13:37.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m37s

a rally rectified linear unit a
01:13:39.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m39s

non-linearity is an activation function
01:13:42.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m42s

an activation function is a
01:13:45.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m45s

non-linearity in with in deep way
01:13:48.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m48s

obviously there's lots of other
01:13:51.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m51s

nonlinearities and in the world but in
01:13:52.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m52s

deep learning this is what we mean so an
01:13:54.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m54s

activation function is any function that
01:13:58.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m58s

takes some activation in as a single
01:14:00.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m00s

number and spits out some new activation
01:14:02.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m02s

like max of 0 comma so I'm now going to
01:14:04.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m04s

tell you about a different activation
01:14:08.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m08s

function it's slightly more complicated
01:14:10.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m10s

than value but not too much it's called
01:14:12.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m12s

soft max soft max only ever occurs in
01:14:16.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m16s

the final layer at the very end and the
01:14:19.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m19s

reason why is that soft max always spits
01:14:22.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m22s

out numbers as an activation function
01:14:24.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m24s

that always spits out a number between
01:14:27.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m27s

Norton 1 and it always spits out a bunch
01:14:29.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m29s

of numbers that add to 1 so a soft max
01:14:32.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m32s

gives us what we want right in theory
01:14:35.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m35s

this isn't strictly necessary right like
01:14:39.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m39s

we could ask our neural net to learn a
01:14:43.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m43s

set of kernels which have you know which
01:14:46.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m46s

which give probabilities that line up as
01:14:50.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m50s

closely as possible with what we want
01:14:53.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m53s

but in general with deep learning if you
01:14:54.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m54s

can construct your architecture so that
01:14:57.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m57s

the desired characteristics are as easy
01:14:59.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m59s

to express as possible you'll end up
01:15:03.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m03s

with better models like they'll learn
01:15:06.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m06s

more quickly with less parameters so in
01:15:07.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m07s

this case we know that our probabilities
01:15:10.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m10s

should end up being between 9 1 we know
01:15:13.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m13s

that they should end up adding to 1 so
01:15:16.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m16s

if we construct an activation function
01:15:18.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m18s

which always has those features then
01:15:20.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m20s

we're going to make our neural network
01:15:23.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m23s

do a better job
01:15:24.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m24s

it's gonna make it easier for it it
01:15:26.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m26s

doesn't have to learn to do those things
01:15:27.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m27s

because it all happen automatically okay
01:15:29.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m29s

so in order to make this work we first
01:15:32.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m32s

of all have to get rid of all of the
01:15:37.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m37s

negatives right like we can't have
01:15:39.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m39s

negative probabilities so to make things
01:15:41.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m41s

not being negative one way we could do
01:15:44.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m44s

it is just go into the pair of right so
01:15:46.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m46s

here you can see my first step is to go
01:15:49.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m49s

X of the previous one right and I think
01:15:51.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m51s

I've mentioned this before but of all
01:15:55.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m55s

the math that you just need to be super
01:15:58.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m58s

familiar with to do deep learning the
01:16:01.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m01s

one you really need is logarithms and
01:16:03.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m03s

asks write all of deep learning and all
01:16:05.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m05s

of machine learning they appear all the
01:16:08.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m08s

time right so for example you absolutely
01:16:10.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m10s

need to know that log of x times y
01:16:19.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m19s

equals log of X plus log of Y all right
01:16:24.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m24s

and like not just know that that's a
01:16:33.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m33s

formula that exists but have a sense of
01:16:35.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m35s

like what does that mean why is that
01:16:37.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m37s

interesting oh I can turn
01:16:39.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m39s

multiplications into additions that
01:16:41.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m41s

could be really handy right and
01:16:42.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m42s

therefore log of x over y equals log of
01:16:45.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m45s

X minus log of Y again that's going to
01:16:50.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m50s

come in pretty handy you know rather
01:16:56.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m56s

than dividing I can just subtract things
01:16:57.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m57s

right and also remember that if I've got
01:16:59.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m59s

log of x equals y then that means a to
01:17:03.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m03s

the y equals x in other words log log
01:17:08.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m08s

and E to the for the inverse of each
01:17:14.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m14s

other okay again you just you need to
01:17:17.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m17s

really really understand these things
01:17:21.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m21s

and like so if you if you haven't spent
01:17:23.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m23s

much time with logs and X for a while
01:17:25.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m25s

try plotting them in Excel or a notebook
01:17:27.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m27s

have a sense of what shape they are how
01:17:31.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m31s

they combine together just make sure
01:17:33.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m33s

you're really comfortable with them so
01:17:35.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m35s

we're using it here right we're using it
01:17:38.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m38s

here so one of the things that we know
01:17:42.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m42s

is a to the power of something is
01:17:44.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m44s

positive okay so that's great
01:17:46.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m46s

the other thing you'll notice about e to
01:17:49.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m49s

the power of something is because it's a
01:17:50.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m50s

power numbers that are slightly bigger
01:17:52.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m52s

than other numbers like four is a little
01:17:56.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m56s

bit bigger than 2.8 when you go e to the
01:17:58.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m58s

power of it really accentuates that
01:18:00.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m00s

difference okay
01:18:02.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m02s

so we're going to take advantage of both
01:18:04.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m04s

of these features for the purpose of
01:18:05.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m05s

deep learning okay so we take our the
01:18:06.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m06s

results of this fully connected layer we
01:18:10.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m10s

go e to the power of for each of them
01:18:13.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m13s

and then we're gonna yeah and then we're
01:18:15.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m15s

going to add them up okay so here is the
01:18:24.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m24s

sum of e to the power of so then here
01:18:28.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m28s

we're going to take e to the power of
01:18:32.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m32s

divided by the sum of e to the power of
01:18:35.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m35s

so if you take all of these things
01:18:37.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m37s

divided by their sum then by definition
01:18:41.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m41s

all of those things must add up to 1 and
01:18:43.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m43s

furthermore since we're dividing by
01:18:49.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m49s

their sum they must always vary between
01:18:51.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m51s

0 and 1 because they were always
01:18:54.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m54s

positive alright and that's it so that's
01:18:56.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m56s

what softmax is ok so I've got this kind
01:18:59.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m59s

of doing random numbers each time right
01:19:04.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m04s

and so you can see like as I as I look
01:19:08.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m08s

through my softmax generally has quite a
01:19:11.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m11s

few things that are so close to zero
01:19:14.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m14s

that they round down to zero and you
01:19:16.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m16s

know maybe one thing that's nearly 1
01:19:19.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m19s

right and the reason for that is what we
01:19:20.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m20s

just talked about that is with the X
01:19:23.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m23s

just having one number a bit bigger than
01:19:25.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m25s

the others tends to like push it out
01:19:28.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m28s

further right so even though my inputs
01:19:30.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m30s

here around on numbers between negative
01:19:33.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m33s

5 and 5 right my outputs from the
01:19:35.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m35s

softmax don't really look that random at
01:19:39.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m39s

all in the sense that they tend to have
01:19:41.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m41s

one big number and a bunch of small
01:19:44.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m44s

numbers and now that's what we want
01:19:47.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m47s

right we want to say like in terms of
01:19:50.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m50s

like is this a cat a dog a plane a fish
01:19:53.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m53s

or a building we really want it to say
01:19:55.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m55s

like it's it's that you know it's it's a
01:19:57.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m57s

dog or it's a plane not like I don't
01:20:00.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m00s

know okay so softmax has lots of these
01:20:03.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m03s

cool properties right it's going to
01:20:07.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m07s

return a probability that adds up to 1
01:20:10.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m10s

and it's going to tend to want to pick
01:20:12.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m12s

one thing particularly strongly okay so
01:20:14.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m14s

that's soft mess your net could you pass
01:20:20.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m20s

actually bust me up we how would we do
01:20:22.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m22s

something that as let's say you have any
01:20:29.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m29s

imaging you want to count in categorize
01:20:31.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m31s

I was like cat and the dog or like has
01:20:32.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m32s

multiple things but what kind of
01:20:34.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m34s

function will we try to use so happens
01:20:37.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m37s

we're going to do that right now so
01:20:40.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m40s

so hope you think about why we might
01:20:45.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m45s

want to do that and so runways where you
01:20:47.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m47s

might want to do that is to do
01:20:48.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m48s

multi-label classification so we're
01:20:50.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m50s

looking now at listen to image models
01:20:53.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m53s

and specifically we're going to take a
01:20:54.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m54s

look at the planet competition satellite
01:20:57.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m57s

imaging competition now the satellite
01:21:00.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m00s

imaging competition has some
01:21:04.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m04s

similarities to stuff we've seen before
01:21:08.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m08s

right so before we've seen cat versus
01:21:09.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m09s

dog and these images are a cat or a dog
01:21:13.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m13s

they're not Maya they're not both right
01:21:15.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m15s

but the satellite imaging competition
01:21:19.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m19s

has stayed as images that look like this
01:21:22.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m22s

and in fact every single one of the
01:21:25.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m25s

images is classified by whether there's
01:21:27.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m27s

four kinds of weather
01:21:30.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m30s

one of which is haze and another of
01:21:31.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m31s

which is clear in addition to which
01:21:34.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m34s

there is a list of features that may be
01:21:37.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m37s

present including agriculture which is
01:21:39.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m39s

like some some cleared area used for
01:21:42.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m42s

agriculture primary which means primary
01:21:44.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m44s

rainforest and water which means a river
01:21:48.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m48s

or a creek so here is a clear day
01:21:50.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m50s

satellite image showing some agriculture
01:21:54.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m54s

some primary rainforest and some water
01:21:56.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m56s

features and here's one which is in haze
01:21:59.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m59s

and is entirely primary rainforest so in
01:22:02.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m02s

this case we're going to want to be able
01:22:07.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m07s

to show we're going to predict multiple
01:22:09.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m09s

things and so softmax wouldn't be good
01:22:13.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m13s

because softmax doesn't like predicting
01:22:15.689
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m15s

multiple things and like I would
01:22:19.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m19s

definitely recommend anthropomorphizing
01:22:21.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m21s

your activation functions right they
01:22:23.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m23s

have personalities okay and the
01:22:25.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m25s

personality of the softmax is it wants
01:22:28.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m28s

to pick a thing and people forget this
01:22:30.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m30s

all the time I've seen many people even
01:22:34.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m34s

well-regarded researchers in famous
01:22:36.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m36s

academic papers using like soft maps for
01:22:39.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m39s

multi-label classification it happens
01:22:44.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m44s

all the time
01:22:46.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m46s

right and it's kind of ridiculous
01:22:46.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m46s

because they're not understanding the
01:22:49.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m49s

personality of their activation function
01:22:52.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m52s

so for multi
01:22:55.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m55s

classification where each sample can
01:22:58.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m58s

belong to one or more classes we have to
01:23:00.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m00s

change a few things but here's the good
01:23:03.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m03s

news
01:23:05.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m05s

in fast AI we don't have to change
01:23:05.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m05s

anything right so fast AI will look at
01:23:08.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m08s

the labels in the CSV and if there is
01:23:12.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m12s

more than one label ever for any item it
01:23:15.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m15s

will automatically switch into like
01:23:21.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m21s

multi-label mode so I'm going to show
01:23:23.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m23s

you how it works behind the scenes but
01:23:25.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m25s

the good news is you don't actually have
01:23:27.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m27s

to care it happens anywhere so if you
01:23:29.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m29s

have multi label images multi label
01:23:35.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m35s

objects you obviously can't use the
01:23:40.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m40s

classic Kerris style approach where
01:23:43.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m43s

things are in folders because something
01:23:46.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m46s

can't conveniently be in multiple
01:23:48.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m48s

folders at the same time right so that's
01:23:51.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m51s

why we you basically have to use the
01:23:55.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m55s

from CSV approach right so if we look at
01:23:57.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m57s

[Music]
01:24:04.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m04s

an example actually I'll show you I tend
01:24:06.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m06s

to take you through it right so we can
01:24:12.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m12s

say okay this is the CSV file containing
01:24:14.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m14s

our labels this looks exactly the same
01:24:16.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m16s

as I did before but rather than side on
01:24:18.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m18s

its top down alright and top down I've
01:24:21.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m21s

mentioned before that can do our
01:24:24.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m24s

vertical flips it actually does more
01:24:27.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m27s

than that there's actually eight
01:24:28.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m28s

possible symmetries for a square which
01:24:29.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m29s

is it can be rotated through 90 180 270
01:24:32.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m32s

or 0 degrees and for each of those it
01:24:35.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m35s

can be flipped and if you think about it
01:24:37.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m37s

for awhile you'll realize that that's a
01:24:39.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m39s

complete enumeration of everything that
01:24:42.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m42s

you can do in terms of symmetries to a
01:24:45.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m45s

square so they're called it's called the
01:24:48.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m48s

dihedral group of eight so if you see in
01:24:50.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m50s

the code there's actually a transform or
01:24:53.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m53s

dihedral that's why it's called that so
01:24:55.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m55s

this transforms will basically do the
01:24:59.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m59s

full set of eight symmetric dihedral
01:25:01.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m01s

rotations and flips plus everything
01:25:05.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m05s

which we can do to dogs and cats
01:25:09.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m09s

you know small clinical rotations a
01:25:11.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m11s

little bit of zooming a little bit of
01:25:13.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m13s

contrast and brightness adjustment so
01:25:16.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m16s

these images are a size 256 by 256 so I
01:25:18.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m18s

just create a little function here to
01:25:23.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m23s

let me quickly grab you know data loader
01:25:24.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m24s

of any size so here's a 256 by 256 once
01:25:28.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m28s

you've got a data object inside it we've
01:25:32.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m32s

already seen that there's things called
01:25:36.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m36s

Val D s test D s train D s there are
01:25:37.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m37s

things that you can just index into and
01:25:41.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m41s

grab a particular image so you just use
01:25:43.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m43s

square brackets 0 you'll also see that
01:25:45.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m45s

all of those things have a DL that's a
01:25:48.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m48s

data loader so des is data set DL is
01:25:50.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m50s

data motor these are concepts from PI
01:25:53.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m53s

watch so if you Google PI torch data set
01:25:55.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m55s

or pipe watch data loader you can
01:25:58.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m58s

basically see what it means but the
01:26:00.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m00s

basic idea is a data set gives you a
01:26:02.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m02s

single image or a single object back a
01:26:04.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m04s

data loader gives you back a mini batch
01:26:08.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m08s

and specifically it gives you back a
01:26:10.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m10s

transformed mini - so that's why when we
01:26:12.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m12s

create our data object we can pass in
01:26:15.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m15s

num workers and transforms it's like how
01:26:20.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m20s

many processes do you want to use what
01:26:24.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m24s

transforms do you want and so with with
01:26:25.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m25s

a data loader you can't ask for an
01:26:28.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m28s

individual image you can only get back
01:26:30.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m30s

at a mini batch and you can't get back a
01:26:32.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m32s

particular mini batch you can only get
01:26:35.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m35s

back the next mini - so something
01:26:37.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m37s

reverses look through grabbing a mini
01:26:39.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m39s

batch at a time and so in Python the
01:26:42.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m42s

thing that does that is called a
01:26:46.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m46s

generator right or an iterator this
01:26:47.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m47s

slightly different versions are the same
01:26:50.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m50s

thing so to turn a data loader into an
01:26:51.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m51s

iterator you use the standard Python
01:26:54.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m54s

function cordetta
01:26:56.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m56s

that's a Python function just a regular
01:26:57.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m57s

part of the Python basic language that
01:27:00.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m00s

returns you an iterator and an iterator
01:27:02.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m02s

is something that takes you can pass the
01:27:04.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m04s

static give pass it to the standard
01:27:07.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m07s

Python function or statement next and
01:27:08.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m08s

that just says give me another batch
01:27:13.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m13s

from this iterator
01:27:15.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m15s

so we're basically this is one of the
01:27:18.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m18s

things I really like about PI torch is
01:27:21.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m21s

it really leverages
01:27:23.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m23s

modern pythons kind of stuff you know in
01:27:24.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m24s

in tensorflow they invent their whole
01:27:28.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m28s

new world earth ways of doing things and
01:27:31.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m31s

so it's kind of more in a sense it's
01:27:35.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m35s

more like cross-platform but in another
01:27:38.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m38s

sense like it's not a good fit to any
01:27:40.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m40s

platform so it's nice if you if you know
01:27:42.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m42s

Python well PI torch comes very
01:27:46.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m46s

naturally if you don't know Python well
01:27:49.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m49s

PI torches are good reason to learn
01:27:52.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m52s

Python well a PI torch your module
01:27:53.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m53s

neural network module is a standard
01:27:58.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m58s

Python bus for example so any work you
01:28:00.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m00s

put into learning Python better will pay
01:28:03.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m03s

off with paid watch so here I am using
01:28:05.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m05s

standard Python iterators and next to
01:28:08.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m08s

grab my next mini batch from the
01:28:12.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m12s

validation sets data loader and that's
01:28:15.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m15s

going to return two things it's going to
01:28:17.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m17s

return the images in the mini batch and
01:28:19.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m19s

the labels of the mini - so standard
01:28:20.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m20s

Python approach I can pull them apart
01:28:23.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m23s

like so and so here is one mini batch of
01:28:25.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m25s

labels and so not surprisingly since I
01:28:30.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m30s

said that my batch size let's go ahead
01:28:34.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m34s

and find it
01:28:37.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m37s

Oh actually it's the batch size by
01:28:41.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m41s

default is 64 so I didn't pass in a
01:28:44.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m44s

batch size and so just remember shift
01:28:47.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m47s

tab to see like what are the things you
01:28:50.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m50s

can pass and what are the defaults so by
01:28:52.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m52s

default my batch size is 64 so I've got
01:28:54.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m54s

that something of size 64 by 17 so there
01:28:57.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m57s

are 17 of the possible classes right so
01:29:01.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m01s

let's take a look at the zeroth set of
01:29:07.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m07s

labels so the zeroth images labels so I
01:29:12.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m12s

can zip again standard Python things it
01:29:15.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m15s

takes two lists and combines it so you
01:29:18.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m18s

get the zero theme from the first list
01:29:21.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m21s

as you're asking for the second list and
01:29:23.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m23s

the first thing for the first first this
01:29:25.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m25s

first thing from the second list and so
01:29:27.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m27s

forth so I can zip them together and
01:29:29.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m29s

that way I can find out for the zeroth
01:29:31.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m31s

image and the validation set is
01:29:34.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m34s

agriculture
01:29:36.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m36s

it's clear its primary rainforest its
01:29:38.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m38s

slash-and-burn its water okay so as you
01:29:42.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m42s

can see here this is a MOLLE label you
01:29:47.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m47s

see here's a way to do multi-label
01:29:51.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m51s

classification so by the same token
01:29:53.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m53s

right if we go back to our single label
01:29:57.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m57s

classification it's a cat dog playing
01:30:01.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m01s

official building behind the scenes we
01:30:03.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m03s

haven't actually looked at it but behind
01:30:07.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m07s

the scenes fast AI imply torch are
01:30:08.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m08s

turning our labels into something called
01:30:12.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m12s

one hot encoded labels and so if it was
01:30:15.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m15s

actually a dog than the actual values
01:30:18.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m18s

would be like that right so these are
01:30:22.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m22s

like the actuals okay so do you remember
01:30:25.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m25s

at the very end of at AV o--'s video he
01:30:29.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m29s

showed how like the template had to
01:30:32.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m32s

match to one of the like five ABCDE
01:30:34.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m34s

templates and so what it's actually
01:30:36.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m36s

doing is it's comparing when I said it's
01:30:39.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m39s

basically doing a dot product it's
01:30:42.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m42s

actually a fully connected layer at the
01:30:44.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m44s

end right that calculates an output
01:30:46.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m46s

activation that goes through a soft Max
01:30:50.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m50s

and then the soft max is compared to the
01:30:52.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m52s

one hot encoded label right so if it was
01:30:56.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m56s

a dog there would be a one here and then
01:30:59.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m59s

we take the difference between the
01:31:03.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m03s

actuals and the softmax activation is to
01:31:05.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m05s

say and add those add up those
01:31:08.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m08s

differences to say how much error is
01:31:10.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m10s

there essentially we're skipping over
01:31:12.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m12s

something called a loss function that
01:31:14.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m14s

we'll learn about next week but
01:31:16.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m16s

essentially we're basically doing that
01:31:17.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m17s

now if it's one hot encoded like there's
01:31:21.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m21s

only one thing which have a 1 in it then
01:31:25.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m25s

actually storing it as 0 1 0 0 0 is
01:31:28.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m28s

terribly inefficient right like we could
01:31:32.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m32s

basically say what are the index of each
01:31:36.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m36s

of these things right so we can say it's
01:31:38.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m38s

like 0 1 2 3 4 like so right and so
01:31:40.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m40s

rather than storing it is 0 1 0 0 0
01:31:44.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m44s

we actually just store the index value
01:31:48.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m48s

right so if you look at the the Y values
01:31:52.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m52s

for the cats and dogs competition or the
01:31:56.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m56s

dog breeds competition you won't
01:31:58.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m58s

actually see a big lists of ones and
01:32:01.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m01s

zeros like this you'll see a single
01:32:03.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m03s

integer right which is like what what
01:32:04.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m04s

class index is it right and internally
01:32:07.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m07s

inside pipe arch it will actually turn
01:32:11.680
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m11s

that into a one hot encoded vector but
01:32:15.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m15s

like you will literally never see it
01:32:17.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m17s

okay and and pi torch has different loss
01:32:19.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m19s

functions where you basically say this
01:32:23.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m23s

thing's won this thing is one hot
01:32:26.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m26s

encoder door this thing is not and it
01:32:27.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m27s

uses different bus functions
01:32:30.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m30s

that's all hidden by the faster I
01:32:31.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m31s

library right so like you don't have to
01:32:34.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m34s

worry about it but is but the the cool
01:32:36.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m36s

thing to realize is that this approach
01:32:40.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m40s

for multi-label encoding with these ones
01:32:42.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m42s

and zeros behind the scenes the exact
01:32:45.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m45s

same thing happens for single level
01:32:48.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m48s

classification does it make sense to
01:32:51.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m51s

change the beginners of the sigmoid of
01:32:56.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m56s

the softmax function by changing the
01:32:59.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m59s

base no because when you change the more
01:33:00.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m00s

math log base a of B equals log B over
01:33:07.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m07s

log a so changing the base is just a
01:33:19.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m19s

linear scaling and linear scaling is
01:33:24.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m24s

something which the neural net can
01:33:27.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m27s

with very easily
01:33:29.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m29s

good question okay so here is that image
01:33:35.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m35s

right here is the image with
01:33:42.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m42s

slash-and-burn water etc etc one of the
01:33:44.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m44s

things to notice here is like when I
01:33:47.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m47s

first displayed this image it was so
01:33:49.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m49s

washed out I really couldn't see it
01:33:54.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m54s

right but remember images now you know
01:33:56.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m56s

we know images are just matrices of
01:34:00.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m00s

numbers and so you can see here I just
01:34:02.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m02s

said times 1.4 just to make it more
01:34:04.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m04s

visible right so like now that you kind
01:34:08.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m08s

of it's the kind of thing I want you to
01:34:11.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m11s

get familiar with is the idea that this
01:34:12.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m12s

stuff you're dealing with
01:34:14.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m14s

they're just matrices of numbers and you
01:34:15.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m15s

can fiddle around with them so if you're
01:34:18.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m18s

looking at something like guys a bit
01:34:19.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m19s

washed out you can just multiply it by
01:34:21.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m21s

something to brighten it up a bit okay
01:34:22.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m22s

so here we can see I guess this is the
01:34:25.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m25s

slash-and-burn here's the river that's
01:34:27.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m27s

the water here's the primary rainforest
01:34:30.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m30s

maybe that's the agriculture so forth
01:34:33.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m33s

okay so so you know with all that
01:34:35.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m35s

background how do we actually use this
01:34:41.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m41s

exactly the same way as everything we've
01:34:44.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m44s

done before right so you know size and
01:34:46.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m46s

and the interesting thing about playing
01:34:49.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m49s

around with this planet competition is
01:34:52.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m52s

that these images are not at all like
01:34:54.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m54s

image there and I would guess that the
01:34:56.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m56s

vast majority is of stuff that the vast
01:35:00.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m00s

majority of you do involving
01:35:02.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m02s

convolutional neural Nets won't actually
01:35:05.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m05s

be anything like image net you know
01:35:07.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m07s

it'll be it'll be medical imaging it'll
01:35:10.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m10s

be like classifying different kinds of
01:35:14.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m14s

steel tube or figuring out whether a
01:35:15.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m15s

world you know is going to break or not
01:35:18.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m18s

or or looking at satellite images or you
01:35:21.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m21s

know whatever right so it's it's good to
01:35:25.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m25s

experiment with stuff like this planet
01:35:30.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m30s

competition to get a sense of kind of
01:35:32.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m32s

what you want to do and so you'll see
01:35:35.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m35s

here I start out by resizing my data to
01:35:37.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m37s

64 by 64 it starts out at 256 by 256
01:35:40.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m40s

right now
01:35:44.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m44s

I wouldn't want to do this for the cats
01:35:46.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m46s

and dogs competition because it cats end
01:35:48.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m48s

on competition we start with a pre
01:35:50.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m50s

trained imagenet Network it's it's
01:35:52.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m52s

nearly isn't it starts off nearly
01:35:54.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m54s

perfect right so if we resized
01:35:57.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m57s

everything to 64 by 64 and then
01:36:00.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m00s

retrained the whole set regular it we'd
01:36:02.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m02s

basically destroy the weights that are
01:36:04.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m04s

already pre trained to be very good
01:36:07.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m07s

remember imagenet most imagenet models
01:36:09.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m09s

are trained at either 224 by 224 or
01:36:12.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m12s

$2.99 by 299 all right so if we like
01:36:14.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m14s

retrain them at 64 by 64 we're going to
01:36:17.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m17s

we're going to kill it on the other hand
01:36:20.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m20s

there's nothing in image net that looks
01:36:23.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m23s

anything like this you know there's no
01:36:25.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m25s

satellite images so the only useful bits
01:36:28.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m28s

of the image net Network for us are kind
01:36:31.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m31s

of layers like this one you know finding
01:36:36.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m36s

edges and gradients and this one you
01:36:39.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m39s

know finding kind of textures and
01:36:42.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m42s

repeating patterns and maybe these ones
01:36:44.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m44s

are kind of finding more complex
01:36:48.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m48s

textures but that's probably about it
01:36:49.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m49s

right so so in other words you know
01:36:52.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m52s

starting out by training very small
01:36:57.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m57s

images works pretty well when you're
01:37:00.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m00s

using stuff like satellites so in this
01:37:02.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m02s

case I started right back at 64 by 64
01:37:04.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m04s

grab some data built my model found out
01:37:07.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m07s

what learning rate to use and
01:37:13.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m13s

interestingly it turned out to be quite
01:37:15.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m15s

high it seems that because like it's so
01:37:17.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m17s

unlike imagenet I needed to do quite a
01:37:22.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m22s

bit more fitting with just that last
01:37:25.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m25s

layer before it started to flatten out
01:37:28.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m28s

then I unfreeze dit and again this is
01:37:30.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m30s

the difference to image net like
01:37:33.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m33s

datasets is my learning rate in the
01:37:38.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m38s

initial layer i set 2/9 the middle
01:37:41.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m41s

layers I said 2/3 where else for stuff
01:37:44.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m44s

like it's like image net I had a
01:37:47.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m47s

multiple of 10 each of those you know
01:37:48.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m48s

again the idea being that that earlier
01:37:52.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m52s

layers probably and not as close to what
01:37:54.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m54s

they need to be compared to the
01:37:58.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m58s

like dances again
01:38:00.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m00s

unfreeze train for a while and you can
01:38:04.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m04s

kind of see here
01:38:08.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m08s

you know there's cycle one there's cycle
01:38:09.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m09s

- there's cycle three and then I kind of
01:38:11.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m11s

increased double the size with my images
01:38:14.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m14s

fit for a while and freeze fit for a
01:38:18.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m18s

while double the size of the images
01:38:21.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m21s

again fit for a while I'm freeze for a
01:38:23.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m23s

while and then add TTA and so as I
01:38:25.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m25s

mentioned last time we looked at this
01:38:28.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m28s

this process ends up you know getting us
01:38:30.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m30s

about 30th place in this competition
01:38:32.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m32s

which is really cool because people you
01:38:35.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m35s

know a lot of very very smart people
01:38:38.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m38s

just a few months ago worked very very
01:38:39.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m39s

hard on this competition a couple of
01:38:42.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m42s

things people have asked about one is
01:38:46.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m46s

what is this data dot resize do so a
01:38:51.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m51s

couple of different pieces here the
01:38:57.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m57s

first is that when we say back here what
01:38:59.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m59s

transforms do we apply and here's our
01:39:05.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m05s

transforms we actually pass in a size
01:39:07.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m07s

right so one of the things that that one
01:39:10.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m10s

of the things that data loaded does is
01:39:12.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m12s

to resize the images like on-demand
01:39:14.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m14s

every time it sees them
01:39:17.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m17s

it's got nothing to do with that dot
01:39:21.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m21s

resize method right so this is this is
01:39:22.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m22s

the thing that happens at the end like
01:39:25.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m25s

whatever's passed in before it hits out
01:39:27.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m27s

that before our data loader spits it out
01:39:29.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m29s

it's going to resize it to this size if
01:39:31.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m31s

the initial input is like a thousand by
01:39:35.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m35s

a thousand reading that JPEG and
01:39:38.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m38s

resizing it to 64 by 64 turns out to
01:39:41.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m41s

actually take more time than training
01:39:45.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m45s

the content that's for each batch all
01:39:48.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m48s

right so basically all resize does is it
01:39:51.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m51s

says hey I'm not going to be using any
01:39:55.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m55s

images bigger than size times 1.3 so
01:39:57.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m57s

just grow through once and create new
01:40:01.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m01s

JPEGs of this size right and they're
01:40:03.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m03s

rectangular right so new JPEGs where the
01:40:08.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m08s

smallest edges of this size and again
01:40:10.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m10s

it's like you never have to do this
01:40:14.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m14s

there's no reason to ever use it if you
01:40:16.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m16s

don't want to it's just a speed-up okay
01:40:19.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m19s

but if you've got really big images
01:40:21.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m21s

coming in it saves you a lot of time and
01:40:23.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m23s

you'll often see on like Carol kernels
01:40:25.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m25s

or forum posts or whatever people will
01:40:27.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m27s

have like bash script stuff like that -
01:40:30.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m30s

like loop through and resize images to
01:40:34.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m34s

save time you never have to do that
01:40:36.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m36s

right just you can just say dot resize
01:40:38.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m38s

and it'll just create you know once-off
01:40:40.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m40s

it'll go through and create that if it's
01:40:44.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m44s

already there and it'll use the
01:40:46.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m46s

criticized ones for you okay so it's
01:40:48.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m48s

just it's just a speed up convenience
01:40:51.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m51s

function no more okay so for those of
01:40:53.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m53s

you that are kind of past dog breeds I
01:41:00.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m00s

would be looking at planet next you know
01:41:05.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m05s

like try it like play around with with
01:41:09.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m09s

trying to get a sense of like how can
01:41:13.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m13s

you get this as an accurate model one
01:41:15.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m15s

thing to mention and I'm not really
01:41:19.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m19s

going to go into it in details there's
01:41:20.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m20s

nothing to do with deep learning
01:41:21.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m21s

particularly is that I'm using a
01:41:22.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m22s

different metric I didn't use metrics
01:41:24.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m24s

equals accuracy but I said metrics
01:41:26.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m26s

equals f2
01:41:29.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m29s

remember from last week that confusion
01:41:33.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m33s

matrix that like two by two you know
01:41:37.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m37s

correct incorrect for each of dogs and
01:41:39.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m39s

cats there's a lot of different ways you
01:41:41.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m41s

could turn that confusion matrix into a
01:41:47.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m47s

score you know do you care more about
01:41:48.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m48s

false negatives or do you care more
01:41:51.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m51s

about false positives and how do you
01:41:52.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m52s

weight them and how do you combine them
01:41:54.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m54s

together right there's a basic there's
01:41:55.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m55s

basically a function called F beta where
01:41:59.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m59s

the beta says how much do you weight
01:42:02.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m02s

false negatives versus false positives
01:42:04.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m04s

and so f 2 is f beta with beta equals 2
01:42:06.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m06s

and it's basically as particular way of
01:42:11.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m11s

weighting false negatives and false
01:42:13.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m13s

positives and the reason we use it is
01:42:15.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m15s

because cattle told us that planet who
01:42:17.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m17s

are running this competition wanted to
01:42:19.700
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m19s

use this particular F beta metric the
01:42:21.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m21s

important thing for you to know is that
01:42:26.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m26s

you can create custom metrics so in this
01:42:28.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m28s

case you can see here it says from
01:42:32.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m32s

Planet import f2 and really I've got
01:42:33.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m33s

this here so that you can see how to do
01:42:35.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m35s

it right so if you look inside courses
01:42:38.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m38s

DL 1 you can see there's something
01:42:43.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m43s

called planet py right and so if I look
01:42:47.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m47s

at planet py you'll see there's a
01:42:51.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m51s

function there called
01:42:55.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m55s

f2 right and so f2 simply calls F beta
01:42:57.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m57s

score from psychic or side PI and patent
01:43:03.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m03s

where it came from and does a couple
01:43:08.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m08s

little tweets that are particularly
01:43:12.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m12s

important but the important thing is
01:43:13.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m13s

like you can write any metric you like
01:43:17.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m17s

right as long as it takes in set of
01:43:19.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m19s

predictions and a set of targets and
01:43:23.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m23s

they're both going to be numpy arrays
01:43:25.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m25s

one dimensional non pyros and then you
01:43:27.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m27s

return back a number okay and so as long
01:43:30.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m30s

as you put a function that takes two
01:43:33.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m33s

vectors and returns at number you can
01:43:35.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m35s

call it as a metric and so then when we
01:43:38.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m38s

said
01:43:41.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m41s

see here learn metrics equals and then
01:43:46.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m46s

past in that array which just contains a
01:43:52.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m52s

single function f2 then it's just going
01:43:54.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m54s

to be printed out after every for you
01:43:57.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m57s

okay so in general like the the faster I
01:44:00.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m00s

library everything is customizable so
01:44:03.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m03s

kind of the idea is that everything is
01:44:06.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m06s

everything is kind of gives you what you
01:44:11.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m11s

might want by default but also
01:44:15.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m15s

everything can be changed as well yes
01:44:18.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m18s

you know um we have a little confusion
01:44:23.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m23s

about the difference between multi-label
01:44:26.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m26s

and a single label uh-huh
01:44:30.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m30s

the vanish as an example in which
01:44:32.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m32s

compared like similarly the example they
01:44:34.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m34s

just show us ah activation function yeah
01:44:38.140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m38s

so so I'm so sorry I said I'd do that
01:44:42.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m42s

then I didn't so the activation the
01:44:47.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m47s

output activation function for a single
01:44:49.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m49s

label classification is softmax but all
01:44:52.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m52s

the reasons that we talked today but if
01:44:55.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m55s

we were trying to predict something that
01:44:58.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m58s

was like 0 0 1 1 0 then softmax would be
01:45:00.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m00s

a terrible choice because it's very hard
01:45:05.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m05s

to come up with something where both of
01:45:07.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m07s

these are high in fact it's impossible
01:45:09.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m09s

because they have to add up to 1 so the
01:45:11.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m11s

closest they could be would be point 5
01:45:13.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m13s

so for multi-label classification our
01:45:15.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m15s

activation function is called sigmoid ok
01:45:19.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m19s

and again the faster library does this
01:45:23.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m23s

automatically for you if it notices you
01:45:26.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m26s

have a multi label problem and it does
01:45:28.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m28s

that by checking your data tip to see if
01:45:32.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m32s

anything has more than one label applied
01:45:34.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m34s

to it and so sigmoid is a function which
01:45:36.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m36s

is equal to it's basically the same
01:45:40.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m40s

thing except rather than we never add up
01:45:44.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m44s

all of these X but instead we just take
01:45:48.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m48s

this X when we say it's just equal to it
01:45:52.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m52s

divided by one plus
01:45:55.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m55s

it and so the nice thing about that is
01:45:59.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m59s

that now like multiple things can be
01:46:05.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m05s

high at once right and so generally then
01:46:09.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m09s

if something is less than zero its
01:46:15.439
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m15s

sigmoid is going to be less than 0.5 if
01:46:18.589
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m18s

it's greater than zero is signal it's
01:46:21.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m21s

going to be greater than 0.5 and so the
01:46:23.089
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m23s

important thing to know about a sigmoid
01:46:26.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m26s

function is that its shape is
01:46:27.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m27s

something which asymptotes at the top to
01:46:36.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m36s

one and asymptotes drew
01:46:39.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m39s

asymptotes at the bottom to zero and so
01:46:45.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m45s

therefore it's a good thing to model a
01:46:52.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m52s

probability with anybody who has done
01:46:53.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m53s

any logistic regression will be familiar
01:46:57.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m57s

with this is what we do in logistic
01:47:01.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m01s

regression so it kind of appears
01:47:03.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m03s

everywhere in machine learning and
01:47:05.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m05s

you'll see that kind of a sigmoid and a
01:47:06.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m06s

softmax they're very close to each other
01:47:08.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m08s

conceptually but this is what we want is
01:47:12.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m12s

our activation function for multi-label
01:47:15.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m15s

and this is what we want the single
01:47:18.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m18s

label and again first AI does it all for
01:47:19.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m19s

you
01:47:22.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m22s

there was a question over here yes I
01:47:22.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m22s

have a question about the initial
01:47:31.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m31s

training that you do if I understand
01:47:34.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m34s

correctly you have we have frozen the
01:47:35.979
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m35s

the premium model and you only need
01:47:39.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m39s

initially try to train the latest
01:47:42.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m42s

playwright right but from the other hand
01:47:46.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m46s

we said that only the initial layer so
01:47:50.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m50s

let's last probably the first layer is
01:47:53.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m53s

like important to us and the other two
01:47:55.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m55s

are more like features that are you must
01:47:58.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m58s

not related and we then apply in this
01:48:01.599
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m01s

case what that they the lie is a very
01:48:03.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m03s

important but the pre-trained weights in
01:48:07.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m07s

them aren't so it's the later layers
01:48:10.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m10s

that we really want to train the most so
01:48:13.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m13s

earlier layers likely to be like already
01:48:16.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m16s

closer to what we want okay so you
01:48:20.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m20s

started with the latest one and then you
01:48:23.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m23s

go right so if you go back to our quick
01:48:25.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m25s

dogs and cats right when we create a
01:48:27.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m27s

model from pre train from a pre train
01:48:31.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m31s

model it returns something where all of
01:48:33.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m33s

the convolutional layers are frozen and
01:48:36.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m36s

some randomly set fully connected layers
01:48:38.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m38s

we add to the end our unfrozen and so
01:48:42.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m42s

when we go fit at first it just trains
01:48:46.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m46s

the randomly set a randomly initialized
01:48:50.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m50s

fully connected letters right
01:48:53.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m53s

and if something is like really close to
01:48:56.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m56s

imagenet that's often all we need
01:48:59.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m59s

but because the early early layers are
01:49:02.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m02s

already good at finding edges gradients
01:49:04.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m04s

repeating patterns for ears and dogs
01:49:08.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m08s

heads you know so then when we unfreeze
01:49:11.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m11s

we set the learning rates for the early
01:49:16.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m16s

layers to be really low because we don't
01:49:19.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m19s

want to change the mesh for us the later
01:49:22.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m22s

ones we set them to be higher where else
01:49:25.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m25s

for satellite data right this is no
01:49:28.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m28s

longer true you know the early layers
01:49:32.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m32s

are still like better than the later
01:49:34.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m34s

layers but we still probably need to
01:49:37.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m37s

change them quite a bit so that's right
01:49:40.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m40s

this learning rate is nine times smaller
01:49:42.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m42s

than the final learning rate rather than
01:49:45.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m45s

a thousand times smaller the final loan
01:49:48.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m48s

rate okay you play with with the weights
01:49:52.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m52s

of the layers yeah normally most of the
01:49:55.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m55s

stuff you see online if they talk about
01:50:00.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m00s

this at all they'll talk about
01:50:01.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m01s

unfreezing different subsets of layers
01:50:03.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m03s

and indeed we do unfreeze our randomly
01:50:07.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m07s

generated runs but what I found is
01:50:10.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m10s

although the first layer library you can
01:50:13.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m13s

type learn dot freeze too and just
01:50:16.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m16s

freeze a subset of layers this approach
01:50:18.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m18s

of using differential learning rates
01:50:20.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m20s

seems to be like more flexible to the
01:50:22.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m22s

point that I never find myself I'm
01:50:26.350
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m26s

freezing subsets of layers that I would
01:50:28.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m28s

expect you to start with that with a
01:50:32.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m32s

different cell the different learning
01:50:34.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m34s

rates rather than trying to learn the
01:50:37.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m37s

last layer so the reason okay so you
01:50:40.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m40s

could skip this training just the last
01:50:43.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m43s

layers and just go straight to
01:50:48.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m48s

differential learning rates but you
01:50:49.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m49s

probably don't want to and the reason
01:50:52.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m52s

you probably don't want to is that
01:50:53.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m53s

there's a difference the convolutional
01:50:55.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m55s

layers all contain pre-trained weights
01:50:57.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m57s

so they're like they're not random for
01:51:00.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m00s

things that are close to imagenet
01:51:03.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m03s

they're actually really good for things
01:51:05.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m05s

that are not close to imagenet they're
01:51:07.060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m07s

better than that
01:51:09.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m09s

all of our fully connected layers
01:51:10.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m10s

however are totally random so therefore
01:51:13.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m13s

you would always want to make the fully
01:51:17.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m17s

connected weights better than random by
01:51:19.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m19s

training them a bit first because
01:51:21.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m21s

otherwise if you go straight to unfreeze
01:51:24.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m24s

then you're actually going to be like
01:51:26.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m26s

fiddling around of those early early can
01:51:28.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m28s

early layer weights when the later ones
01:51:31.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m31s

are still random that's probably not
01:51:34.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m34s

what you want I think that's another
01:51:35.809
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m35s

question here any possible so when we
01:51:37.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m37s

unfreeze what are the things we're
01:51:41.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m41s

trying to change there will it change
01:51:46.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m46s

the Colonel's themselves that that's
01:51:50.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m50s

always what SGD does yeah so the only
01:51:54.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m54s

thing what training means is setting
01:51:57.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m57s

these numbers right and these numbers
01:52:02.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m02s

and these numbers the weights so the
01:52:09.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m09s

weights are the weights of the fully
01:52:18.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m18s

connected layers and the weights in
01:52:19.699
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m19s

those kernels and the convolutions so
01:52:22.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m22s

that's what training means it's and
01:52:24.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m24s

we'll learn about how to do it with SGD
01:52:27.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m27s

but training literally is setting those
01:52:29.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m29s

numbers these numbers on the other hand
01:52:32.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m32s

are activations they're calculated
01:52:34.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m34s

they're calculated from the weights and
01:52:38.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m38s

the previous layers activations or
01:52:41.329
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m41s

amounts of questions so you can lift it
01:52:44.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m44s

up higher and speak badly so in your
01:52:49.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m49s

example of a cheerleader set of that
01:52:51.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m51s

English example so you start with very
01:52:52.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m52s

small size existed for yeah so does it
01:52:55.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m55s

literally mean you know the model takes
01:52:58.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m58s

a small area from the entire image that
01:53:00.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m00s

is 64 bytes so how do we get that 64 by
01:53:03.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m03s

64 depends on the transforms by default
01:53:08.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m08s

our transform takes the smallest edge
01:53:13.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m13s

and recites the whole thing out
01:53:18.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m18s

samples it so the smallest edge is
01:53:22.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m22s

societics t4 and then it takes a Center
01:53:24.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m24s

crop of that okay
01:53:27.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m27s

although when we're using data
01:53:29.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m29s

augmentation it actually takes a
01:53:33.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m33s

randomly chosen prop ie the case where
01:53:35.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m35s

the image ties to multiple objects don't
01:53:40.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m40s

in this case like would it be possible
01:53:43.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m43s

that you would just lose the other
01:53:46.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m46s

things that they try to predict yeah
01:53:48.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m48s

which is why data augmentation is
01:53:50.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m50s

important so by by and particularly
01:53:51.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m51s

their test time augmentation is going to
01:53:54.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m54s

be particularly important because you
01:53:57.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m57s

would you wouldn't want to you know that
01:53:59.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m59s

there may be a artisanal mine out in the
01:54:00.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m00s

corner which if you take a center crop
01:54:03.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m03s

you you don't see so data augmentation
01:54:06.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m06s

becomes very important yeah so when we
01:54:08.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m08s

talk on their tributaries are he
01:54:15.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m15s

receiver up to that's not really what a
01:54:17.499
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m17s

model choice Delton that's a great point
01:54:21.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m21s

that's not the loss function yeah right
01:54:23.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m23s

the loss function is something we'll be
01:54:25.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m25s

learning about next week and it uses
01:54:27.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m27s

cross entropy or otherwise known as like
01:54:30.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m30s

negative log likelihood the metric is
01:54:33.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m33s

just this thing that's printed so we can
01:54:37.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m37s

see what's going on just next to that so
01:54:39.249
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m39s

in the context of my deep pass modeling
01:54:43.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m43s

cannot change data does it trading it
01:54:47.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m47s

also have to be multiplied so can I
01:54:49.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m49s

train on just like images of pure cats
01:54:51.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m51s

and dogs and expect it at prediction
01:54:53.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m53s

time to predict if I give it a picture
01:54:54.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m54s

of both having cat eye on it over I've
01:54:57.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m57s

never tried that and I've never seen an
01:55:04.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m04s

example of something that needed it
01:55:06.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m06s

I guess conceptually there's no reason
01:55:08.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m08s

it wouldn't work but it's kind of out
01:55:11.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m11s

there and you still use a sigmoid you
01:55:14.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m14s

would have to make sure you're using a
01:55:18.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m18s

sigmoid loss function so in this case
01:55:19.389
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m19s

faster eyes default would not work
01:55:20.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m20s

because by default first day I would say
01:55:22.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m22s

your training data knitter has both a
01:55:24.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m24s

cat and the dog so you would have to
01:55:26.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m26s

override the loss function
01:55:28.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m28s

when you use the differential learning
01:55:35.349
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m35s

rates those three learning rates do they
01:55:37.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m37s

just kind of spread evenly across the
01:55:40.729
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m40s

layers yeah we'll talk more about this
01:55:42.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m42s

later in the course but I mean the
01:55:46.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m46s

faster I library there's a concept of
01:55:48.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m48s

layer groups so in something like a
01:55:50.689
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m50s

resonant 50 you know there's hundreds of
01:55:53.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m53s

layers and I think it you don't want to
01:55:55.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m55s

write down hundreds of learning rates so
01:55:57.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m57s

I've basically decided for you how to
01:56:00.709
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m00s

split them and the the last one always
01:56:03.679
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m03s

refers just to the fully connected
01:56:07.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m07s

layers that we've randomly initialized
01:56:10.219
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m10s

and edit to the end and then these ones
01:56:12.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m12s

are split generally about halfway
01:56:14.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m14s

through basically I've tried to make it
01:56:16.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m16s

so that these you know these ones are
01:56:19.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m19s

kind of the ones which you hardly want
01:56:22.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m22s

to change at all and these are the ones
01:56:24.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m24s

you might want to change a little bit
01:56:25.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m25s

and I don't think we're covered in the
01:56:26.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m26s

course but if you're interested we can
01:56:29.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m29s

talk about in the forum there are ways
01:56:30.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m30s

you can override this behavior to define
01:56:31.939
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m31s

your own layer groups if you want to and
01:56:33.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m33s

is there any way to visualize the model
01:56:36.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m36s

easily or like don't dump the layers of
01:56:38.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m38s

the model yeah absolutely
01:56:41.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m41s

you can let's make sure we've got one
01:56:43.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m43s

here okay so if you just type learn it
01:56:47.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m47s

doesn't tell you much at all but what
01:56:54.229
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m54s

you can do is go learn summary and that
01:56:55.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m55s

spits out basically everything there's
01:57:02.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m02s

all the letters and so you can see in
01:57:07.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m07s

this case these are the names I
01:57:09.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m09s

mentioned how they look up names right
01:57:13.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m13s

so the first layer is called con 2 d 1
01:57:14.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m14s

and it's going to take as input this is
01:57:17.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m17s

useful to actually look at it's taking
01:57:21.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m21s

64 by 64 images which is what we told it
01:57:24.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m24s

we're going to transform things to this
01:57:27.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m27s

is three channels high torch like most
01:57:28.999
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m28s

things have channels at the end would
01:57:33.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m33s

say 64 by 64 by 3 ply torch music to the
01:57:35.209
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m35s

front so it's 3 by 64 by 64 that's
01:57:38.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m38s

because it turns out that some of the
01:57:41.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m41s

GPU computations run faster when it
01:57:44.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m44s

in that order okay but that happens all
01:57:46.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m46s

behind-the-scenes automatic plays a part
01:57:49.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m49s

of that transformation stuff that's kind
01:57:50.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m50s

of all done automatically is to do that
01:57:53.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m53s

minus one means however however big the
01:57:56.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m56s

batch size is in care us they use the
01:58:00.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m00s

number they use a special number none in
01:58:04.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m04s

pile types that used minus one so this
01:58:07.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m07s

is a four dimensional mini batch the
01:58:09.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m09s

number of elements in the amount of
01:58:13.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m13s

images in the mini batch is dynamic you
01:58:15.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m15s

can change that the number of channels
01:58:18.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m18s

is three number which is a 64 by 64 okay
01:58:20.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m20s

and so then you can basically see that
01:58:23.660
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m23s

this particular convolutional kernel
01:58:26.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m26s

apparently has 64 kernels in it and it's
01:58:29.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m29s

also having we haven't talked about this
01:58:32.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m32s

but convolutions can have something
01:58:35.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m35s

called a stride that is like Matt pullin
01:58:36.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m36s

it changes the size so it's returning a
01:58:39.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m39s

32 by 32 564 kernel tenza and so on and
01:58:41.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m41s

so forth so that's summary and we'll
01:58:47.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m47s

learn all about that's doing in detail
01:58:51.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m51s

on in the second half of the course one
01:58:54.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m54s

where I clicked in my own data set and I
01:58:57.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m57s

try to use the in as a really small data
01:59:00.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m00s

set these currencies from Google Images
01:59:02.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m02s

and I tried to do a learning rate find
01:59:06.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m06s

and then the plot and it just it gave me
01:59:09.470
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m09s

some numbers which I didn't understand
01:59:12.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m12s

and the learning rate font yeah and then
01:59:14.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m14s

the plot was empty so yeah I mean let's
01:59:15.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m15s

let's talk about that on the forum but
01:59:18.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m18s

basically the learning rate finder is
01:59:20.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m20s

going to go through a mini batch at a
01:59:22.910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m22s

time if you've got a tiny data set
01:59:24.290
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m24s

there's just not enough mini batches so
01:59:26.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m26s

the trick is to make your mini bit make
01:59:28.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m28s

your batch size really small like try
01:59:30.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m30s

making it like four
01:59:32.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m32s

okay they were great questions it's not
01:59:38.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m38s

nothing online to add you know they were
01:59:40.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m40s

great questions we've got a little bit
01:59:44.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m44s

past where I hope to but let's let's
01:59:45.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m45s

quickly talk about structured data so we
01:59:48.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m48s

can start thinking about it for next
01:59:51.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m51s

week so this is really weird right to me
01:59:52.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m52s

there's basically two types of data set
01:59:59.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m59s

we use in machine learning there's a
02:00:02.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m02s

type of data like audio images natural
02:00:04.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m04s

language text where all of the all of
02:00:10.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m10s

the things inside an object like all of
02:00:14.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m14s

the pixels inside an image are all the
02:00:16.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m16s

same kind of thing they're all pixels or
02:00:18.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m18s

they're all apertures of a waveform or
02:00:21.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m21s

they're all words I call this kind of
02:00:26.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m26s

data unstructured and then there's data
02:00:30.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m30s

sets like a profit and loss statement or
02:00:33.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m33s

the information about a Facebook user
02:00:37.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m37s

where each column is like structurally
02:00:39.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m39s

quite different you know one thing is
02:00:43.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m43s

representing like how many page views
02:00:45.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m45s

last month another one is their sex
02:00:47.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m47s

another one is what zip code they're in
02:00:49.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m49s

and I call this structure there that
02:00:51.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m51s

particular terminology is not unusual
02:00:55.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m55s

like lots of people use that terminology
02:00:57.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m57s

but lots of people don't
02:01:00.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m00s

there's no particularly agreed-upon
02:01:02.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m02s

terminology so when I say structured
02:01:05.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m05s

data I'm referring to kind of columnar
02:01:08.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m08s

data as you might find in a database or
02:01:11.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m11s

a spreadsheet where different columns
02:01:14.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m14s

represent different kinds of things and
02:01:16.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m16s

each row represents an observation and
02:01:19.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m19s

so structured data is probably what most
02:01:21.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m21s

of you are analyzing most of the time
02:01:25.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m25s

funnily enough you know academics in the
02:01:31.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m31s

deep learning world don't really give a
02:01:34.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m34s

 about structured data because it's
02:01:37.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m37s

pretty hard to get published in fancy
02:01:39.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m39s

conference proceedings if you're like if
02:01:41.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m41s

you've got a better logistics model you
02:01:44.260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m44s

know it's the thing that makes the world
02:01:46.179
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m46s

goes round it's a thing that makes
02:01:47.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m47s

everybody you know
02:01:49.719
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m49s

and efficiency and make stuff work but
02:01:51.139
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m51s

it's largely ignored sadly so we're not
02:01:55.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m55s

going to ignore it because we're a
02:02:00.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m00s

practical deep learning and cackled
02:02:01.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m01s

doesn't ignore it either because people
02:02:04.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m04s

put prize money up on Cagle to solve
02:02:05.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m05s

real-world problems so there are some
02:02:08.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m08s

great capable competitions we can look
02:02:10.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m10s

at there's one running right now which
02:02:11.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m11s

is the grocery sales forecasting
02:02:14.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m14s

competition for Ecuador's largest chain
02:02:16.519
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m16s

it's always a little I've got to be a
02:02:21.399
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m21s

little careful about how much I show you
02:02:24.559
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m24s

about currently running competitions
02:02:26.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m26s

because I don't want to you know help
02:02:28.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m28s

you cheat but it so happens there was a
02:02:29.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m29s

competition a year or two ago for one of
02:02:32.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m32s

Germany's magistrate chains which is
02:02:35.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m35s

almost identical so I'm going to show
02:02:38.269
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m38s

you how to do that so that was called
02:02:40.099
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m40s

the Rossman stores data and so I would
02:02:45.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m45s

suggest you know first of all try
02:02:50.539
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m50s

practicing what we're learning on
02:02:52.489
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m52s

Russman right but then see if you can
02:02:53.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m53s

get it working on on grocery because
02:02:56.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m56s

currently on the leaderboard no one
02:02:58.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m58s

seems to basically know what they're
02:03:02.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m02s

doing in the groceries competition if
02:03:03.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m03s

you look at the leaderboard the let's
02:03:05.149
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m05s

see here yeah these ones around 5 to 9 v
02:03:10.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m10s

3o are people that are literally finding
02:03:13.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m13s

like group averages and submitting those
02:03:15.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m15s

I know because they're kernels that
02:03:18.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m18s

they're using so you know the basically
02:03:19.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m19s

the people around 20th place are not
02:03:22.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m22s

actually doing any machine learning so
02:03:24.369
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m24s

yeah let's see if we can improve things
02:03:29.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m29s

so you'll see there's a less than 3
02:03:31.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m31s

rossmann notebook sure you get pull ok
02:03:34.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m34s

in fact you know just reminder you know
02:03:38.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m38s

before you start working get pull in
02:03:40.189
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m40s

you're faster a repo and from time to
02:03:42.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m42s

time Condor and update for you guys
02:03:45.289
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m45s

during the in-person course the Condor
02:03:48.889
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m48s

and update you should do it more often
02:03:51.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m51s

because we're kind of changing things a
02:03:52.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m52s

little bit um folks in the MOOC you know
02:03:55.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m55s

more like once a month should be fine
02:03:57.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m57s

so anyway I just just changed this a
02:04:01.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m01s

little bit so make sure you get Paul to
02:04:04.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m04s

get lesson 3 Rossman and there's a
02:04:05.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m05s

couple of new libraries here one is fast
02:04:09.560
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m09s

AI dot structure faster guided
02:04:11.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m11s

structured contain stuff which is
02:04:14.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m14s

actually not at all high torch specific
02:04:16.370
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m16s

and we actually use that in the machine
02:04:18.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m18s

learning course as well for doing random
02:04:20.600
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m20s

forests with no tie torch at all I
02:04:23.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m23s

mentioned that because you can use that
02:04:25.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m25s

particular library without any of the
02:04:27.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m27s

other parts of fast AI so that can be
02:04:30.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m30s

handy and then we're also going to use
02:04:33.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m33s

faster column data which is basically
02:04:36.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m36s

some stuff that allows us to do fast a
02:04:39.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m39s

type a torch stuff with columnar
02:04:41.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m41s

structured data for structured data we
02:04:44.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m44s

need to use pandas a lot anybody who's
02:04:49.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m49s

used our data frames will be very
02:04:52.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m52s

familiar with pandas pandas is basically
02:04:54.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m54s

an attempt to kind of replicate data
02:04:56.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m56s

friends in Python you know and a bit
02:04:59.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m59s

more if you're not entirely familiar
02:05:03.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m03s

with pandas there's a great book
02:05:08.240
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m08s

[Music]
02:05:14.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m14s

which I think I might have mentioned
02:05:16.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m16s

before - for data analysis by Wes
02:05:18.020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m18s

McKinney there's a new addition that
02:05:23.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m23s

just came out a couple of weeks ago
02:05:24.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m24s

obviously being by the pandas author its
02:05:27.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m27s

coverage of pandas is excellent but it
02:05:30.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m30s

also covers numpy scipy matplotlib
02:05:32.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m32s

scikit-learn - and Jupiter really well
02:05:37.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m37s

okay and so I'm kind of going to assume
02:05:42.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m42s

that you know your way around these
02:05:45.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m45s

libraries to some extent also there was
02:05:48.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m48s

the workshop we did before they started
02:05:52.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m52s

and there's a video of that online where
02:05:54.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m54s

we kind of have a brief mention of all
02:05:56.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m56s

of those tools structured data is
02:05:59.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m59s

generally shared as CSV files it was no
02:06:03.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m03s

different in this competition as you'll
02:06:06.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m06s

see there's a hyperlink to the rustman
02:06:08.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m08s

data set here right now if you look at
02:06:10.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m10s

the bottom of my screen you'll see this
02:06:14.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m14s

goes to file start faster day.i because
02:06:15.500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m15s

this doesn't require any login or
02:06:17.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m17s

anything to grab this data set it's as
02:06:19.579
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m19s

simple as right clicking copy link
02:06:21.980
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m21s

address head over to wherever you want
02:06:24.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m24s

it and just type W get and the URL okay
02:06:26.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m26s

so that's because you know it's it's not
02:06:36.159
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m36s

behind a login or anything so you can
02:06:40.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m40s

grab the grab it from there and you can
02:06:44.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m44s

always read a CSV file with just pandas
02:06:47.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m47s

don't read CSV now in this particular
02:06:49.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m49s

case there's a lot of pre-processing
02:06:52.040
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m52s

that we do and what I've actually done
02:06:55.639
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m55s

here is I've I've actually stolen the
02:06:57.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m57s

entire pipeline from the third place
02:07:03.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m03s

winner roster okay so they made all
02:07:06.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m06s

their data they're really great you know
02:07:08.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m08s

they better get hub available with
02:07:11.119
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m11s

everything that we need and I've ported
02:07:12.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m12s

it all across and simplified it and
02:07:14.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m14s

tried to make it pretty easy to
02:07:16.880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m16s

understand this course is about deep
02:07:18.829
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m18s

learning not about data processing so
02:07:23.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m23s

I'm not going to go through it but we
02:07:25.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m25s

will be going through it in the machine
02:07:28.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m28s

learning course
02:07:29.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m29s

in some detail because feature
02:07:30.840
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m30s

engineering is really important so if
02:07:32.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m32s

you're interested you know check out the
02:07:34.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m34s

machine learning course for that I will
02:07:37.110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m37s

however show you kind of what it looks
02:07:41.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m41s

like so once we read the CSV Xin you can
02:07:44.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m44s

see basically what's there so the key
02:07:48.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m48s

one is for a particular store we have
02:07:50.909
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m50s

the
02:08:01.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m01s

we have the date and we have the sales
02:08:05.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m05s

for that particular store we know
02:08:09.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m09s

whether that thing is on promo or not we
02:08:12.270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m12s

know the number of customers at that
02:08:18.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m18s

particular store had we know whether
02:08:19.860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m19s

that date was a school holiday
02:08:23.429
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m23s

we also know what kind of store it is so
02:08:29.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m29s

this is pretty common right you'll often
02:08:36.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m36s

get datasets where there's some column
02:08:38.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m38s

with like just some kind of code we
02:08:41.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m41s

don't really know what the code means
02:08:43.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m43s

and most of the time I find it doesn't
02:08:44.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m44s

matter what it means like normally you
02:08:47.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m47s

get given a data dictionary when you
02:08:49.450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m49s

start on a project and obviously if
02:08:51.760
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m51s

you're working on an internal project
02:08:53.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m53s

you can ask the people at your company
02:08:54.550
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m54s

what does this column mean I kind of
02:08:56.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m56s

stay away from learning too much about
02:08:59.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m59s

it I prefer to like to see what the data
02:09:01.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m01s

says first there's something about what
02:09:03.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m03s

kind of product are we selling in this
02:09:08.080
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m08s

particular row
02:09:10.210
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m10s

and then there's information about like
02:09:13.989
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m13s

how far away is the nearest competitor
02:09:16.230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m16s

how long have they been open for how
02:09:19.239
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m19s

long is the promo being on for for each
02:09:24.820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m24s

store we can find out what state it's in
02:09:31.120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m31s

for each state we can find at the name
02:09:32.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m32s

of the state this is in Germany and
02:09:35.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m35s

interestingly they were allowed to
02:09:38.670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m38s

download any data external data they
02:09:40.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m40s

wanted in this competition just very
02:09:42.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m42s

common as long as you share it with
02:09:44.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m44s

everybody else and so some folks tried
02:09:46.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m46s

downloading data from Google Trends I'm
02:09:48.520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m48s

not sure exactly what it was that they
02:09:53.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m53s

would check in the trend off but we have
02:09:55.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m55s

this information from Google Trends
02:09:56.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m56s

somebody downloaded the weather for
02:09:59.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m59s

every day in Germany every state
02:10:01.810
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m01s

and yeah that's about it right so you
02:10:09.250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m09s

can get a data frame summary with pandas
02:10:17.320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m17s

which kind of lets you see how many
02:10:20.710
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m20s

observations and means and standard
02:10:22.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m22s

deviations again I don't do a hell of a
02:10:24.430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m24s

lot with that early on but it's nice to
02:10:27.190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m27s

note there so what we do you know this
02:10:30.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m30s

is called a relational data set a
02:10:34.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m34s

relational data set is one where there's
02:10:35.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m35s

quite a few tables we have to join
02:10:37.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m37s

together it's very easy to do that in
02:10:38.920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m38s

pandas there's a thing called merge so
02:10:41.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m41s

great little function to do that and so
02:10:43.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m43s

I just started joining everything
02:10:45.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m45s

together
02:10:46.360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m46s

joining the weather or the Google Trends
02:10:46.750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m46s

stores yeah that's about everything I
02:10:49.380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m49s

guess you'll see there's one thing that
02:10:57.280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m57s

I'm using from the FASTA a library which
02:10:59.530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m59s

is called add date part we talked about
02:11:02.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m02s

this a lot in the machine learning
02:11:04.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m04s

course but basically this is going to
02:11:06.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m06s

take a date and pull out of a bunch of
02:11:07.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m07s

columns day of week is at the start of a
02:11:10.570
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m10s

quarter month of year so on and so forth
02:11:12.970
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m12s

and add them all in to the dataset okay
02:11:16.000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m16s

so this is all standard pre-processing
02:11:18.460
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m18s

all right so we join everything together
02:11:22.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m22s

we fiddle around with some of the dates
02:11:24.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m24s

a little bit some of them are in month
02:11:26.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m26s

in year format we turn it into date
02:11:28.330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m28s

format we spend a lot of time trying to
02:11:29.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m29s

take information about for example
02:11:35.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m35s

holidays and add a column for like how
02:11:37.930
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m37s

long until the next holiday how long has
02:11:40.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m40s

it been since the last holiday ditto for
02:11:42.940
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m42s

promos so on and so forth okay so we do
02:11:45.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m45s

all that and at the very end we
02:11:49.870
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m49s

basically save a big structured data
02:11:52.180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m52s

file that contains all that stuff
02:11:54.610
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m54s

something that those of you that use
02:11:57.630
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m57s

pandas may not be aware of is that
02:11:59.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m59s

there's a very cool new format called
02:12:01.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m01s

feather which you can save a panda's
02:12:03.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m03s

data frame into this feather format it's
02:12:05.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m05s

kind of pretty much takes it as it sits
02:12:08.890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m08s

in RAM and dumps it to the disk and so
02:12:11.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m11s

it's like really really really fast the
02:12:13.960
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m13s

reason that you need to know this is
02:12:16.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m16s

because the ecuadorian grocery
02:12:18.130
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m18s

competition is on now has
02:12:20.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m20s

350 million records so you will care
02:12:22.720
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m22s

about how long things take a talk I
02:12:26.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m26s

believe about six seconds for me to save
02:12:28.420
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m28s

three hundred and fifty million records
02:12:30.850
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m30s

to feather format so that's pretty cool
02:12:32.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m32s

so at the end of all that I'd save it as
02:12:35.010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m35s

a feather format and for the rest of
02:12:37.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m37s

this discussion I'm just going to take
02:12:39.070
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m39s

it as given that we've got this nicely
02:12:40.540
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m40s

pre-processed feature engineered file
02:12:43.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m43s

and I can just go read better okay but
02:12:45.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m45s

for you to play along at home you will
02:12:48.790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m48s

have to run those previous cells oh
02:12:50.650
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m50s

except the see these ones have commented
02:12:53.220
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m53s

out you don't have to run those because
02:12:57.580
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m57s

the file that you download from files
02:12:59.950
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m59s

doc bastard AI has already done that for
02:13:01.690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m01s

you okay all right so we basically have
02:13:03.730
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m03s

all these columns so it basically is
02:13:09.400
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m09s

going to tell us you know how many of
02:13:14.740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m14s

this thing was sold on this date at this
02:13:18.510
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m18s

store and so the goal of this
02:13:23.830
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m23s

competition is to find out how many
02:13:25.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m25s

things will be sold for each store for
02:13:28.990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m28s

each type of thing in the future okay
02:13:32.590
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m32s

and so that's basically what we're going
02:13:36.160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m36s

to be trying to do and so here's an
02:13:38.200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m38s

example of what some of the data looks
02:13:40.900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m40s

like and so next week we're going to see
02:13:42.340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m42s

how to go through these steps but
02:13:48.640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m48s

basically what we're going to learn is
02:13:50.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m50s

we're going to learn to split the
02:13:52.300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m52s

columns into two types some columns were
02:13:55.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m55s

going to treat as categorical which is
02:13:58.480
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m58s

to say store ID one and store ID - I'm
02:14:01.390
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m01s

not numerically related to each other
02:14:06.310
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m06s

they're categories right we're going to
02:14:08.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m08s

treat day of week like that - Monday and
02:14:11.050
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m11s

Tuesday day zero and day one not
02:14:13.150
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m13s

numerically related to each other where
02:14:15.490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m15s

else distance in kilometers to the
02:14:17.800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m17s

nearest competitor that's a number that
02:14:20.620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m20s

we're going to treat numerically right
02:14:24.100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m24s

so in other words the categorical
02:14:26.170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m26s

variables we basically are going to one
02:14:28.090
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m28s

how to encode them you can think of it
02:14:29.770
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m29s

as one hot encoding on where
02:14:32.410
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m32s

the continuous variables we're going to
02:14:34.039
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m34s

be feeding into fully connected layers
02:14:35.839
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m35s

just as is okay so what we'll be doing
02:14:38.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m38s

is we'll be basically creating a
02:14:43.609
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m43s

validation set and you'll see like a lot
02:14:47.199
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m47s

of these are start to look familiar this
02:14:49.849
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m49s

is the same function we used on planet
02:14:51.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m51s

and dog breeds to create a validation
02:14:53.419
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m53s

set there's some stuff that you haven't
02:14:54.739
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m54s

seen before
02:14:58.669
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m58s

where we're going to basically rather
02:14:59.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m59s

than saying image data dot from CSV
02:15:02.899
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m02s

we're going to say columnar data from
02:15:06.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m06s

data frame right so you can see like the
02:15:09.109
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m09s

basic API concepts will be the same but
02:15:11.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m11s

they're a little different right but
02:15:13.780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m13s

just like before we're going to get a
02:15:17.689
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m17s

learner and we're going to go lr find to
02:15:18.919
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m18s

find our best learning rate and then
02:15:23.659
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m23s

we're going to go dot fit with a metric
02:15:26.359
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m26s

with a cycle length okay so the basic
02:15:28.749
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m28s

sequence who's going to end up looking
02:15:33.019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m33s

hopefully very familiar okay so we're
02:15:35.469
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m35s

out of time
02:15:39.079
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m39s

so what I suggest you do this week is
02:15:40.339
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m40s

like try to enter as many capital image
02:15:42.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m42s

competitions as possible like like try
02:15:47.479
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m47s

to really get this feel for like cycling
02:15:49.969
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m49s

learning rates plotting things you know
02:15:53.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m53s

that that post I showed you at the start
02:15:59.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m59s

of class today that kind of took you
02:16:03.949
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m03s

through lesson one like really go
02:16:05.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m05s

through that on as many image datasets
02:16:08.929
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m08s

as you can you just feel really
02:16:11.030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m11s

comfortable with it right because you
02:16:13.789
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m13s

want to get to the point where next week
02:16:17.059
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m17s

when we start talking about structured
02:16:18.409
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m18s

data that this idea of like how learners
02:16:19.879
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m19s

kind of work and data works and data
02:16:22.309
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m22s

loaders and data sets and looking at
02:16:24.619
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m24s

pictures should be really you know
02:16:26.449
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m26s

intuitive all right good luck see you
02:16:28.869
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m28s
