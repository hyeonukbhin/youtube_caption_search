[better understand stuff and also for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m18s)
00:00:18

[to better understand stuff by trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m20s)
00:00:20

[teach what you've learned I just wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m23s)
00:00:23

[to highlight a few i've actually posted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m25s)
00:00:25

[to the wiki thread of a few of these but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m29s)
00:00:29

[there's there's lots more Russian has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m32s)

[introductory tutorials so for example if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m38s)
00:00:38

[you're having any trouble getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m41s)

[step-by-step how to go about logging in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m46s)
00:00:46

[and getting everything working which i](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m49s)
00:00:49

[think is a really terrific thing and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m51s)
00:00:51

[it's a kind of thing that if you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m53s)
00:00:53

[writing some notes for yourself to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m57s)
00:00:57

[remind you how to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h00m59s)
00:00:59

[you may as well post them for others to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m01s)
00:01:01

[do it as well and by using a markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m02s)
00:01:02

[file like this and it's actually good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m05s)
00:01:05

[practice if you haven't used github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m07s)
00:01:07

[before if you put it up on github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m08s)
00:01:08

[everybody can now use it or of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m10s)
00:01:10

[you can just put it in the forum so more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m13s)
00:01:13

[advanced a thing that Reshma wrote up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m17s)
00:01:17

[about is she noticed that I like using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m20s)
00:01:20

[Tmax which is a handy little thing which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m21s)
00:01:21

[lets me lets me basically have a window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m25s)
00:01:25

[I'll show you so as soon as I log into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m30s)
00:01:30

[my computer if I run Tmax you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m33s)
00:01:33

[that all of my windows pop straight up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m38s)
00:01:38

[basically and I can like continue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m39s)
00:01:39

[running stuff in the background and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m42s)
00:01:42

[can like I've got them over here and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m44s)
00:01:44

[can kind of zoom into it or I can move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[over to the top which is here so Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m48s)
00:01:48

[colonel running and so forth so if that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m50s)
00:01:50

[sounds interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m53s)
00:01:53

[Reshma has a tutorial here on how you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m54s)
00:01:54

[can use two maps and it's actually got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h01m57s)
00:01:57

[whole bunch of stuff in her github so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m00s)
00:02:00

[that's that's really cool I built among](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m03s)
00:02:03

[has written a very nice kind of summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m07s)
00:02:07

[basically of our last lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m10s)
00:02:10

[which kind of covers what are the key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m13s)
00:02:13

[things we did and why did we do them so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m17s)
00:02:17

[if you are a kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m19s)
00:02:19

[wondering like how does it fit together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m21s)
00:02:21

[I think this is a really helpful summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m23s)
00:02:23

[like what if those couple of hours look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m25s)
00:02:25

[like if we summarize it all into a page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m28s)
00:02:28

[or two I also really like Pavel has dad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m30s)
00:02:30

[kind of done a deep dive on the learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m38s)
00:02:38

[rate finder which is a topic that a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m40s)
00:02:40

[of you have been interested in learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m45s)
00:02:45

[more about particularly those of you who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[have done deep learning before I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m49s)
00:02:49

[realized that this is like a solution to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m50s)
00:02:50

[a problem that you've been having for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[long time and haven't seen before and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m54s)
00:02:54

[it's kind of something which hasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m55s)
00:02:55

[really been blogged about before so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m57s)
00:02:57

[is the first I've seen it's logged about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h02m59s)
00:02:59

[so when I put this on Twitter a link to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m00s)
00:03:00

[pebbles post it's been shared you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m04s)
00:03:04

[hundreds of times it's been really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m06s)
00:03:06

[really popular and viewed many thousands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m08s)
00:03:08

[of times so that's some great content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m10s)
00:03:10

[radec has posted lots of cool stuff I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m13s)
00:03:13

[really like this practitioners guide to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m16s)
00:03:16

[apply torch which again this is more for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[more advanced students but it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m21s)
00:03:21

[digging into people who have never used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m23s)
00:03:23

[hi torch before but know a bit about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m25s)
00:03:25

[numerical programming in general and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m28s)
00:03:28

[it's a quick introduction to how high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m30s)
00:03:30

[torch is different and then there's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m32s)
00:03:32

[some interesting little bits of research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m35s)
00:03:35

[like what's the relationship between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m36s)
00:03:36

[learning rate and batch sites so one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m38s)
00:03:38

[the students actually asked me this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m40s)
00:03:40

[before class and I said oh well one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m42s)
00:03:42

[the other students has written an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m44s)
00:03:44

[analysis of exactly that so what he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m46s)
00:03:46

[done is basically looked through and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m49s)
00:03:49

[tried different batch sizes and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m51s)
00:03:51

[different learning rates and tried to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m52s)
00:03:52

[see how they seemed to relate together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m54s)
00:03:54

[and these are all like cool experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m55s)
00:03:55

[which you know you can try yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h03m58s)
00:03:58

[I predict again he's written something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m00s)
00:04:00

[again a kind of a research into this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m04s)
00:04:04

[question I made a claim that the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m05s)
00:04:05

[stochastic gradient descent with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m10s)
00:04:10

[restarts finds more generalizable parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m12s)
00:04:12

[of the function surface because they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m14s)
00:04:14

[kind of flatter and he's been trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m16s)
00:04:16

[figure out is there a way to measure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m18s)
00:04:18

[that more directly not quite successful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m19s)
00:04:19

[yet but a really interesting piece of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m22s)
00:04:22

[research got some introductions to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m23s)
00:04:23

[convolutional neural networks and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[something that we'll be learning about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m32s)
00:04:32

[towards the end of this course but I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m34s)
00:04:34

[sure you've noticed we're using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m36s)
00:04:36

[something called ResNet and a nonce aha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m37s)
00:04:37

[actually posted a pretty impressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m40s)
00:04:40

[analysis of like watts arrest net and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m43s)
00:04:43

[why is it interesting and this one's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m45s)
00:04:45

[actually being very already shared very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m47s)
00:04:47

[widely around the internet I've seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m49s)
00:04:49

[also so some more advanced students who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m50s)
00:04:50

[are interested in jumping ahead can look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m54s)
00:04:54

[at that and uphill Tamang also has done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h04m57s)
00:04:57

[something similar so lots of yeah lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m00s)
00:05:00

[of stuff going on on the forums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m04s)
00:05:04

[I'm sure you've also noticed we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m06s)
00:05:06

[beginner forum now specifically for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m07s)

[know asking questions which you know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m11s)
00:05:11

[is always the case that there are no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m15s)
00:05:15

[dumb questions but when there's lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m17s)
00:05:17

[people around you talking about advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m19s)

[topics it might not feel that way so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m21s)
00:05:21

[hopefully the beginners forum is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m23s)
00:05:23

[less intimidating space and if there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m25s)
00:05:25

[more advanced student who can help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m29s)

00:05:56

[anything to the internet before right I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h05m58s)
00:05:58

[mean you don't have to be a particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m00s)
00:06:00

[kind of person to be allowed to block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m02s)
00:06:02

[something you can just jot down your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m04s)
00:06:04

[notes throw it up there and one handy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m07s)
00:06:07

[thing is if you just put it on the forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m11s)
00:06:11

[and you're not quite sure of some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m12s)
00:06:12

[details then then you know you have an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m15s)
00:06:15

[opportunity to get feedback and say like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m18s)
00:06:18

[oh well that's not quite how that works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m20s)
00:06:20

[you know actually it works this way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m22s)
00:06:22

[instead or oh that's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m23s)
00:06:23

[interesting insight have you thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m25s)
00:06:25

[about taking this further and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m26s)
00:06:26

[so what we've done so far is a kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m29s)
00:06:29

[an injury an introduction as a just as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m32s)
00:06:32

[practitioner to convolutional neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m34s)
00:06:34

[networks for images and we haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m38s)
00:06:38

[really talked much at all about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m41s)
00:06:41

[the theory or why they work or the math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m43s)
00:06:43

[of them but on the other hand what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m46s)
00:06:46

[have done is seen how to build a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m48s)
00:06:48

[which actually works exceptionally well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m52s)
00:06:52

[compact world-class level models and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m55s)
00:06:55

[we'll kind of review a little bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h06m59s)
00:06:59

[that today and then also today we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m01s)
00:07:01

[going to dig in a little quite a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m06s)
00:07:06

[more actually into the underlying theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m08s)
00:07:08

[of like what is a what is a CNN what's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m09s)
00:07:09

[convolution how does this work and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m12s)
00:07:12

[we're going to kind of go through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m14s)
00:07:14

[this cycle where we're going to dig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m16s)
00:07:16

[we're going to do a little intro into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m18s)
00:07:18

[whole bunch of application areas using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m21s)
00:07:21

[neural nets for structured data so kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m23s)
00:07:23

[of like logistics or forecasting or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m25s)
00:07:25

[know financial data or that kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m29s)
00:07:29

[thing and then looking at language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m31s)
00:07:31

[applications and LP applications using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m34s)
00:07:34

[recurrent neural Nets and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m36s)
00:07:36

[collaborative filtering for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m39s)
00:07:39

[recommendations and systems and so these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m42s)
00:07:42

[will all be like similar to what we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m45s)
00:07:45

[done for cnn's for images would be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m47s)
00:07:47

[here's how you can get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[state-of-the-art result without digging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m51s)
00:07:51

[into the theory but but knowing how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m53s)
00:07:53

[actually make a work and then we're kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m55s)
00:07:55

[of going to go back through those almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h07m57s)
00:07:57

[in reverse order so then we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m00s)
00:08:00

[dig right into collaborative filtering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m01s)
00:08:01

[in a lot of detail and see how how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m03s)
00:08:03

[write the code underneath and how the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m06s)
00:08:06

[math works underneath and then we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m08s)
00:08:08

[going to do the same thing for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m10s)
00:08:10

[structured data analysis we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m11s)
00:08:11

[do the same thing for comp nets for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[images and finally an in depth deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m15s)
00:08:15

[into apparent neural networks so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m18s)
00:08:18

[kind of where we're okay so let's start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[by doing a little bit of a review and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m24s)
00:08:24

[want to also provide a bit more detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[on some on some steps that we only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m32s)
00:08:32

[briefly slipped over so I want to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m35s)
00:08:35

[sure that we're all able to complete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m36s)
00:08:36

[kind of last week's assignment which was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m39s)
00:08:39

[that the dog breeze I mean to basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m42s)
00:08:42

[apply what you've learned with another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m45s)
00:08:45

[data set and I thought the easiest one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m47s)
00:08:47

[to do with me the dog breeds cattle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m48s)
00:08:48

[competition and so I want to make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[everybody has everything you need to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m52s)
00:08:52

[this right now so and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m53s)
00:08:53

[first thing is to make sure that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m55s)
00:08:55

[know how to download data and so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h08m57s)
00:08:57

[there's two main places at the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m01s)
00:09:01

[we're kind of downloading data from one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m03s)
00:09:03

[is from cattle and the other is from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m04s)
00:09:04

[like anywhere else and so I'll first of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m07s)
00:09:07

[all do the the casual version so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[download from cattle we use something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m15s)
00:09:15

[called cattle CLI which is gear and to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m18s)
00:09:18

[install what I think it's already in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m24s)
00:09:24

[system will shake yeah so it should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m28s)
00:09:28

[already be in your environment but to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m34s)
00:09:34

[make sure one thing that happens is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m39s)
00:09:39

[because this is downloading from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m41s)
00:09:41

[cattle website through experience rating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m42s)
00:09:42

[every time cap will change us the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m44s)
00:09:44

[website it breaks so anytime you try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[use it and if the cattles websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m48s)
00:09:48

[changed recent when you'll need to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m51s)
00:09:51

[sure you get the most recent version so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m53s)
00:09:53

[you can always go to pip install cable -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h09m55s)
00:09:55

[CL I - - upgrade and so that'll just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[make sure that you've got the latest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m06s)
00:10:06

[version of of it and everything that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m07s)
00:10:07

[depends on okay and so then having done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m10s)
00:10:10

[that you can follow the instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m14s)
00:10:14

[actually I think Reshma was kind enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m16s)
00:10:16

[to they go there's a cable CLI you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m18s)
00:10:18

[like everything you need to know can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m21s)
00:10:21

[under Reshma's github so basically to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m22s)
00:10:22

[that at the next step you go kg download](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m29s)
00:10:29

[and then you provide your username with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m35s)
00:10:35

[- you you provide your password with - P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m37s)
00:10:37

[and then - see it the competition name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m41s)
00:10:41

[and a lot of people in the forum is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m44s)
00:10:44

[being confused about what to enter here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m46s)
00:10:46

[and so the key thing to note is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m47s)
00:10:47

[when you're at a capital competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m49s)
00:10:49

[after the /c there's a specific name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m51s)
00:10:51

[planet - understanding - etcetera right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m55s)
00:10:55

[that's the name you need okay the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h10m58s)
00:10:58

[thing you'll need to make sure is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m02s)
00:11:02

[you've on your own computer have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m03s)
00:11:03

[attempted to click download at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m06s)
00:11:06

[once because when you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m08s)
00:11:08

[ask you to accept the rules if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m09s)
00:11:09

[forgotten to do that kg download will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m12s)
00:11:12

[give you a hint it'll say oh it looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m15s)
00:11:15

[like you might have forgotten the rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m17s)
00:11:17

[if you log into cattle with like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m18s)
00:11:18

[Google account like anything other than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m21s)
00:11:21

[a username password this won't work so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m24s)
00:11:24

[you'll need to click forgot password on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m26s)
00:11:26

[Kaggle and get them to send you a normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m28s)
00:11:28

[password so that's the cattle version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m30s)
00:11:30

[right and so when you do that you end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m33s)
00:11:33

[with a whole folder created for you with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m36s)
00:11:36

[all of that competition and data in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m38s)
00:11:38

[so a couple of reasons you might want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m41s)
00:11:41

[not use that the first years that you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m44s)
00:11:44

[using a data set that's not on cattle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m46s)
00:11:46

[the second is that you don't want all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m48s)
00:11:48

[the data sets in a cattle competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m50s)
00:11:50

[for example the planet competition that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m52s)
00:11:52

[we've been looking at a little bit we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m55s)
00:11:55

[look at again today has data in two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h11m56s)
00:11:56

[formats TIFF and JPEG the TIFF is 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m00s)
00:12:00

[gigabytes and the JPEG is 600 megabytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m03s)
00:12:03

[so you probably don't want to download](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m06s)
00:12:06

[both so I'll show you a really cool kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m08s)
00:12:08

[which actually somebody on the forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m11s)
00:12:11

[taught me I think was one of the young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[MSN students here at USF there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m14s)
00:12:14

[Chrome extension cord curl W get so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m18s)
00:12:18

[can just search for a curl W get and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m24s)
00:12:24

[then you install it by just clicking on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m27s)
00:12:27

[installed and having an extension before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m29s)
00:12:29

[and then from now on every time you try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m31s)
00:12:31

[to download something so I'll try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m35s)
00:12:35

[download this file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m36s)
00:12:36

[and I'll just go ahead and cancel it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m40s)
00:12:40

[right and now you see this little yellow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m42s)
00:12:42

[button that's added up here there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m45s)
00:12:45

[whole command here right so I can copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m47s)
00:12:47

[that and paste it into my window and hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m51s)
00:12:51

[go and it's there cuz okay so what that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h12m59s)
00:12:59

[does is like all of your cookies and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m03s)
00:13:03

[headers and everything else needed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m06s)
00:13:06

[download that file is like say so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m08s)
00:13:08

[is not just useful for downloading data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m10s)
00:13:10

[it's also useful if you like trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m13s)
00:13:13

[download some I don't know TV show or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m16s)
00:13:16

[something anything where you're it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m18s)
00:13:18

[hidden behind a login or something you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m19s)
00:13:19

[can you can grab it and actually that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m23s)
00:13:23

[very useful for data science because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m25s)
00:13:25

[quite often we want to analyze things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[like videos on our on our consoles so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m28s)
00:13:28

[this is a good trick alright so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m31s)
00:13:31

[two ways to get the data so then having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m33s)
00:13:33

[got the data you then need to build your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m40s)
00:13:40

[model right so what I tend to do like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m44s)
00:13:44

[you'll notice that I tend to assume that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m47s)
00:13:47

[the data is in a directory called data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m49s)
00:13:49

[that's a subdirectory of wherever your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m51s)
00:13:51

[notebook is right now you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m54s)
00:13:54

[necessarily actually want to put your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h13m57s)
00:13:57

[data there you might want to put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m00s)
00:14:00

[directly in your home directory or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m01s)
00:14:01

[might wanna put it on another drive or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m03s)
00:14:03

[whatever so what I do is if you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m04s)
00:14:04

[inside my courses do one folder you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m07s)
00:14:07

[see that data is actually a symbolic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m11s)
00:14:11

[link to a different drive alright so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m14s)
00:14:14

[can put it anywhere you like and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m17s)
00:14:17

[you can just add a symbolic link or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m19s)
00:14:19

[can just put it there directly it's up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m22s)
00:14:22

[to you if you haven't used symlinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m24s)
00:14:24

[before they're like aliases or shortcuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m26s)
00:14:26

[on the mac or windows very handy and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m28s)
00:14:28

[there's some threads on the forum about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m32s)
00:14:32

[how to use them if you want help with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m33s)
00:14:33

[that that for example is also how we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m35s)
00:14:35

[actually have the fast AI modules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m38s)
00:14:38

[available from the same place as our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m41s)
00:14:41

[notebooks it's just a symlink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m43s)
00:14:43

[to where they come from anytime you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m45s)
00:14:45

[to see like where things actually point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[to in Linux you can just use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m51s)
00:14:51

[- L flag - listing a directory and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m54s)
00:14:54

[that'll show you where the symlinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m57s)
00:14:57

[exist still lost I'll show you which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h14m59s)
00:14:59

[scenes the directories so forth okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m01s)
00:15:01

[one thing which may be a little unclear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[based on what we've done so far is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m12s)
00:15:12

[how little code you actually need to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[this end to it so what I've got here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m17s)
00:15:17

[is in a single window is an entire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m20s)
00:15:20

[end-to-end process to get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[state-of-the-art result put cats versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m25s)
00:15:25

[dogs all right I've only step I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m27s)
00:15:27

[skipped is the bit where we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m30s)
00:15:30

[downloaded it from title and then where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m31s)
00:15:31

[we unzip it all right so these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m33s)
00:15:33

[literally all the steps and so we import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m37s)
00:15:37

[our libraries and actually if you import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[this one Kampf loner that basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[imports everything else so that's that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m47s)
00:15:47

[we need to tell at the path of where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m51s)
00:15:51

[things are the size that we want the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m53s)
00:15:53

[batch size that we want right so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m55s)
00:15:55

[and we're going to learn a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h15m59s)
00:15:59

[about what these do very shortly but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[basically we say how do we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m02s)
00:16:02

[transform our data so we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m04s)
00:16:04

[transform it in a way that's suitable to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m06s)
00:16:06

[this particular kind of model and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m08s)
00:16:08

[assumes that the photos aside on photos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m10s)
00:16:10

[and that we're going to zoom in up to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m13s)
00:16:13

[ten percent each time we say that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m15s)
00:16:15

[want to get some data based on paths and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m18s)
00:16:18

[so remember this is this idea that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m21s)
00:16:21

[there's a path called cats and the path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m23s)
00:16:23

[called dogs and they're inside a path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m24s)
00:16:24

[called train and a path called valid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m26s)
00:16:26

[note that you can always overwrite these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m28s)
00:16:28

[with other things so if your things are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m34s)
00:16:34

[in different folders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m36s)
00:16:36

[you could either rename them or you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m37s)
00:16:37

[see here there's like a train name and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m39s)
00:16:39

[bowel name you can always pick something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m42s)
00:16:42

[else here also notice there's a test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m44s)
00:16:44

[name so if you want to submit some into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m48s)
00:16:48

[cattle you'll need to fill in the name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m51s)
00:16:51

[the name of the folder where the test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m52s)
00:16:52

[sentence and obviously those those won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m54s)
00:16:54

[be labeled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m56s)
00:16:56

[so then we create a model from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h16m59s)
00:16:59

[pre-training model it's from a resonant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m02s)
00:17:02

[50 model using this data and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[call fit and remember by default that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[has all of the layers but the last few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m11s)
00:17:11

[frozen and again we'll learn a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m13s)
00:17:13

[about what that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m15s)
00:17:15

[and so that's that's what that does so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m17s)
00:17:17

[that that took two and a half minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m19s)
00:17:19

[notice here I didn't say pre-compute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m23s)
00:17:23

[equals true again there's been some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m26s)
00:17:26

[confusion on the forums about like what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m27s)
00:17:27

[that means it's only a is only something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m29s)
00:17:29

[that makes it a little faster for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m33s)
00:17:33

[first step right so you can always skip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m35s)
00:17:35

[it and if you're at all confused about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m37s)
00:17:37

[it or it's causing you any problems just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m39s)
00:17:39

[leave it off right because it's just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m41s)
00:17:41

[it's just a shortcut which caches some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m45s)
00:17:45

[of the intermediate steps that don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m48s)
00:17:48

[have to be recalculating each time and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m50s)
00:17:50

[remember that when we are using pre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m52s)
00:17:52

[computed activations data or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m54s)
00:17:54

[augmentation doesn't work right so even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m56s)
00:17:56

[if you ask for a data augmentation if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h17m59s)
00:17:59

[you've got pre compute equals true it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m01s)
00:18:01

[doesn't actually do any data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m04s)
00:18:04

[augmentation because it's using the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m05s)
00:18:05

[cached non augmented activations so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m06s)
00:18:06

[this case to keep this as simple as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m11s)
00:18:11

[possible I have no pre computed anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m12s)
00:18:12

[going on so I do three cycles of length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m14s)
00:18:14

[one and then I can then unfreeze so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m17s)
00:18:17

[now going to train the whole thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m24s)
00:18:24

[something we haven't seen before and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m25s)
00:18:25

[we'll learn about in the second half is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m27s)
00:18:27

[called B and freeze for now all you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m30s)
00:18:30

[to know is that if you're using a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m33s)
00:18:33

[like a bigger deeper model like ResNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m36s)
00:18:36

[50 or rez next 101 on a data set that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m39s)
00:18:39

[very very similar to imagenet like these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m42s)
00:18:42

[cat sandbox data set sort of words it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m46s)
00:18:46

[like sidon photos of standard objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m48s)
00:18:48

[you know of a similar size to image turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m51s)
00:18:51

[and money somewhere between 200 and 500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m54s)
00:18:54

[pixels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m56s)
00:18:56

[you should probably add this line when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h18m57s)
00:18:57

[you unfreeze for those of you that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[more advanced what it's doing is it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[causing the batch normalization moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m06s)
00:19:06

[averages to not be updated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m09s)
00:19:09

[but in the second half of this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m10s)
00:19:10

[we're gonna learn all about why we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m12s)
00:19:12

[that it's something that's not supported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m14s)
00:19:14

[by any other library but it turns out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m15s)
00:19:15

[be super important anyway so we do one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m18s)
00:19:18

[more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m20s)
00:19:20

[epoch with training the whole network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m21s)
00:19:21

[and then at the end we use test time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m26s)
00:19:26

[augmentation to ensure that we get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m28s)
00:19:28

[best predictions we can and that gives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m31s)
00:19:31

[us ninety nine point four five percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[so that's that's it right so when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[try a new data set they're basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m41s)
00:19:41

[minimum set of steps that you would need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m44s)
00:19:44

[to follow you'll notice this is assuming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m47s)
00:19:47

[I already know what learning wrote to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m49s)
00:19:49

[use so you'd use the learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m51s)
00:19:51

[finder for that it's assuming that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m53s)
00:19:53

[know that the directory layout and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m56s)
00:19:56

[forth so that's kind of a minimum set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h19m59s)
00:19:59

[now one of the things that I wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m02s)
00:20:02

[make sure you had an understanding of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[how to do is how to use other libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m07s)
00:20:07

[other than fast AI and so I feel like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m10s)
00:20:10

[the best thing to to look at is to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m12s)
00:20:12

[at care us because care us is a library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m15s)
00:20:15

[just like fast AI sits on top of pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m18s)
00:20:18

[torch care us sits on top of actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[whole variety of different backends it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[fits mainly people nowadays use it with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m25s)
00:20:25

[tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[there's also an MX net version there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[also a Microsoft CNT K version so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m32s)
00:20:32

[I've got if you do a git pull you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m37s)
00:20:37

[that there's a something called care us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m39s)
00:20:39

[less than one where I've attempted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m43s)
00:20:43

[replicate at least parts of lesson one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m46s)
00:20:46

[in care us just to give you a sense of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m48s)
00:20:48

[how that works I'm not going to talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m52s)
00:20:52

[more about batch two norm freeze now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h20m59s)
00:20:59

[other than to say if you're using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m00s)
00:21:00

[something which has got a number larger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[than 34 at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m07s)
00:21:07

[so like ResNet 50 or res next 101 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m09s)
00:21:09

[you're trading a data set that has that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m11s)
00:21:11

[is very similar to image net so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[like normal photos of normal sizes where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m18s)
00:21:18

[the thing of interest takes up most of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m20s)
00:21:20

[the frame then you probably should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m22s)
00:21:22

[at the end fries true after unfreeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m24s)
00:21:24

[if in doubt try trading it with and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m27s)
00:21:27

[try trading it without more advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m30s)
00:21:30

[students will certainly talk about it on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m33s)
00:21:33

[the forums this week and we will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m35s)
00:21:35

[talking about the details of it in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m37s)
00:21:37

[second half of the course when we come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m39s)
00:21:39

[back to our CNN in death section in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m41s)
00:21:41

[second last lesson so with care us again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m46s)
00:21:46

[we import a bunch of stuff and remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h21m55s)
00:21:55

[I mentioned that this idea that you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m01s)
00:22:01

[got a thing called train and a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m03s)
00:22:03

[called valid and inside that you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m04s)
00:22:04

[a thing called dogs and things called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m06s)
00:22:06

[cats is a standard way of providing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m07s)
00:22:07

[image labelled images so Karis does that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m10s)
00:22:10

[too right so it's going to tell it where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m14s)
00:22:14

[the training set and the validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m16s)
00:22:16

[are twice what batch size to used now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m18s)
00:22:18

[you'll notice in Karis we need much much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m24s)
00:22:24

[much more code to do the same thing more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m27s)
00:22:27

[importantly each part of that code has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m32s)
00:22:32

[many many many more things you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m34s)
00:22:34

[set and if you set them wrong everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m36s)
00:22:36

[breaks right so I'll give you a summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m38s)
00:22:38

[of what they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m43s)
00:22:43

[so you're basically rather than creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m44s)
00:22:44

[a single data object in chaos we first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m47s)
00:22:47

[of all have to define something called a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m51s)
00:22:51

[data generator to say kind of generate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m52s)
00:22:52

[the data and so a data generator we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m55s)
00:22:55

[basically have to say what kind of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h22m57s)
00:22:57

[augmentation we want to do and we also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m00s)
00:23:00

[we actually have to say what kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m04s)
00:23:04

[normalization do we want to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m08s)
00:23:08

[so we're else with fast AI we just say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m11s)
00:23:11

[whatever ResNet 50 requires just do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m13s)
00:23:13

[for me please we actually have to kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m16s)
00:23:16

[of know a little bit about what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m18s)
00:23:18

[expected of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m19s)
00:23:19

[generally speaking copying and pasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m21s)
00:23:21

[cos code from the internet is a good way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m23s)
00:23:23

[to make sure you've got the right the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m25s)
00:23:25

[right stuff to make that work and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m27s)
00:23:27

[it doesn't have a kind of a standard set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m30s)
00:23:30

[of like here the best data augmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m32s)
00:23:32

[parameters to use for photos so you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m34s)
00:23:34

[I've copied and pasted all of this from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m37s)
00:23:37

[the Kaos documentation so I don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m39s)
00:23:39

[if it's I don't think it's the best set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m43s)
00:23:43

[to use it all but it's the set that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m45s)
00:23:45

[they're using in their docks so having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m46s)
00:23:46

[said this is how I want to generate data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m49s)
00:23:49

[so horizontally fit sometimes you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m51s)
00:23:51

[zoom sometimes sheer sometimes we then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m53s)
00:23:53

[create a generator from that by taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m56s)
00:23:56

[that data generator and saying I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h23m59s)
00:23:59

[generate images by looking from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m01s)
00:24:01

[directory we pass in the directory which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m04s)
00:24:04

[is of the same directory structure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m07s)
00:24:07

[fast AI users and you'll see there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m09s)
00:24:09

[some overlaps with kind of how fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m12s)
00:24:12

[works here you tell it what size images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m14s)
00:24:14

[you want to create you tell at what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m16s)
00:24:16

[batch size you want in your mini batches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m18s)
00:24:18

[and then there's something you not to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m19s)
00:24:19

[worry about too much but basically if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m22s)
00:24:22

[you're just got two possible outcomes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m24s)
00:24:24

[you would generally say binary here if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m26s)
00:24:26

[you've got multiple possible outcomes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m28s)
00:24:28

[would say categorical yeah so we've only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[got cats or dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m32s)
00:24:32

[so it's binary so an example of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m33s)
00:24:33

[where things get a little more complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m37s)
00:24:37

[is you have to do the same thing for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m39s)
00:24:39

[validation set so it's up to you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m41s)
00:24:41

[create a data generator that doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m43s)
00:24:43

[have data augmentation because obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m45s)
00:24:45

[for the validation set unless you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m47s)
00:24:47

[using t/ta that's going to start things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m49s)
00:24:49

[up you also when you train you randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[reorder the images so that they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m57s)
00:24:57

[always shown in different orders to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h24m59s)
00:24:59

[it more random but with a validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[it's vital that you don't do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m03s)
00:25:03

[because if you shuffle the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m06s)
00:25:06

[set you then can't track how well you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m07s)
00:25:07

[doing it's in a different order for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m09s)
00:25:09

[labels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m11s)
00:25:11

[that's a basically these are the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m11s)
00:25:11

[steps you have to do every time with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m14s)
00:25:14

[care us so again the reason I was using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m17s)
00:25:17

[ResNet 50 before is chaos doesn't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m22s)
00:25:22

[ResNet 34 unfortunately so I just wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m24s)
00:25:24

[to compare like with Mike so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m26s)
00:25:26

[to use resident 50 here there isn't the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m28s)
00:25:28

[same idea with chaos of saying like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m32s)
00:25:32

[constructor model that is suitable for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m34s)
00:25:34

[this data set for me so you have to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m37s)
00:25:37

[it by hand right so the way you do it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[to basically say this is my base model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m42s)
00:25:42

[and then you have to construct on top of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m44s)
00:25:44

[that manually the layers that you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m47s)
00:25:47

[to add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[and so by the end of this course you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[understand a way it is that these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m52s)
00:25:52

[particular three layers other layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m53s)
00:25:53

[that we add so having done that in chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h25m56s)
00:25:56

[you basically say okay this is my model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m01s)
00:26:01

[and then again there isn't like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m03s)
00:26:03

[concept to it like automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m06s)
00:26:06

[freezing things or an API for that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m08s)
00:26:08

[you just have to allow look through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m10s)
00:26:10

[layers that you want to freeze and call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m13s)
00:26:13

[dot trainable equals false on them in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m16s)
00:26:16

[Karis there's a concept we don't have in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m20s)
00:26:20

[fast AI or play a torch of compiling a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m22s)
00:26:22

[model so basically once your model is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m25s)
00:26:25

[ready to use you have to compile it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m27s)
00:26:27

[passing in what kind of optimizer to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m28s)
00:26:28

[what kind of loss to look for about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m32s)
00:26:32

[metric so again with fast AI you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m33s)
00:26:33

[have to pass this in because we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m37s)
00:26:37

[what loss is the write loss to use you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m38s)
00:26:38

[can always override it but for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m41s)
00:26:41

[particular model we give you good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m43s)
00:26:43

[defaults okay so having done all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m44s)
00:26:44

[rather than calling fit you call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m48s)
00:26:48

[generator passing in those two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m50s)
00:26:50

[generators that you saw earlier the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m53s)
00:26:53

[Train generator in the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m54s)
00:26:54

[generator for reasons I don't quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m55s)
00:26:55

[understand chaos expects you to also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h26m59s)
00:26:59

[tell it how many batches there are per](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m01s)
00:27:01

[epoch so the number of batches is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m03s)
00:27:03

[quarter the size of the generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m06s)
00:27:06

[divided by the batch size you can tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m08s)
00:27:08

[it how many epochs just like in fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m11s)
00:27:11

[you can say how many processes or how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[many workers to use for pre-processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m18s)
00:27:18

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m21s)
00:27:21

[unlike fast AI the default in chaos is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m23s)
00:27:23

[basically not to use any so to get good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m26s)
00:27:26

[speed you're going to make sure you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m30s)
00:27:30

[include this and so that's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m32s)
00:27:32

[enough to start fine tuning the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[layers so as you can see I got to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m39s)
00:27:39

[validation accuracy of 95% but as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m44s)
00:27:44

[can also see something really weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m47s)
00:27:47

[happened we're after one it was like 49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m48s)
00:27:48

[and then it was 69 and then 95 I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m50s)
00:27:50

[know why these are so low that's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m53s)
00:27:53

[normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m56s)
00:27:56

[I may have there may be a bug and chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h27m58s)
00:27:58

[they may be a bug in my code I reached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m00s)
00:28:00

[out on Twitter to see if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m03s)
00:28:03

[anybody could figure it out but they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[couldn't I guess this is one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m05s)
00:28:05

[challenges with using something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m07s)
00:28:07

[this is one of the reasons I wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m09s)
00:28:09

[use fast AI for this course is it's much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[harder to screw things up so I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[know if I screwed something up or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m16s)
00:28:16

[somebody else did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[yes you know this is you've seen the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m18s)
00:28:18

[chance to float back end yeah yeah and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m23s)
00:28:23

[if you want to run this to try it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m25s)
00:28:25

[yourself you just can just go pip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[install tensorflow - GPU Kerris okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m31s)
00:28:31

[because it's not part of the faster I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m39s)
00:28:39

[environment by default but that should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m40s)
00:28:40

[be all you need to do to get that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m45s)
00:28:45

[working so then there isn't a concept of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m47s)
00:28:47

[like layer groups or differential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m55s)
00:28:55

[learning rates or partial unfreezing or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h28m58s)
00:28:58

[whatever so you have to decide like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m00s)
00:29:00

[had to print out all of the layers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m02s)
00:29:02

[decide manually how many I wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m03s)
00:29:03

[fine-tune so I decided to fine-tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m06s)
00:29:06

[everything from a layer 140 onwards so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[that's why I just looked through like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m10s)
00:29:10

[this after you change that you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m11s)
00:29:11

[recompile the model and then after that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m14s)
00:29:14

[I then ran another step and again I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m17s)
00:29:17

[don't know what happened here the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m19s)
00:29:19

[accuracy of the training set stayed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m20s)
00:29:20

[about the same but the validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m22s)
00:29:22

[totally fill in the hole and I mean the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m24s)
00:29:24

[main thing to notice even if we put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m27s)
00:29:27

[aside the validation set we're getting I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m29s)
00:29:29

[mean I guess the main thing is there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m33s)
00:29:33

[hell of a lot more code here which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m35s)
00:29:35

[kind of annoying but also the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m36s)
00:29:36

[performance is very different so where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m39s)
00:29:39

[else is here even on the training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m40s)
00:29:40

[we're getting like 97% after four epochs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[that took a total of about eight minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m46s)
00:29:46

[you know over here we had 99.5% on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m48s)
00:29:48

[validation set and it ran a lot faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m53s)
00:29:53

[so I was like four or five minutes right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h29m57s)
00:29:57

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m02s)
00:30:02

[depending on what you do particularly if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m06s)
00:30:06

[you end up wanting to deploy stuff to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m09s)
00:30:09

[mobile devices at the moment the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[PI torch on mobile situation is very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[early so you may find yourself wanting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[to use tensorflow or you may work for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m19s)
00:30:19

[company that's kind of settled on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m21s)
00:30:21

[tensorflow so if you need to convert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[something like redo something you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m27s)
00:30:27

[learnt here intensive flow you probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m29s)
00:30:29

[want to do it with care us but just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m31s)
00:30:31

[recognize you know it's got to take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m34s)
00:30:34

[bit more work to get there and by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m37s)
00:30:37

[default it's much harder to get I mean I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m40s)
00:30:40

[to get the same state of the out results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

00:32:00

[of most of the stuff you would need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m08s)

[but on the dog of reinstated said just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m17s)
00:32:17

[to remind you that kind of last few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m19s)
00:32:19

[minutes of last week's lesson I show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m23s)
00:32:23

[how to do much of that including like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m26s)
00:32:26

[how I actually explored the data to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m30s)
00:32:30

[out like what the classes were and how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[big the images were and stuff like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m35s)
00:32:35

[right so if you've forgotten that or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m38s)
00:32:38

[didn't quite follow at all last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m39s)
00:32:39

[check out the video from last week to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m42s)
00:32:42

[see one thing that we didn't talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m44s)
00:32:44

[is how do you actually submit to Carol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m47s)
00:32:47

[so how do you actually get predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m49s)
00:32:49

[so I just wanted to show you that last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m51s)
00:32:51

[piece as well and on the wiki thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m53s)
00:32:53

[this week I've already put a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m56s)
00:32:56

[image of this to show you these days but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h32m58s)
00:32:58

[if you go to the kaggle website for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m01s)
00:33:01

[every competition there's a section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m04s)
00:33:04

[called evaluation and they tell you what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m06s)
00:33:06

[it's a bit and so I just copied and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m08s)
00:33:08

[pasted these two lines from from there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m10s)
00:33:10

[and so it says we're expected to submit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[a file where the first line contains the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m15s)
00:33:15

[the work the word ID and then a comma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m18s)
00:33:18

[separated list of all of the possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m22s)
00:33:22

[dog breeds and then every line after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m23s)
00:33:23

[that will contain the idea itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m26s)
00:33:26

[followed by all the probabilities of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m29s)
00:33:29

[the different dog breeds so how do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m31s)
00:33:31

[create that so recognize that inside our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m35s)
00:33:35

[data object there's a dot classes which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[has got in alphabetical order all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m42s)
00:33:42

[four other classes and then so it's got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m46s)
00:33:46

[all of the different classes and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m52s)
00:33:52

[inside data dot test data set just yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m53s)
00:33:53

[you can also see there's all the file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h33m58s)
00:33:58

[names so and just to remind you dogs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m00s)
00:34:00

[cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m05s)
00:34:05

[sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m05s)
00:34:05

[cats dog breeds was not provided in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m06s)
00:34:06

[kind of care our style format where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m11s)
00:34:11

[dogs and cats from different folders but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[instead it was provided as a CSV file of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m15s)
00:34:15

[labels right so when you get a CSV file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m18s)
00:34:18

[of labels you use image classifier data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m21s)
00:34:21

[from CSV rather than image classifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m25s)
00:34:25

[data from parts there isn't an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m27s)
00:34:27

[equivalent in care us so you'll see like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m31s)
00:34:31

[on the cattle forums people share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m33s)
00:34:33

[scripts for how to convert it to a care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m36s)
00:34:36

[our style folders but in our case we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m38s)
00:34:38

[don't have to we just go image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m40s)
00:34:40

[classifier data from CSV passing in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m41s)
00:34:41

[CSV file and so the CSV file will you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m44s)
00:34:44

[know has automatically told the data you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m49s)
00:34:49

[know what the masses are and then also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m51s)
00:34:51

[we can see from the folder of test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m54s)
00:34:54

[images what the file names of those are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h34m57s)
00:34:57

[so with those two pieces of information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m00s)
00:35:00

[we're ready to go so I always think it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m03s)
00:35:03

[a good idea to use TTA as you saw with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m07s)
00:35:07

[that dogs and cats example just now it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m09s)
00:35:09

[can really improve things particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m11s)
00:35:11

[when your model is less good so I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m13s)
00:35:13

[say learn dot t ta and if you pass in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m17s)
00:35:17

[yeah if you pass in is test equals true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m25s)
00:35:25

[then it's going to give you predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m29s)
00:35:29

[on the test set rather than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m32s)
00:35:32

[validation set okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m33s)
00:35:33

[and now obviously we can't now get an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m35s)
00:35:35

[accuracy or anything because by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m39s)
00:35:39

[definition we don't know the labels for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m40s)
00:35:40

[the test set right so by default most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m42s)
00:35:42

[high-touch models give you back the log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m48s)
00:35:48

[of the predictions so then we just have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m51s)
00:35:51

[to go X of that to get back out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m54s)
00:35:54

[probabilities so in this case the test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m57s)
00:35:57

[set had ten thousand three hundred and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[fifty seven images in it and there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m01s)
00:36:01

[120 possible breeds all right so we get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m03s)
00:36:03

[back a matrix of of that size and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m06s)
00:36:06

[now need to turn that into something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m10s)
00:36:10

[that looks like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m12s)
00:36:12

[and so the easiest way to do that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m16s)
00:36:16

[with pandas if you're not familiar with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m17s)
00:36:17

[pandas there's lots of information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m19s)
00:36:19

[online about it or check out the machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m21s)
00:36:21

[learning course intro to machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m23s)
00:36:23

[learning that we have where we do lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m24s)
00:36:24

[of stuff with pandas but basically we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m26s)
00:36:26

[can describe PD data frame and pass in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m28s)
00:36:28

[that matrix and then we can say the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m30s)
00:36:30

[names of the columns are equal to data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m33s)
00:36:33

[duck classes and then finally we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m36s)
00:36:36

[insert a new column at position 0 called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m38s)
00:36:38

[ID that contains the file names but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m41s)
00:36:41

[you'll notice that the file names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m45s)
00:36:45

[contain five letters at the end I start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m47s)
00:36:47

[we don't want and four letters at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m51s)
00:36:51

[end we don't want so I just subset in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m52s)
00:36:52

[like so right so at that point I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h36m56s)
00:36:56

[a data frame that looks like this which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m02s)
00:37:02

[is what we want so you can now call a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m06s)
00:37:06

[data frame data so social cues dated DF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m10s)
00:37:10

[not des let's fix it now data frame okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m13s)
00:37:13

[so you can now call data frame to CSV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m24s)
00:37:24

[and quite often you'll find these files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[actually get quite big so it's a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m30s)
00:37:30

[idea to say compression equals gzip and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m33s)
00:37:33

[that'll zip it up on the server for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m35s)
00:37:35

[and that's going to create a zipped up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m37s)
00:37:37

[CSV file on the server on wherever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m41s)
00:37:41

[you're running is Jupiter notebook so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m44s)
00:37:44

[you need apps that you now need to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m46s)
00:37:46

[that back to your computer so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m47s)
00:37:47

[upload it or you can use carol CLA so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m49s)
00:37:49

[you can type kgs submit and do it that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m55s)
00:37:55

[I generally download it to my computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m55s)
00:37:55

[so like how often back to this lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h37m58s)
00:37:58

[double check it all looks ok so to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m00s)
00:38:00

[that there's a cool little theme called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m04s)
00:38:04

[file link and if you run file link with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m05s)
00:38:05

[a path on your server it gives you back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m09s)
00:38:09

[a URL which you can click on and it will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m11s)
00:38:11

[download that file from the server onto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m14s)
00:38:14

[your computer so if I click on that now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m18s)
00:38:18

[I can go ahead and save it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m21s)
00:38:21

[and then I can see in my downloads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m25s)
00:38:25

[there it is here's my submission file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m33s)
00:38:33

[they want to open their yeah and as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m40s)
00:38:40

[can see it's exactly what I asked for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m44s)
00:38:44

[there's my ID and 120 different dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m45s)
00:38:45

[breeds and then here's my first row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m49s)
00:38:49

[containing the file name and the 120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m51s)
00:38:51

[different probabilities okay so then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m54s)
00:38:54

[can go ahead and submit that to cattle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m56s)
00:38:56

[through their through their regular form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h38m58s)
00:38:58

[and so this is also a good way you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m00s)
00:39:00

[see we've now got a good way of both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m03s)
00:39:03

[grabbing any file off the internet and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m05s)
00:39:05

[getting a to our AWS instance or paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m08s)
00:39:08

[space or whatever by using the cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m10s)
00:39:10

[little extension in chrome and we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m15s)
00:39:15

[also got a way of grabbing stuff off our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m17s)
00:39:17

[server easily those of you that are more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m18s)
00:39:18

[command line oriented you can also use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m22s)
00:39:22

[SCP of course but I kind of like doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m24s)
00:39:24

[everything through the notebook all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m28s)
00:39:28

[right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m31s)
00:39:31

[one other question I had during the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m32s)
00:39:32

[was like what if I want to just get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m34s)
00:39:34

[single a single file that I want to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m37s)
00:39:37

[know get a prediction for so for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m42s)
00:39:42

[you know maybe I want to get this first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m45s)
00:39:45

[file from my validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m47s)
00:39:47

[so there's its name so you can always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m49s)
00:39:49

[look at a file just by calling image dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m52s)
00:39:52

[open that just uses regular - imaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m54s)
00:39:54

[library and so what you can do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h39m59s)
00:39:59

[there's actually I'll show you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m04s)
00:40:04

[shortest version you can just call learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m05s)
00:40:05

[predict array passing in your your image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m09s)
00:40:09

[okay now the image needs to have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m16s)
00:40:16

[transformed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m20s)
00:40:20

[so you've seen transform Trent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m21s)
00:40:21

[transforms from model before normally we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m24s)
00:40:24

[just put put it all in one variable but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m27s)
00:40:27

[actually behind the scenes it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[returning to things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m31s)
00:40:31

[it was returning training transforms and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m32s)
00:40:32

[validation transforms so I can actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m34s)
00:40:34

[split them apart and so here you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[I'm actually applying example my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m38s)
00:40:38

[training transforms or probably more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m41s)
00:40:41

[likely that would apply validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m43s)
00:40:43

[transforms that gives me back an array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m45s)
00:40:45

[containing the image the transformed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m48s)
00:40:48

[image which I can then past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m51s)
00:40:51

[everything that gets passed to or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m55s)
00:40:55

[returned from bottles is generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h40m58s)
00:40:58

[assumed to be a mini batch right it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m01s)
00:41:01

[generally assumed to be a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m03s)
00:41:03

[images so we'll talk more about some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m05s)
00:41:05

[numpy tricks later but basically in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m07s)
00:41:07

[case we only have one image so we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m10s)
00:41:10

[to turn that into a mini batch of images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m13s)
00:41:13

[so in other words we need to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m15s)
00:41:15

[tensor that basically is not just rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m16s)
00:41:16

[by columns by channels but it's number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m21s)
00:41:21

[of image by rows by columns by channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m24s)
00:41:24

[and as one image so it's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m26s)
00:41:26

[becomes a 4 dimensional tensor so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m29s)
00:41:29

[there's a cool little trick in numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m31s)
00:41:31

[that if you index into an array with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m33s)
00:41:33

[none that basically adds additional unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m36s)
00:41:36

[access to the start so it turns it from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m39s)
00:41:39

[an image into a mini batch of one images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m41s)
00:41:41

[and so that's why we had to do that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[if you basically find you're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m46s)
00:41:46

[do things with a single image with any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m48s)
00:41:48

[kind of Pi torch or fast AI thing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[is just something you might you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m55s)
00:41:55

[find it says like expecting four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m56s)
00:41:56

[dimensions only got three it probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h41m59s)
00:41:59

[means that or if you get back a return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m02s)
00:42:02

[value from something that has like some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m04s)
00:42:04

[weird first access that's probably why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m07s)
00:42:07

[it's probably giving you like back a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m10s)
00:42:10

[mini batch okay and so we'll learn a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m11s)
00:42:11

[more about this but it's just something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m13s)
00:42:13

[to be aware of okay so that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m15s)
00:42:15

[everything you need to do in practice so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m22s)
00:42:22

[now we're going to kind of get into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m28s)
00:42:28

[little bit of theory what's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[going on behind the scenes with these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m32s)
00:42:32

[convolutional neural networks and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m34s)
00:42:34

[might remember it back in Lesson one we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[actually saw our first little bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m43s)
00:42:43

[theory which we stole from this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m48s)

[either explained visually and we learnt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m53s)
00:42:53

[that a that a convolution is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m56s)
00:42:56

[where we basically have a little matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h42m58s)
00:42:58

[in deep learning nearly always three by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m01s)

[three a little matrix that we basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m03s)
00:43:03

[multiply every element of that matrix by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m06s)
00:43:06

[every element of a three by three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m09s)

00:43:10

[was a views company that built that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h43m58s)
00:43:58

[so Tokyo was kind enough to share this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m01s)
00:44:01

[fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m03s)
00:44:03

[he created he's at Google now and I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[to kind of step you through works I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m09s)
00:44:09

[think it explains really really well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[what's going on and then after we look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m12s)
00:44:12

[at the video we're going to see how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m14s)
00:44:14

[implement the whole a whole sequence of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m15s)
00:44:15

[kintyre set of layers of convolution on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m18s)
00:44:18

[your network in Microsoft Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m20s)
00:44:20

[so with you're a visual learner or a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m23s)
00:44:23

[spreadsheet learner hopefully you'll be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m26s)
00:44:26

[able to understand all this okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m27s)
00:44:27

[we're going to start with an image and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m29s)
00:44:29

[something that we're going to do later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m32s)
00:44:32

[in the course is we're going to learn to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m33s)
00:44:33

[nice digits so we'll do it like end to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m35s)
00:44:35

[end we'll do the whole thing so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m36s)
00:44:36

[pretty similar so we're going to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m39s)
00:44:39

[recognize in this case letters so here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m41s)
00:44:41

[an A which obviously it's actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m44s)
00:44:44

[grid of numbers right and so there's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m46s)
00:44:46

[creative numbers and so what we do is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m50s)
00:44:50

[take our first convolutional filter so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m51s)
00:44:51

[we're assuming this is all this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[assuming that these are already learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[right and you can see this point it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h44m58s)
00:44:58

[got wiped down the right-hand side right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m01s)
00:45:01

[and black down the left so it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m03s)
00:45:03

[zero zero zero maybe negative 1 negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m05s)
00:45:05

[1 negative 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 and so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m07s)
00:45:07

[taking each 3x3 part of the image and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m10s)
00:45:10

[multiplying it by that 3x3 matrix not as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m13s)
00:45:13

[a matrix product that an element-wise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m16s)
00:45:16

[product and so you can see what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m18s)
00:45:18

[is everywhere where the the white edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m21s)
00:45:21

[is matching the edge of the a and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m24s)
00:45:24

[black edge isn't we're getting green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m28s)
00:45:28

[we're getting a positive and everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m30s)
00:45:30

[where it's the opposite we're getting a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m32s)
00:45:32

[negative we're getting a red right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m33s)
00:45:33

[so that's the first filter creating the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m35s)
00:45:35

[first that the result of the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m39s)
00:45:39

[kernel right and so here's a new kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m41s)
00:45:41

[this one is it's got a white stripe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m44s)
00:45:44

[along the top right so we literally scan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m46s)
00:45:46

[through every 3x3 part of the matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m49s)
00:45:49

[multiplying those 3 bits of the a the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m52s)
00:45:52

[neighbors of the a by the 9 bits as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m55s)
00:45:55

[filter to find out whether it's red or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m57s)
00:45:57

[green and how red or green it is ok and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h45m59s)
00:45:59

[so this is assuming we had two filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m02s)
00:46:02

[one was a bottom edge one was a left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m04s)
00:46:04

[edge and you can see here the top edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m07s)
00:46:07

[not surprisingly it's red here so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m08s)
00:46:08

[bottom edge was red here and green here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m10s)
00:46:10

[the right edge right here in green here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m12s)
00:46:12

[and then in the next step we add a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m15s)
00:46:15

[non-linearity ok the rectified linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[unit which literally means strongly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m20s)
00:46:20

[negatives so here the Reds all gone okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m23s)
00:46:23

[so here's layer 1 the input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m26s)
00:46:26

[here's layup to the result of 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m28s)
00:46:28

[convolutional filters here's layer 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[which is which is throw away all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m33s)
00:46:33

[red stuff and that's called a rectified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m36s)
00:46:36

[linear unit and then layer 4 is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m38s)
00:46:38

[something called a max pull on a layer 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m41s)
00:46:41

[we replace every 2 by 2 part of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m43s)
00:46:43

[grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m48s)
00:46:48

[and we replace it with its maximum mat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m48s)
00:46:48

[so it basically makes it half the size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m51s)
00:46:51

[it's basically the same thing but half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m53s)
00:46:53

[the size and then we can go through and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m55s)
00:46:55

[do exactly the same thing we can have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m57s)
00:46:57

[some new filter three by three filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h46m59s)
00:46:59

[that we put through each of the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m02s)
00:47:02

[results of the previous layer okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m04s)
00:47:04

[again we can throw away the red bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m08s)
00:47:08

[right so get rid of all the negatives so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m10s)
00:47:10

[we just keep the positives that's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m13s)
00:47:13

[applying a rectified linear unit and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m14s)
00:47:14

[that gets us to our next layer of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m18s)
00:47:18

[convolutional neural network so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m21s)
00:47:21

[see that by you know at this layer back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[here it was kind of very interpretive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m26s)
00:47:26

[all it's like we've either got bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m29s)
00:47:29

[edges or left edges but then the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m30s)
00:47:30

[layer was combining the results of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m33s)
00:47:33

[convolutions so it's starting to become](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m36s)
00:47:36

[a lot less clear like intuitively what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m37s)
00:47:37

[happening but it's doing the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m40s)
00:47:40

[and then we do another max pull right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m42s)
00:47:42

[we replace every 2x2 or 3x3 section with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m45s)
00:47:45

[a single digit so here this 2x2 it's all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m48s)
00:47:48

[black so we replaced it with a black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m52s)
00:47:52

[right and then we go and we take that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m53s)
00:47:53

[and we we compare it to basically a kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h47m56s)
00:47:56

[of a template of what we would expect to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m00s)
00:48:00

[see if it was an a it was a B but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m03s)
00:48:03

[see it was d give it an E and we see how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[closely it matches and we can do it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m07s)
00:48:07

[exactly the same way we can multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m10s)
00:48:10

[every one of the values in this four by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m12s)
00:48:12

[eight matrix with every one of the four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m15s)
00:48:15

[by eight in this one and this one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m18s)
00:48:18

[this one and we add we just add them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m20s)
00:48:20

[together to say like how often does it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m22s)
00:48:22

[match versus how often does it not match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m24s)
00:48:24

[and then that could be converted to give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m26s)
00:48:26

[us a percentage probability that this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m29s)
00:48:29

[a no so in this case this particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m33s)
00:48:33

[template matched well with a so notice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m35s)
00:48:35

[we're not doing an each training here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m39s)
00:48:39

[right this is how it would work if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m41s)
00:48:41

[have a pre trained model all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m43s)
00:48:43

[when we download a pre trained imagenet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m46s)
00:48:46

[model off the internet and isn't on an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m48s)
00:48:48

[image without any changing to it this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m50s)
00:48:50

[what's happening or if we take a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m52s)
00:48:52

[that you've trained and you're applying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m54s)
00:48:54

[it to some test set or for some new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m56s)
00:48:56

[image this is what it's doing all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h48m58s)
00:48:58

[as it's basically taking it through it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m00s)
00:49:00

[buying a convolution to each layer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m02s)
00:49:02

[each multiple convolutional filters to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m04s)
00:49:04

[each layer and then doing the rectified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m08s)
00:49:08

[linear unit so throw away the negatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m12s)
00:49:12

[and then do the max pull and then repeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m14s)
00:49:14

[that a bunch of times and so then we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m18s)
00:49:18

[do it with a new letter A or letter B or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m21s)
00:49:21

[whatever and keep going through that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m24s)
00:49:24

[process right so as you can see that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m28s)
00:49:28

[far nice the visualization thing and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m31s)
00:49:31

[could have created because I'm not at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m33s)
00:49:33

[vo so thanks to him for sharing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m35s)
00:49:35

[he actually this is not done by hand he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m40s)
00:49:40

[actually wrote a piece of computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m42s)
00:49:42

[software to actually do these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m43s)
00:49:43

[convolutions this is actually being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m45s)
00:49:45

[actually being done dynamically which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m47s)
00:49:47

[pretty cool so I'm more of a spreadsheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m49s)
00:49:49

[guy personally I'm a simple person so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m52s)
00:49:52

[here is the same thing now in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m56s)
00:49:56

[spreadsheet all right and so you'll find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h49m58s)
00:49:58

[this in the github repo so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m00s)
00:50:00

[either get clone the repo to your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[computer open up the spreadsheet or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m06s)
00:50:06

[can just go to github.com slash / ji and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m08s)
00:50:08

[click on this it's it's inside if you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m11s)
00:50:11

[to our repo and just go to courses as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[usual go to deal 1 as usual you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[there's an Excel section there okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m26s)
00:50:26

[so he lay all that so you can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m29s)
00:50:29

[download them by clicking them or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[can clone the whole repo and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[looking at cognitive example convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m33s)
00:50:33

[example all right so you can see I have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m36s)
00:50:36

[here an input right so in this case the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m40s)
00:50:40

[input is the number 7 so I grab this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m44s)
00:50:44

[from a dataset called m-must MN ist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[which we'll be looking at in a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m51s)
00:50:51

[detail and I just took one of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[digits at random and I put it into Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m55s)
00:50:55

[and so you can see every Hextall is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h50m58s)
00:50:58

[actually just a number between 9 1 okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m01s)
00:51:01

[very often actually it'll be a bite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m05s)
00:51:05

[between Norton 255 or sometimes it might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m09s)
00:51:09

[be a float between naught and 1 it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[doesn't really matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m15s)
00:51:15

[by the time it gets to PI torch we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m16s)
00:51:16

[generally dealing with floats so we if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m18s)
00:51:18

[one of the steps we often will take will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m22s)
00:51:22

[be to convert it to a number between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m24s)
00:51:24

[naught 1 so then you can see I've just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m25s)
00:51:25

[use conditional formatting in Excel to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m29s)
00:51:29

[kind of make the higher numbers more red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m32s)
00:51:32

[so you can clearly see that this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m34s)
00:51:34

[red this is a 7 but but it's just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m36s)
00:51:36

[bunch of numbers that have been imported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m40s)
00:51:40

[into Excel okay so here's our input so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m42s)
00:51:42

[remember what at a via did was he then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m49s)
00:51:49

[applied two filters right with different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m52s)
00:51:52

[shapes so here I've created a filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m55s)
00:51:55

[which is designed to detect top edges so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h51m58s)
00:51:58

[this is a 3 by 3 filter okay and I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m02s)
00:52:02

[got ones along the top zeroes in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m05s)
00:52:05

[middle minus ones at the bottom right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m07s)
00:52:07

[let's take a look at an example that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m10s)
00:52:10

[here right and so if I hit that - you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m11s)
00:52:11

[can see here highlighted this is the 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m16s)
00:52:16

[by 3 part of the input that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m19s)
00:52:19

[particular thing is calculating right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m22s)
00:52:22

[here you can see it's got 1 1 1 are all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m24s)
00:52:24

[being multiplied by 1 and point 1 0 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m28s)
00:52:28

[are all being multiplied by negative 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m32s)
00:52:32

[okay so in other words all the positive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m35s)
00:52:35

[bits are getting a lot of positive the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m37s)
00:52:37

[negative bits are getting nearly nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m39s)
00:52:39

[at all so we end up with a high number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m41s)
00:52:41

[okay where else on the other side of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m44s)
00:52:44

[this bit of the 7 right you can see how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m47s)
00:52:47

[you know this is basically zeros here or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m51s)
00:52:51

[perhaps more interestingly on the top of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m54s)
00:52:54

[it okay here we've got high numbers at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h52m56s)
00:52:56

[the top but we've also got high numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m04s)
00:53:04

[at the bottom which are negating it ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m06s)
00:53:06

[so you can see that the only place that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m08s)
00:53:08

[we end up activating is where we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m10s)
00:53:10

[actually at an edge so in this case this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[here this number 3 this is called an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m19s)
00:53:19

[activation ok so when I say an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m22s)
00:53:22

[activation I mean ah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m25s)
00:53:25

[at number a number that is calculated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m28s)
00:53:28

[and it is calculated by taking some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m33s)
00:53:33

[numbers from the input and applying some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m38s)
00:53:38

[kind of linear operation in this case a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m42s)
00:53:42

[convolutional kernel to calculate an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m46s)
00:53:46

[output right you'll notice that other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m48s)
00:53:48

[than going inputs multiplied by kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m52s)
00:53:52

[and summing it together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m56s)
00:53:56

[right so here's my some and here's my x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h53m59s)
00:53:59

[then take that and I go max of 0 comma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m03s)
00:54:03

[that and so that's my rectified linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m07s)
00:54:07

[unit so it sounds very fancy rectified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m10s)
00:54:10

[linear unit but what they actually mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m13s)
00:54:13

[is open up Excel and type equals max 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m15s)
00:54:15

[comma C ok that's all about then you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m17s)
00:54:17

[see people in the biz so to say value a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m22s)
00:54:22

[so ral you means rectified linear unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m25s)
00:54:25

[means max 0 comma thing and I'm not like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m28s)
00:54:28

[simplifying it I really mean it like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m32s)
00:54:32

[when I say like if I'm simplifying I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m34s)
00:54:34

[always say so I'm simplifying but if I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m36s)
00:54:36

[not saying I'm simplifying that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m38s)
00:54:38

[entirety okay so a rectified linear unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m40s)
00:54:40

[in its entirety is this and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m42s)
00:54:42

[convolution in its entirety is is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m45s)
00:54:45

[okay so a single layer of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m50s)
00:54:50

[convolutional neural network is being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m54s)
00:54:54

[implemented in its entirety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h54m57s)
00:54:57

[here in Excel okay and so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m00s)
00:55:00

[what it's done is it's deleted pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m03s)
00:55:03

[much the vertical edges and highlighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m06s)
00:55:06

[the horizontal edges so again this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m09s)
00:55:09

[assuming that our network is trained and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m12s)
00:55:12

[that at the end of training it a created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m15s)
00:55:15

[a convolutional filter with these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m18s)
00:55:18

[specific line numbers in and so here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m20s)
00:55:20

[a second convolutional filter it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m24s)
00:55:24

[a different line numbers now pi torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m28s)
00:55:28

[doesn't store them as two separate nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m32s)
00:55:32

[digit arrays it stores it as a tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m35s)
00:55:35

[right remember a tensor just means an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m38s)
00:55:38

[array with more dimensions okay you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m41s)
00:55:41

[use the word array as well it's the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m46s)
00:55:46

[thing but in pi torch they always use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m50s)
00:55:50

[the word tensor so I'm going to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[cancer okay so it's just a tensor with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m54s)
00:55:54

[an additional axis which allows us to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m57s)
00:55:57

[stack each of these filters together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h55m59s)
00:55:59

[right filter and kernel pretty much mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m02s)
00:56:02

[the same thing yeah right it refers to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m07s)
00:56:07

[one of these three by three matrices or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m09s)
00:56:09

[one of these three by three slices of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m13s)
00:56:13

[three dimensional tensor so if I take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m17s)
00:56:17

[this one and here I've literally just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m19s)
00:56:19

[copied the formulas in Excel from above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m22s)
00:56:22

[okay and so you can see this one is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m23s)
00:56:23

[finding a vertebra which as we would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m27s)
00:56:27

[expect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m30s)
00:56:30

[okay so we've now created one layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m31s)
00:56:31

[right this here is a layer them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m40s)
00:56:40

[specifically we'd say it's a hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m42s)
00:56:42

[layer which is it's not an input layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m44s)
00:56:44

[and it's not an output layer so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m46s)
00:56:46

[everything else is a hidden layer okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m48s)
00:56:48

[and this particular hidden layer has is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m50s)
00:56:50

[a size two on this dimension right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m55s)
00:56:55

[because it has two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h56m59s)
00:56:59

[filters right two kernels so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m02s)
00:57:02

[happens next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m07s)
00:57:07

[well let's do another one okay so as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m09s)
00:57:09

[kind of go along things can multiply a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m14s)
00:57:14

[little bit in complexity right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m17s)
00:57:17

[my next filter is going to have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m20s)
00:57:20

[contain two of these three by threes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m23s)
00:57:23

[because I'm gonna have to say how do I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m27s)
00:57:27

[want to bring Adam I want to write these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m28s)
00:57:28

[three things and at the same time how do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m31s)
00:57:31

[I want to wait the corresponding three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m34s)
00:57:34

[things down here right because in pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m36s)
00:57:36

[torch this is going to be this whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m38s)
00:57:38

[thing here is going to be stored as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m41s)
00:57:41

[multi-dimensional tensor right so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m44s)
00:57:44

[shouldn't really think of this now as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m46s)
00:57:46

[two 3x3 kernels but one two by three by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m48s)
00:57:48

[three eternal okay so to calculate this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m54s)
00:57:54

[value here I've got the sum product of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h57m58s)
00:57:58

[all of that plus the sum product of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m02s)
00:58:02

[scroll down all of that okay and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m09s)
00:58:09

[top ones are being multiplied by this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m17s)
00:58:17

[part of the kernel and the bottom ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m19s)
00:58:19

[have been multiplied by this part of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m21s)
00:58:21

[kernel and so over time you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m22s)
00:58:22

[start to get very comfortable with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m25s)
00:58:25

[idea of these like higher dimensional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m28s)
00:58:28

[linear combinations right like it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m31s)
00:58:31

[harder to draw it on the screen like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m35s)
00:58:35

[had to put one above the other but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m37s)
00:58:37

[conceptually just stuck it in your mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m40s)
00:58:40

[like this that's really how you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m42s)
00:58:42

[think right and actually Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m44s)
00:58:44

[in his original 2012 neural Nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m47s)
00:58:47

[Coursera class has a tip which is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m50s)
00:58:50

[all computer scientists deal with like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m54s)
00:58:54

[very high dimensional spaces which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m56s)
00:58:56

[that they basically just visualize the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h58m58s)
00:58:58

[two-dimensional space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m01s)
00:59:01

[and then say like twelve dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m01s)
00:59:01

[really fast and they had lots of tires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[so that's it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m06s)
00:59:06

[right we can see two dimensions on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m08s)
00:59:08

[screen and then you're just going to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[to trust that you can have more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m11s)
00:59:11

[dimensions like the Const](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m14s)
00:59:14

[it's just you know there's there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m15s)
00:59:15

[nothing different about them and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m17s)
00:59:17

[can see in Excel you know Excel doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[have the ability to handle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m21s)
00:59:21

[three-dimensional tensors so I had to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m23s)
00:59:23

[like say okay take this two-dimensional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m25s)
00:59:25

[dot product add on this two-dimensional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m27s)
00:59:27

[dot product right but if there was some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m31s)
00:59:31

[kind of 3d Excel I could have to stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m33s)
00:59:33

[that in a single line all right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[again apply max 0 comma otherwise known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m38s)
00:59:38

[as rectified linear unit otherwise known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m42s)
00:59:42

[as value okay so here is my second layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m44s)
00:59:44

[and so when people create different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m48s)
00:59:48

[architectures write an architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m51s)
00:59:51

[means like how big is your kernel at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m54s)
00:59:54

[layer 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m59s)
00:59:59

[how many filters are in your kernel at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=00h59m59s)
00:59:59

[layer 1 so here I've got a 3 by 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m02s)
01:00:02

[where's number 1 and a 3 by 3 there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m04s)
01:00:04

[number 2 so like this architecture I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m08s)
01:00:08

[created starts off with 2 3 by 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m11s)
01:00:11

[convolutional kernels and then my second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m15s)
01:00:15

[layer has another two kernels of size 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m20s)
01:00:20

[by 3 by 3 so there's the first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m25s)
01:00:25

[and then down here here's a second 2 by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m27s)
01:00:27

[3 by 3 kernel okay and so remember one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m30s)
01:00:30

[of these specific any one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m34s)
01:00:34

[numbers is an activation okay so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m35s)
01:00:35

[activation is being calculated from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m40s)
01:00:40

[these three things here and other 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m43s)
01:00:43

[things up there and we're using these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m45s)
01:00:45

[this 2 by 3 by 3 kernel okay and so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m47s)
01:00:47

[tends to happen is people generally give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m52s)
01:00:52

[names to their layers so I say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m55s)
01:00:55

[let's call this layer here con 1 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h00m57s)
01:00:57

[this layer here and this and this layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m01s)
01:01:01

[here con - all right so that's you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m07s)
01:01:07

[but generally you'll just see that like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m11s)
01:01:11

[when you print out a summary of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m13s)
01:01:13

[network every layer will have some kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m15s)
01:01:15

[of name okay and so then what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m17s)
01:01:17

[next well part of the architecture is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m22s)
01:01:22

[like do you have some max pooling where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m26s)
01:01:26

[bounces up Matt spalling happen so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m28s)
01:01:28

[this architecture we're inventing we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m30s)
01:01:30

[going to next step is do max fully okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m32s)
01:01:32

[Matt spooling is a little hard to kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m36s)
01:01:36

[of show in Excel but we've got it so max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m40s)
01:01:40

[pooling if I do a two by two max pooling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m43s)
01:01:43

[it's going to have the resolution both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m45s)
01:01:45

[height and width so you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m49s)
01:01:49

[that I've replaced these four numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m51s)
01:01:51

[with the maximum of those four numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h01m57s)
01:01:57

[right and so because I'm having the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m00s)
01:02:00

[resolution it only makes sense to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m02s)
01:02:02

[actually have something every two cells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m04s)
01:02:04

[okay so you can see here the way I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m06s)
01:02:06

[got kind of the same looking shape as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m10s)
01:02:10

[had back here okay but it's now half the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m13s)
01:02:13

[resolution so for placed every two by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m15s)
01:02:15

[two with its max and you'll notice like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m19s)
01:02:19

[it's not every possible two by two I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m22s)
01:02:22

[skip over from here so this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m24s)
01:02:24

[starting at beat Hugh and then the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m26s)
01:02:26

[one starts at BS right so they're like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m29s)
01:02:29

[non-overlapping that's why it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m33s)
01:02:33

[decreasing the resolution okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m35s)
01:02:35

[so anybody who's comfortable with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m38s)
01:02:38

[spreadsheets you know you can open this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m39s)
01:02:39

[and have a look and so after our max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m43s)
01:02:43

[pooling there's a number of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m45s)
01:02:45

[things we could do next and I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m52s)
01:02:52

[show you a kind of classic old style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m54s)
01:02:54

[approach nowadays in fact what generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h02m58s)
01:02:58

[happens nowadays is we do a max pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m00s)
01:03:00

[where we kind of like max across the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[entire size right but on older](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m04s)
01:03:04

[architectures and also on all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m08s)
01:03:08

[structured data stuff we do we actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m10s)
01:03:10

[do something called a fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m12s)
01:03:12

[layer and so here's a fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m14s)
01:03:14

[layer I'm going to take every single one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m16s)
01:03:16

[of these activations and I've got to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m19s)
01:03:19

[give every single one of them or weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m22s)
01:03:22

[right and so then I'm going to take over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m24s)
01:03:24

[here here is the sum product of every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m28s)
01:03:28

[one of the activations by every one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m33s)
01:03:33

[the weights for both of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m35s)
01:03:35

[two levels of my three-dimensional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m40s)
01:03:40

[tensor right and so this is called a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m43s)
01:03:43

[fully connected layer notice it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[different to a convolution I'm not going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[through a few at a time right but I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m49s)
01:03:49

[creating a really big weight matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m51s)
01:03:51

[right so rather than having a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m54s)
01:03:54

[little 3x3 kernels my weight matrix is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m57s)
01:03:57

[now as big as the entire input and so as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h03m59s)
01:03:59

[you can imagine architectures that make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m03s)
01:04:03

[heavy use of fully convolutional layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m07s)
01:04:07

[can have a lot of weights which means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m09s)
01:04:09

[they can have trouble with overfitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m13s)
01:04:13

[and they can also be slow and so you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m15s)
01:04:15

[going to see a lot an architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m17s)
01:04:17

[called vgg because it was the first kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m20s)
01:04:20

[of successful deeper architecture it has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m23s)
01:04:23

[up to 19 layers and vgg actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m25s)
01:04:25

[contains a fully connected layer with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[4096 weights connected to a hidden layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[with 4,000 sorry 4096 activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m35s)
01:04:35

[connected to a hidden layer with 4096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m39s)
01:04:39

[activations so you've got like 4096 by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m42s)
01:04:42

[4096 x remember or apply it by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m46s)
01:04:46

[number of kind of kernels that we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m50s)
01:04:50

[calculated so in vgg there's this I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m53s)
01:04:53

[think it's like 300 million weights of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h04m59s)
01:04:59

[which something like 250 million of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m03s)
01:05:03

[are in these fully connected layers so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m06s)
01:05:06

[we'll learn later on in the course about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m09s)
01:05:09

[how we can kind of avoid using these big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m11s)
01:05:11

[fully connected layers and behind the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m13s)
01:05:13

[scenes all the stuff that you've seen us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m15s)
01:05:15

[using like ResNet and res next none of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m17s)
01:05:17

[them use very large fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m20s)
01:05:20

[layers you know you had a question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m22s)
01:05:22

[sorry yeah come on um so could you tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m26s)
01:05:26

[us more about for example if we had like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[three channels for the input what would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m32s)
01:05:32

[be the shape yeah these filters right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m34s)
01:05:34

[that's a great question so if we have 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m40s)
01:05:40

[channels of input it would look exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m42s)
01:05:42

[like conv one right cons one kind of has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m44s)
01:05:44

[two channels right and so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m48s)
01:05:48

[with cons one we had two channels so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m52s)
01:05:52

[therefore our filters had to have like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m54s)
01:05:54

[two channels per filter and so you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h05m57s)
01:05:57

[like imagine that this input didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m00s)
01:06:00

[exist you know and actually this was the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m02s)
01:06:02

[airport alright so when you have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m05s)
01:06:05

[multi-channel input it just means that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m06s)
01:06:06

[your filters look like this and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m09s)
01:06:09

[images often full color they have three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m11s)
01:06:11

[red green and blue sometimes they also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m15s)
01:06:15

[have an alpha Channel so however many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m17s)
01:06:17

[you have that's how many inputs you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m20s)
01:06:20

[and so something which I know Jeanette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m23s)
01:06:23

[was playing with recently was like using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m25s)
01:06:25

[a full color image net model in medical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m27s)
01:06:27

[imaging for something called bone age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m32s)
01:06:32

[calculations which has a single channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[and so what she did was basically take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m36s)
01:06:36

[the the input the the single channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m38s)
01:06:38

[input and make three copies of it so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m42s)
01:06:42

[end up with basically like one two three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m45s)
01:06:45

[versions of the same thing which is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m48s)
01:06:48

[it's kind of a small idea like it's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m52s)
01:06:52

[of redundant information that we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m55s)
01:06:55

[quite want but it does mean that then if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m57s)
01:06:57

[you had a something that expected a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h06m59s)
01:06:59

[three channel convolutional filter you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m01s)
01:07:01

[can use it right and so at the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m05s)
01:07:05

[there's a cable competition for iceberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m08s)
01:07:08

[detection using a some funky satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m11s)
01:07:11

[specific data format that has two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m15s)
01:07:15

[channels so here's how you could do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m17s)
01:07:17

[you could either copy one of those two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m20s)
01:07:20

[channels into the third channel or I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m23s)
01:07:23

[think what people in Carroll are doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m25s)
01:07:25

[is to take the average of the two again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m27s)
01:07:27

[it's not ideal but it's a way that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m30s)
01:07:30

[can use pre-trained networks yeah I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[done a lot of fiddling around like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m37s)
01:07:37

[you can also actually I've actually done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m40s)
01:07:40

[things where I wanted to use a three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m42s)
01:07:42

[channel image net Network on four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m45s)
01:07:45

[channel data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m47s)
01:07:47

[I had a satellite data where the fourth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m48s)
01:07:48

[channel was near-infrared and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m50s)
01:07:50

[basically I added an extra kind of level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m53s)
01:07:53

[to my convolutional kernels that were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[all zeros and so basically like started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m02s)
01:08:02

[off by ignoring the near-infrared band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m04s)
01:08:04

[and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m06s)
01:08:06

[so what happens it basically and you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m08s)
01:08:08

[see this next week is that rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m10s)
01:08:10

[having these like carefully trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m13s)
01:08:13

[filters when you're actually training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m15s)
01:08:15

[something from scratch we're actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m17s)
01:08:17

[going to start with random numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m19s)
01:08:19

[that's actually what we do we actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m21s)
01:08:21

[start with random numbers and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m23s)
01:08:23

[use this thing called stochastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m25s)
01:08:25

[gradient descent which we've kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[seen conceptually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m27s)
01:08:27

[to slightly improve those random numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m29s)
01:08:29

[to make them less random and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m31s)
01:08:31

[basically do that again and again and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m33s)
01:08:33

[again okay great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m35s)
01:08:35

[let's take a seven minute break and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m37s)
01:08:37

[we'll come back at 7:50 all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m39s)
01:08:39

[what happens next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m48s)
01:08:48

[so we've got as far as doing a fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m50s)
01:08:50

[connected layer right so we had our the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h08m57s)
01:08:57

[results of our max pooling layer got fed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m00s)
01:09:00

[to a fully connected layer and he might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m02s)
01:09:02

[notice those of you that remember your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m04s)
01:09:04

[linear algebra the fully connected layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m07s)
01:09:07

[is actually doing a classic traditional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m09s)
01:09:09

[matrix product okay so it's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m11s)
01:09:11

[just going through each pair in turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m14s)
01:09:14

[multiplying them together and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m17s)
01:09:17

[adding them up to do a matrix product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m19s)
01:09:19

[now in practice if we want to calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m23s)
01:09:23

[which one of the ten digits we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m33s)
01:09:33

[looking at their single number we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m36s)
01:09:36

[calculated isn't enough we would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m40s)
01:09:40

[actually calculate ten numbers so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m44s)
01:09:44

[we will have is rather than just having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m48s)
01:09:48

[one set of fully connected weights like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m50s)
01:09:50

[this and I say set because remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m55s)
01:09:55

[there's like a whole 3d kind of tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h09m57s)
01:09:57

[of them we would actually need ten of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m00s)
01:10:00

[those right so you can see that these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m04s)
01:10:04

[tensors start to get a little bit high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m06s)
01:10:06

[dimensional right and so this is where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m09s)
01:10:09

[my patients we're doing it next cell ran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[out but imagine that I had done this ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m14s)
01:10:14

[times I could now have ten different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m17s)
01:10:17

[numbers or being calculated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m19s)
01:10:19

[yeah using exactly the same process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[right we'll just be ten of these fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m23s)
01:10:23

[connected to by m-by-n erased basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m27s)
01:10:27

[and so then we would have ten numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m35s)
01:10:35

[being spat out so what happens next so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m40s)
01:10:40

[next up we can open up a different Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m44s)
01:10:44

[worksheet entropy example dot XLS that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m48s)
01:10:48

[got two different worksheets one of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m52s)
01:10:52

[is called soft mass and what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m56s)
01:10:56

[here sorry I've changed domains rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h10m59s)
01:10:59

[than predicting whether it's the number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m02s)
01:11:02

[from one not to nine I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m04s)
01:11:04

[predict whether something is a cat a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m06s)
01:11:06

[a plane of Fisher Building okay so out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m07s)
01:11:07

[of our that fully connected layer we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m10s)
01:11:10

[got this case we'd have five numbers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[notice at this point there's no rail you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m16s)
01:11:16

[okay in the last layer there's no rail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m20s)
01:11:20

[you okay so I can have negatives so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m23s)
01:11:23

[want to turn these five numbers H into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m27s)
01:11:27

[probability I want to turn it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m32s)
01:11:32

[probability from naught to one that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m34s)
01:11:34

[a cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m37s)
01:11:37

[that's a dog there's a plane that it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m37s)
01:11:37

[fish that it's a building and I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m40s)
01:11:40

[those probabilities to have a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[characteristics first is that each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m44s)
01:11:44

[them should be between zero and one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m45s)
01:11:45

[the second is that this state together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m48s)
01:11:48

[should add up to one right it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m50s)
01:11:50

[definitely one of these five things okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m52s)
01:11:52

[so to do that we use a different kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m55s)
01:11:55

[activation function what's an activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h11m58s)
01:11:58

[function an activation function is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m01s)
01:12:01

[function that is applied to activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m04s)
01:12:04

[so for example max 0 comma something is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m07s)
01:12:07

[a function that I applied to an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m13s)
01:12:13

[activation so an activation function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m16s)
01:12:16

[always takes in one number and spits out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m18s)
01:12:18

[one number so max of 0 comma X takes in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m23s)
01:12:23

[a number X and spits out some different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m27s)
01:12:27

[number value of s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[that's all an activation function is and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m33s)
01:12:33

[if you remember back to that PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m35s)
01:12:35

[we saw in Lesson one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m39s)
01:12:39

[each of our layers was just a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m45s)
01:12:45

[function and then after every layer we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m50s)
01:12:50

[said we needed some non-linearity act as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m55s)
01:12:55

[if you stack a bunch of linear layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h12m58s)
01:12:58

[together right then all you end up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m01s)
01:13:01

[is a linear layer okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m04s)
01:13:04

[so somebody's talking can can you not a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[slow just acting thank you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m09s)
01:13:09

[if you stack a number of linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m13s)
01:13:13

[functions together you just end up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m15s)
01:13:15

[a linear function and nobody does any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m18s)
01:13:18

[cool deep learning with displaying your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m20s)
01:13:20

[functions right but remember we also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m22s)
01:13:22

[learnt that by stacking linear functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m24s)
01:13:24

[with between each one a non-linearity we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m29s)
01:13:29

[could create like arbitrarily complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m33s)
01:13:33

[shapes and so the non-linearity that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m34s)
01:13:34

[we're using after every hidden layer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m37s)
01:13:37

[a rally rectified linear unit a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m39s)
01:13:39

[non-linearity is an activation function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m42s)
01:13:42

[an activation function is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m45s)
01:13:45

[non-linearity in with in deep way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m48s)
01:13:48

[obviously there's lots of other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m51s)
01:13:51

[nonlinearities and in the world but in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m52s)
01:13:52

[deep learning this is what we mean so an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m54s)
01:13:54

[activation function is any function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[takes some activation in as a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m00s)
01:14:00

[number and spits out some new activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[like max of 0 comma so I'm now going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m04s)
01:14:04

[tell you about a different activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m08s)
01:14:08

[function it's slightly more complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m10s)
01:14:10

[than value but not too much it's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m12s)
01:14:12

[soft max soft max only ever occurs in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m16s)
01:14:16

[the final layer at the very end and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m19s)
01:14:19

[reason why is that soft max always spits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m22s)
01:14:22

[out numbers as an activation function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m24s)
01:14:24

[that always spits out a number between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m27s)
01:14:27

[Norton 1 and it always spits out a bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m29s)
01:14:29

[of numbers that add to 1 so a soft max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m32s)
01:14:32

[gives us what we want right in theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m35s)
01:14:35

[this isn't strictly necessary right like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m39s)
01:14:39

[we could ask our neural net to learn a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m43s)
01:14:43

[set of kernels which have you know which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m46s)
01:14:46

[which give probabilities that line up as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m50s)
01:14:50

[closely as possible with what we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m53s)
01:14:53

[but in general with deep learning if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m54s)
01:14:54

[can construct your architecture so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m57s)
01:14:57

[the desired characteristics are as easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h14m59s)
01:14:59

[to express as possible you'll end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m03s)
01:15:03

[with better models like they'll learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m06s)
01:15:06

[more quickly with less parameters so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m07s)
01:15:07

[this case we know that our probabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m10s)
01:15:10

[should end up being between 9 1 we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m13s)
01:15:13

[that they should end up adding to 1 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m16s)
01:15:16

[if we construct an activation function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m18s)
01:15:18

[which always has those features then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[we're going to make our neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m23s)
01:15:23

[do a better job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m24s)
01:15:24

[it's gonna make it easier for it it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m26s)
01:15:26

[doesn't have to learn to do those things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m27s)
01:15:27

[because it all happen automatically okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m29s)
01:15:29

[so in order to make this work we first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m32s)
01:15:32

[of all have to get rid of all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m37s)
01:15:37

[negatives right like we can't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m39s)
01:15:39

[negative probabilities so to make things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m41s)
01:15:41

[not being negative one way we could do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m44s)
01:15:44

[it is just go into the pair of right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m46s)
01:15:46

[here you can see my first step is to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m49s)
01:15:49

[X of the previous one right and I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m51s)
01:15:51

[I've mentioned this before but of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m55s)
01:15:55

[the math that you just need to be super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h15m58s)
01:15:58

[familiar with to do deep learning the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m01s)
01:16:01

[one you really need is logarithms and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m03s)
01:16:03

[asks write all of deep learning and all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m05s)
01:16:05

[of machine learning they appear all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[time right so for example you absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m10s)
01:16:10

[need to know that log of x times y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m19s)
01:16:19

[equals log of X plus log of Y all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m24s)
01:16:24

[and like not just know that that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m33s)
01:16:33

[formula that exists but have a sense of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m35s)
01:16:35

[like what does that mean why is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m37s)
01:16:37

[interesting oh I can turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m39s)
01:16:39

[multiplications into additions that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m41s)
01:16:41

[could be really handy right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m42s)
01:16:42

[therefore log of x over y equals log of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m45s)
01:16:45

[X minus log of Y again that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m50s)
01:16:50

[come in pretty handy you know rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[than dividing I can just subtract things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m57s)
01:16:57

[right and also remember that if I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h16m59s)
01:16:59

[log of x equals y then that means a to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m03s)
01:17:03

[the y equals x in other words log log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m08s)
01:17:08

[and E to the for the inverse of each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m14s)
01:17:14

[other okay again you just you need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[really really understand these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[and like so if you if you haven't spent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m23s)
01:17:23

[much time with logs and X for a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m25s)
01:17:25

[try plotting them in Excel or a notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m27s)
01:17:27

[have a sense of what shape they are how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m31s)
01:17:31

[they combine together just make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m33s)
01:17:33

[you're really comfortable with them so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[we're using it here right we're using it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[here so one of the things that we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m42s)
01:17:42

[is a to the power of something is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m44s)
01:17:44

[positive okay so that's great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m46s)
01:17:46

[the other thing you'll notice about e to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m49s)
01:17:49

[the power of something is because it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m50s)
01:17:50

[power numbers that are slightly bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m52s)
01:17:52

[than other numbers like four is a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[bit bigger than 2.8 when you go e to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h17m58s)
01:17:58

[power of it really accentuates that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m00s)
01:18:00

[difference okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m02s)
01:18:02

[so we're going to take advantage of both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m04s)
01:18:04

[of these features for the purpose of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m05s)
01:18:05

[deep learning okay so we take our the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m06s)
01:18:06

[results of this fully connected layer we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m10s)
01:18:10

[go e to the power of for each of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m13s)
01:18:13

[and then we're gonna yeah and then we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m15s)
01:18:15

[going to add them up okay so here is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m24s)
01:18:24

[sum of e to the power of so then here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m28s)
01:18:28

[we're going to take e to the power of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m32s)
01:18:32

[divided by the sum of e to the power of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m35s)
01:18:35

[so if you take all of these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m37s)
01:18:37

[divided by their sum then by definition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m41s)
01:18:41

[all of those things must add up to 1 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m43s)
01:18:43

[furthermore since we're dividing by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m49s)
01:18:49

[their sum they must always vary between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m51s)
01:18:51

[0 and 1 because they were always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m54s)
01:18:54

[positive alright and that's it so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m56s)
01:18:56

[what softmax is ok so I've got this kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h18m59s)
01:18:59

[of doing random numbers each time right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m04s)
01:19:04

[and so you can see like as I as I look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m08s)
01:19:08

[through my softmax generally has quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m11s)
01:19:11

[few things that are so close to zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m14s)
01:19:14

[that they round down to zero and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m16s)
01:19:16

[know maybe one thing that's nearly 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m19s)
01:19:19

[right and the reason for that is what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m20s)
01:19:20

[just talked about that is with the X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m23s)
01:19:23

[just having one number a bit bigger than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m25s)
01:19:25

[the others tends to like push it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m28s)
01:19:28

[further right so even though my inputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m30s)
01:19:30

[here around on numbers between negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m33s)
01:19:33

[5 and 5 right my outputs from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m35s)
01:19:35

[softmax don't really look that random at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m39s)
01:19:39

[all in the sense that they tend to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m41s)
01:19:41

[one big number and a bunch of small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m44s)
01:19:44

[numbers and now that's what we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m47s)
01:19:47

[right we want to say like in terms of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m50s)
01:19:50

[like is this a cat a dog a plane a fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m53s)
01:19:53

[or a building we really want it to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m55s)
01:19:55

[like it's it's that you know it's it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h19m57s)
01:19:57

[dog or it's a plane not like I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[know okay so softmax has lots of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m03s)
01:20:03

[cool properties right it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m07s)
01:20:07

[return a probability that adds up to 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m10s)
01:20:10

[and it's going to tend to want to pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m12s)
01:20:12

[one thing particularly strongly okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m14s)
01:20:14

[that's soft mess your net could you pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[actually bust me up we how would we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m22s)
01:20:22

[something that as let's say you have any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m29s)
01:20:29

[imaging you want to count in categorize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m31s)
01:20:31

[I was like cat and the dog or like has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m32s)
01:20:32

[multiple things but what kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m34s)
01:20:34

[function will we try to use so happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m37s)
01:20:37

[we're going to do that right now so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m40s)
01:20:40

[so hope you think about why we might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m45s)
01:20:45

[want to do that and so runways where you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m47s)
01:20:47

[might want to do that is to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m48s)
01:20:48

[multi-label classification so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m50s)
01:20:50

[looking now at listen to image models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m53s)
01:20:53

[and specifically we're going to take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m54s)
01:20:54

[look at the planet competition satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h20m57s)
01:20:57

[imaging competition now the satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m00s)
01:21:00

[imaging competition has some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m04s)
01:21:04

[similarities to stuff we've seen before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m08s)
01:21:08

[right so before we've seen cat versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m09s)
01:21:09

[dog and these images are a cat or a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m13s)
01:21:13

[they're not Maya they're not both right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m15s)
01:21:15

[but the satellite imaging competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m19s)
01:21:19

[has stayed as images that look like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m22s)
01:21:22

[and in fact every single one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m25s)
01:21:25

[images is classified by whether there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m27s)
01:21:27

[four kinds of weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[one of which is haze and another of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m31s)
01:21:31

[which is clear in addition to which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m34s)
01:21:34

[there is a list of features that may be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m37s)
01:21:37

[present including agriculture which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m39s)
01:21:39

[like some some cleared area used for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m42s)
01:21:42

[agriculture primary which means primary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m44s)
01:21:44

[rainforest and water which means a river](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m48s)
01:21:48

[or a creek so here is a clear day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m50s)
01:21:50

[satellite image showing some agriculture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m54s)
01:21:54

[some primary rainforest and some water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m56s)
01:21:56

[features and here's one which is in haze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h21m59s)
01:21:59

[and is entirely primary rainforest so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m02s)
01:22:02

[this case we're going to want to be able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m07s)
01:22:07

[to show we're going to predict multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m09s)
01:22:09

[things and so softmax wouldn't be good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[because softmax doesn't like predicting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m15s)
01:22:15

[multiple things and like I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m19s)
01:22:19

[definitely recommend anthropomorphizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m21s)
01:22:21

[your activation functions right they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m23s)
01:22:23

[have personalities okay and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m25s)
01:22:25

[personality of the softmax is it wants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m28s)
01:22:28

[to pick a thing and people forget this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m30s)
01:22:30

[all the time I've seen many people even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m34s)
01:22:34

[well-regarded researchers in famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m36s)
01:22:36

[academic papers using like soft maps for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m39s)
01:22:39

[multi-label classification it happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m44s)
01:22:44

[all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m46s)
01:22:46

[right and it's kind of ridiculous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m46s)
01:22:46

[because they're not understanding the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m49s)
01:22:49

[personality of their activation function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m52s)
01:22:52

[so for multi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m55s)
01:22:55

[classification where each sample can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h22m58s)
01:22:58

[belong to one or more classes we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m00s)
01:23:00

[change a few things but here's the good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m03s)

[anything right so fast AI will look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m08s)
01:23:08

[the labels in the CSV and if there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m12s)
01:23:12

[more than one label ever for any item it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m15s)
01:23:15

[will automatically switch into like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m21s)
01:23:21

[multi-label mode so I'm going to show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m23s)
01:23:23

[you how it works behind the scenes but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m25s)
01:23:25

[the good news is you don't actually have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m27s)
01:23:27

[to care it happens anywhere so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m29s)
01:23:29

[have multi label images multi label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m35s)
01:23:35

[objects you obviously can't use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m40s)
01:23:40

[classic Kerris style approach where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m43s)
01:23:43

[things are in folders because something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m46s)
01:23:46

[can't conveniently be in multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m48s)
01:23:48

[folders at the same time right so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m51s)
01:23:51

[why we you basically have to use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m55s)
01:23:55

[from CSV approach right so if we look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h23m57s)
01:23:57

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m04s)

01:24:06

[to take you through it right so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m12s)
01:24:12

[say okay this is the CSV file containing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m14s)
01:24:14

[our labels this looks exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m16s)
01:24:16

[as I did before but rather than side on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m18s)
01:24:18

[its top down alright and top down I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[mentioned before that can do our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m24s)
01:24:24

[vertical flips it actually does more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m27s)
01:24:27

[than that there's actually eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m28s)
01:24:28

[possible symmetries for a square which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m29s)
01:24:29

[is it can be rotated through 90 180 270](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m32s)
01:24:32

[or 0 degrees and for each of those it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m35s)
01:24:35

[can be flipped and if you think about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m37s)
01:24:37

[for awhile you'll realize that that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m39s)

[complete enumeration of everything that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m42s)
01:24:42

[you can do in terms of symmetries to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m45s)
01:24:45

[square so they're called it's called the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m48s)
01:24:48

[dihedral group of eight so if you see in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m50s)
01:24:50

[the code there's actually a transform or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m53s)
01:24:53

[dihedral that's why it's called that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m55s)
01:24:55

[this transforms will basically do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h24m59s)
01:24:59

[full set of eight symmetric dihedral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[rotations and flips plus everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m05s)
01:25:05

[which we can do to dogs and cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m09s)
01:25:09

[you know small clinical rotations a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m11s)
01:25:11

[little bit of zooming a little bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m13s)
01:25:13

[contrast and brightness adjustment so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m16s)
01:25:16

[these images are a size 256 by 256 so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m18s)
01:25:18

[just create a little function here to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m23s)
01:25:23

[let me quickly grab you know data loader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m24s)
01:25:24

[of any size so here's a 256 by 256 once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m28s)
01:25:28

[you've got a data object inside it we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m32s)
01:25:32

[already seen that there's things called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m36s)
01:25:36

[Val D s test D s train D s there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m37s)
01:25:37

[things that you can just index into and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m41s)
01:25:41

[grab a particular image so you just use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m43s)
01:25:43

[square brackets 0 you'll also see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m45s)
01:25:45

[all of those things have a DL that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m48s)
01:25:48

[data loader so des is data set DL is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m50s)
01:25:50

[data motor these are concepts from PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m53s)
01:25:53

[watch so if you Google PI torch data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m55s)
01:25:55

[or pipe watch data loader you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h25m58s)
01:25:58

[basically see what it means but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m00s)
01:26:00

[basic idea is a data set gives you a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m02s)
01:26:02

[single image or a single object back a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m04s)
01:26:04

[data loader gives you back a mini batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m08s)
01:26:08

[and specifically it gives you back a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m10s)
01:26:10

[transformed mini - so that's why when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m12s)
01:26:12

[create our data object we can pass in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m15s)
01:26:15

[num workers and transforms it's like how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m20s)
01:26:20

[many processes do you want to use what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m24s)
01:26:24

[transforms do you want and so with with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m25s)
01:26:25

[a data loader you can't ask for an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m28s)
01:26:28

[individual image you can only get back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m30s)
01:26:30

[at a mini batch and you can't get back a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m32s)
01:26:32

[particular mini batch you can only get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m35s)
01:26:35

[back the next mini - so something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m37s)
01:26:37

[reverses look through grabbing a mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[batch at a time and so in Python the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m42s)
01:26:42

[thing that does that is called a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m46s)
01:26:46

[generator right or an iterator this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m47s)
01:26:47

[slightly different versions are the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m50s)
01:26:50

[thing so to turn a data loader into an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m51s)
01:26:51

[iterator you use the standard Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m54s)
01:26:54

[function cordetta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m56s)
01:26:56

[that's a Python function just a regular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h26m57s)
01:26:57

[part of the Python basic language that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m00s)
01:27:00

[returns you an iterator and an iterator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m02s)
01:27:02

[is something that takes you can pass the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m04s)
01:27:04

[static give pass it to the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m07s)
01:27:07

[Python function or statement next and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m08s)
01:27:08

[that just says give me another batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m13s)
01:27:13

[from this iterator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m15s)
01:27:15

[so we're basically this is one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m18s)
01:27:18

[things I really like about PI torch is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m21s)
01:27:21

[it really leverages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m23s)
01:27:23

[modern pythons kind of stuff you know in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m24s)
01:27:24

[in tensorflow they invent their whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m28s)
01:27:28

[new world earth ways of doing things and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m31s)
01:27:31

[so it's kind of more in a sense it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m35s)
01:27:35

[more like cross-platform but in another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m38s)
01:27:38

[sense like it's not a good fit to any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m40s)
01:27:40

[platform so it's nice if you if you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m42s)
01:27:42

[Python well PI torch comes very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m46s)
01:27:46

[naturally if you don't know Python well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m49s)
01:27:49

[PI torches are good reason to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m52s)
01:27:52

[Python well a PI torch your module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m53s)
01:27:53

[neural network module is a standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h27m58s)
01:27:58

[Python bus for example so any work you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m00s)
01:28:00

[put into learning Python better will pay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m03s)
01:28:03

[off with paid watch so here I am using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m05s)
01:28:05

[standard Python iterators and next to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m08s)
01:28:08

[grab my next mini batch from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m12s)
01:28:12

[validation sets data loader and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m15s)
01:28:15

[going to return two things it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m17s)
01:28:17

[return the images in the mini batch and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m19s)
01:28:19

[the labels of the mini - so standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m20s)
01:28:20

[Python approach I can pull them apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m23s)
01:28:23

[like so and so here is one mini batch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m25s)
01:28:25

[labels and so not surprisingly since I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m30s)
01:28:30

[said that my batch size let's go ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m34s)
01:28:34

[and find it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m37s)
01:28:37

[Oh actually it's the batch size by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m41s)
01:28:41

[default is 64 so I didn't pass in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m44s)
01:28:44

[batch size and so just remember shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m47s)
01:28:47

[tab to see like what are the things you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m50s)
01:28:50

[can pass and what are the defaults so by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m52s)
01:28:52

[default my batch size is 64 so I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m54s)
01:28:54

[that something of size 64 by 17 so there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h28m57s)
01:28:57

[are 17 of the possible classes right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m01s)
01:29:01

[let's take a look at the zeroth set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m07s)
01:29:07

[labels so the zeroth images labels so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m12s)
01:29:12

[can zip again standard Python things it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m15s)
01:29:15

[takes two lists and combines it so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m18s)
01:29:18

[get the zero theme from the first list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m21s)
01:29:21

[as you're asking for the second list and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m23s)
01:29:23

[the first thing for the first first this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m25s)
01:29:25

[first thing from the second list and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m27s)
01:29:27

[forth so I can zip them together and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m29s)
01:29:29

[that way I can find out for the zeroth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m31s)
01:29:31

[image and the validation set is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m34s)
01:29:34

[agriculture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m36s)
01:29:36

[it's clear its primary rainforest its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m38s)
01:29:38

[slash-and-burn its water okay so as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m42s)
01:29:42

[can see here this is a MOLLE label you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m47s)
01:29:47

[see here's a way to do multi-label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m51s)
01:29:51

[classification so by the same token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m53s)
01:29:53

[right if we go back to our single label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h29m57s)
01:29:57

[classification it's a cat dog playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m01s)
01:30:01

[official building behind the scenes we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m03s)
01:30:03

[haven't actually looked at it but behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m07s)
01:30:07

[the scenes fast AI imply torch are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m08s)
01:30:08

[turning our labels into something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m12s)
01:30:12

[one hot encoded labels and so if it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m15s)
01:30:15

[actually a dog than the actual values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m18s)
01:30:18

[would be like that right so these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m22s)
01:30:22

[like the actuals okay so do you remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m25s)
01:30:25

[at the very end of at AV o--'s video he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m29s)
01:30:29

[showed how like the template had to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m32s)
01:30:32

[match to one of the like five ABCDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m34s)
01:30:34

[templates and so what it's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m36s)
01:30:36

[doing is it's comparing when I said it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[basically doing a dot product it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m42s)
01:30:42

[actually a fully connected layer at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m44s)
01:30:44

[end right that calculates an output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m46s)
01:30:46

[activation that goes through a soft Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m50s)
01:30:50

[and then the soft max is compared to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m52s)
01:30:52

[one hot encoded label right so if it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m56s)
01:30:56

[a dog there would be a one here and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h30m59s)
01:30:59

[we take the difference between the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m03s)
01:31:03

[actuals and the softmax activation is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m05s)
01:31:05

[say and add those add up those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m08s)
01:31:08

[differences to say how much error is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m10s)
01:31:10

[there essentially we're skipping over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m12s)
01:31:12

[something called a loss function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m14s)
01:31:14

[we'll learn about next week but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m16s)
01:31:16

[essentially we're basically doing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m17s)
01:31:17

[now if it's one hot encoded like there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m21s)
01:31:21

[only one thing which have a 1 in it then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m25s)
01:31:25

[actually storing it as 0 1 0 0 0 is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m28s)
01:31:28

[terribly inefficient right like we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m32s)
01:31:32

[basically say what are the index of each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m36s)
01:31:36

[of these things right so we can say it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m38s)
01:31:38

[like 0 1 2 3 4 like so right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m40s)
01:31:40

[rather than storing it is 0 1 0 0 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m44s)
01:31:44

[we actually just store the index value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m48s)
01:31:48

[right so if you look at the the Y values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m52s)
01:31:52

[for the cats and dogs competition or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m56s)
01:31:56

[dog breeds competition you won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h31m58s)
01:31:58

[actually see a big lists of ones and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m01s)
01:32:01

[zeros like this you'll see a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m03s)
01:32:03

[integer right which is like what what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m04s)
01:32:04

[class index is it right and internally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m07s)
01:32:07

[inside pipe arch it will actually turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m11s)
01:32:11

[that into a one hot encoded vector but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m15s)
01:32:15

[like you will literally never see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m17s)
01:32:17

[okay and and pi torch has different loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m19s)
01:32:19

[functions where you basically say this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m23s)
01:32:23

[thing's won this thing is one hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m26s)
01:32:26

[encoder door this thing is not and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m27s)
01:32:27

[uses different bus functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m30s)
01:32:30

[that's all hidden by the faster I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m31s)
01:32:31

[library right so like you don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m34s)
01:32:34

[worry about it but is but the the cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m36s)
01:32:36

[thing to realize is that this approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m40s)
01:32:40

[for multi-label encoding with these ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m42s)
01:32:42

[and zeros behind the scenes the exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m45s)
01:32:45

[same thing happens for single level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m48s)
01:32:48

[classification does it make sense to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m51s)
01:32:51

[change the beginners of the sigmoid of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m56s)
01:32:56

[the softmax function by changing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h32m59s)
01:32:59

[base no because when you change the more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m00s)
01:33:00

[math log base a of B equals log B over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m07s)
01:33:07

[log a so changing the base is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m19s)
01:33:19

[linear scaling and linear scaling is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m24s)
01:33:24

[something which the neural net can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m27s)
01:33:27

[with very easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m29s)
01:33:29

[good question okay so here is that image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m35s)
01:33:35

[right here is the image with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m42s)
01:33:42

[slash-and-burn water etc etc one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m44s)
01:33:44

[things to notice here is like when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m47s)
01:33:47

[first displayed this image it was so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m49s)
01:33:49

[washed out I really couldn't see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m54s)
01:33:54

[right but remember images now you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h33m56s)
01:33:56

[we know images are just matrices of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m00s)
01:34:00

[numbers and so you can see here I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m02s)
01:34:02

[said times 1.4 just to make it more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m04s)
01:34:04

[visible right so like now that you kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m08s)
01:34:08

[of it's the kind of thing I want you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m11s)
01:34:11

[get familiar with is the idea that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m12s)
01:34:12

[stuff you're dealing with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m14s)
01:34:14

[they're just matrices of numbers and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m15s)
01:34:15

[can fiddle around with them so if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m18s)
01:34:18

[looking at something like guys a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m19s)
01:34:19

[washed out you can just multiply it by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m21s)
01:34:21

[something to brighten it up a bit okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[so here we can see I guess this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m25s)
01:34:25

[slash-and-burn here's the river that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[the water here's the primary rainforest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m30s)
01:34:30

[maybe that's the agriculture so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m33s)
01:34:33

[okay so so you know with all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m35s)
01:34:35

[background how do we actually use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m41s)
01:34:41

[exactly the same way as everything we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m44s)
01:34:44

[done before right so you know size and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m46s)
01:34:46

[and the interesting thing about playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m49s)
01:34:49

[around with this planet competition is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m52s)
01:34:52

[that these images are not at all like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m54s)
01:34:54

[image there and I would guess that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h34m56s)
01:34:56

[vast majority is of stuff that the vast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m00s)
01:35:00

[majority of you do involving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m02s)
01:35:02

[convolutional neural Nets won't actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m05s)
01:35:05

[be anything like image net you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m07s)
01:35:07

[it'll be it'll be medical imaging it'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m10s)
01:35:10

[be like classifying different kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m14s)
01:35:14

[steel tube or figuring out whether a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m15s)
01:35:15

[world you know is going to break or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m18s)
01:35:18

[or or looking at satellite images or you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m21s)
01:35:21

[know whatever right so it's it's good to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m25s)
01:35:25

[experiment with stuff like this planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m30s)
01:35:30

[competition to get a sense of kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m32s)
01:35:32

[what you want to do and so you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m35s)
01:35:35

[here I start out by resizing my data to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m37s)
01:35:37

[64 by 64 it starts out at 256 by 256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m40s)
01:35:40

[right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m44s)
01:35:44

[I wouldn't want to do this for the cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m46s)
01:35:46

[and dogs competition because it cats end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m48s)
01:35:48

[on competition we start with a pre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m50s)
01:35:50

[trained imagenet Network it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m52s)
01:35:52

[nearly isn't it starts off nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m54s)
01:35:54

[perfect right so if we resized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h35m57s)
01:35:57

[everything to 64 by 64 and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m00s)
01:36:00

[retrained the whole set regular it we'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m02s)
01:36:02

[basically destroy the weights that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m04s)
01:36:04

[already pre trained to be very good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m07s)
01:36:07

[remember imagenet most imagenet models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m09s)
01:36:09

[are trained at either 224 by 224 or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m12s)
01:36:12

[$2.99 by 299 all right so if we like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m14s)
01:36:14

[retrain them at 64 by 64 we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m17s)
01:36:17

[we're going to kill it on the other hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m20s)
01:36:20

[there's nothing in image net that looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m23s)
01:36:23

[anything like this you know there's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m25s)
01:36:25

[satellite images so the only useful bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m28s)
01:36:28

[of the image net Network for us are kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m31s)
01:36:31

[of layers like this one you know finding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m36s)
01:36:36

[edges and gradients and this one you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m39s)
01:36:39

[know finding kind of textures and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m42s)
01:36:42

[repeating patterns and maybe these ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m44s)
01:36:44

[are kind of finding more complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m48s)
01:36:48

[textures but that's probably about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m49s)
01:36:49

[right so so in other words you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m52s)
01:36:52

[starting out by training very small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h36m57s)
01:36:57

[images works pretty well when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m00s)
01:37:00

[using stuff like satellites so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m02s)
01:37:02

[case I started right back at 64 by 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m04s)
01:37:04

[grab some data built my model found out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m07s)
01:37:07

[what learning rate to use and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m13s)
01:37:13

[interestingly it turned out to be quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m15s)
01:37:15

[high it seems that because like it's so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m17s)
01:37:17

[unlike imagenet I needed to do quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m22s)
01:37:22

[bit more fitting with just that last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m25s)
01:37:25

[layer before it started to flatten out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m28s)
01:37:28

[then I unfreeze dit and again this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m30s)
01:37:30

[the difference to image net like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m33s)
01:37:33

[datasets is my learning rate in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m38s)
01:37:38

[initial layer i set 2/9 the middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m41s)
01:37:41

[layers I said 2/3 where else for stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m44s)
01:37:44

[like it's like image net I had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m47s)
01:37:47

[multiple of 10 each of those you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m48s)
01:37:48

[again the idea being that that earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m52s)
01:37:52

[layers probably and not as close to what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m54s)
01:37:54

[they need to be compared to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h37m58s)
01:37:58

[like dances again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m00s)
01:38:00

[unfreeze train for a while and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m04s)
01:38:04

[kind of see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m08s)
01:38:08

[you know there's cycle one there's cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m09s)
01:38:09

[- there's cycle three and then I kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m11s)
01:38:11

[increased double the size with my images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m14s)
01:38:14

[fit for a while and freeze fit for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m18s)
01:38:18

[while double the size of the images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m21s)
01:38:21

[again fit for a while I'm freeze for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m23s)
01:38:23

[while and then add TTA and so as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m25s)
01:38:25

[mentioned last time we looked at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m28s)
01:38:28

[this process ends up you know getting us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m30s)
01:38:30

[about 30th place in this competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m32s)
01:38:32

[which is really cool because people you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m35s)
01:38:35

[know a lot of very very smart people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m38s)
01:38:38

[just a few months ago worked very very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m39s)
01:38:39

[hard on this competition a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m42s)
01:38:42

[things people have asked about one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m46s)
01:38:46

[what is this data dot resize do so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m51s)
01:38:51

[couple of different pieces here the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m57s)
01:38:57

[first is that when we say back here what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h38m59s)
01:38:59

[transforms do we apply and here's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m05s)
01:39:05

[transforms we actually pass in a size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m07s)
01:39:07

[right so one of the things that that one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m10s)
01:39:10

[of the things that data loaded does is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m12s)
01:39:12

[to resize the images like on-demand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m14s)
01:39:14

[every time it sees them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m17s)
01:39:17

[it's got nothing to do with that dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m21s)
01:39:21

[resize method right so this is this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m22s)
01:39:22

[the thing that happens at the end like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m25s)
01:39:25

[whatever's passed in before it hits out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m27s)
01:39:27

[that before our data loader spits it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m29s)
01:39:29

[it's going to resize it to this size if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m31s)
01:39:31

[the initial input is like a thousand by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m35s)
01:39:35

[a thousand reading that JPEG and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m38s)
01:39:38

[resizing it to 64 by 64 turns out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m41s)
01:39:41

[actually take more time than training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m45s)
01:39:45

[the content that's for each batch all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m48s)
01:39:48

[right so basically all resize does is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m51s)
01:39:51

[says hey I'm not going to be using any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m55s)
01:39:55

[images bigger than size times 1.3 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h39m57s)
01:39:57

[just grow through once and create new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m01s)
01:40:01

[JPEGs of this size right and they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m03s)
01:40:03

[rectangular right so new JPEGs where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m08s)
01:40:08

[smallest edges of this size and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m10s)
01:40:10

[it's like you never have to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m14s)
01:40:14

[there's no reason to ever use it if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m16s)
01:40:16

[don't want to it's just a speed-up okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m19s)
01:40:19

[but if you've got really big images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m21s)
01:40:21

[coming in it saves you a lot of time and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m23s)
01:40:23

[you'll often see on like Carol kernels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m25s)
01:40:25

[or forum posts or whatever people will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m27s)
01:40:27

[have like bash script stuff like that -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m30s)
01:40:30

[like loop through and resize images to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m34s)
01:40:34

[save time you never have to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m36s)
01:40:36

[right just you can just say dot resize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m38s)
01:40:38

[and it'll just create you know once-off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m40s)
01:40:40

[it'll go through and create that if it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m44s)
01:40:44

[already there and it'll use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m46s)
01:40:46

[criticized ones for you okay so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m48s)
01:40:48

[just it's just a speed up convenience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m51s)
01:40:51

[function no more okay so for those of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h40m53s)
01:40:53

[you that are kind of past dog breeds I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m00s)
01:41:00

[would be looking at planet next you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m05s)
01:41:05

[like try it like play around with with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m09s)
01:41:09

[trying to get a sense of like how can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m13s)
01:41:13

[you get this as an accurate model one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m15s)
01:41:15

[thing to mention and I'm not really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m19s)
01:41:19

[going to go into it in details there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m20s)
01:41:20

[nothing to do with deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m21s)
01:41:21

[particularly is that I'm using a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m22s)
01:41:22

[different metric I didn't use metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m24s)
01:41:24

[equals accuracy but I said metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m26s)
01:41:26

[equals f2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m29s)
01:41:29

[remember from last week that confusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m33s)
01:41:33

[matrix that like two by two you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m37s)
01:41:37

[correct incorrect for each of dogs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m39s)
01:41:39

[cats there's a lot of different ways you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m41s)
01:41:41

[could turn that confusion matrix into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m47s)
01:41:47

[score you know do you care more about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m48s)
01:41:48

[false negatives or do you care more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m51s)
01:41:51

[about false positives and how do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m52s)
01:41:52

[weight them and how do you combine them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m54s)
01:41:54

[together right there's a basic there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m55s)
01:41:55

[basically a function called F beta where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h41m59s)
01:41:59

[the beta says how much do you weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m02s)
01:42:02

[false negatives versus false positives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m04s)
01:42:04

[and so f 2 is f beta with beta equals 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m06s)
01:42:06

[and it's basically as particular way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m11s)
01:42:11

[weighting false negatives and false](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m13s)
01:42:13

[positives and the reason we use it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m15s)
01:42:15

[because cattle told us that planet who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m17s)
01:42:17

[are running this competition wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m19s)
01:42:19

[use this particular F beta metric the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m21s)
01:42:21

[important thing for you to know is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m26s)
01:42:26

[you can create custom metrics so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m28s)
01:42:28

[case you can see here it says from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m32s)
01:42:32

[Planet import f2 and really I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m33s)
01:42:33

[this here so that you can see how to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m35s)
01:42:35

[it right so if you look inside courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m38s)
01:42:38

[DL 1 you can see there's something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m43s)
01:42:43

[called planet py right and so if I look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m47s)
01:42:47

[at planet py you'll see there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m51s)
01:42:51

[function there called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m55s)
01:42:55

[f2 right and so f2 simply calls F beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h42m57s)
01:42:57

[score from psychic or side PI and patent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m03s)
01:43:03

[where it came from and does a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m08s)
01:43:08

[little tweets that are particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m12s)
01:43:12

[important but the important thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m13s)
01:43:13

[like you can write any metric you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m17s)
01:43:17

[right as long as it takes in set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m19s)
01:43:19

[predictions and a set of targets and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m23s)
01:43:23

[they're both going to be numpy arrays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m25s)
01:43:25

[one dimensional non pyros and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m27s)
01:43:27

[return back a number okay and so as long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m30s)
01:43:30

[as you put a function that takes two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m33s)
01:43:33

[vectors and returns at number you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m35s)
01:43:35

[call it as a metric and so then when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m38s)
01:43:38

[said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m41s)
01:43:41

[see here learn metrics equals and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m46s)
01:43:46

[past in that array which just contains a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m52s)
01:43:52

[single function f2 then it's just going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m54s)
01:43:54

[to be printed out after every for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h43m57s)
01:43:57

[okay so in general like the the faster I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m00s)
01:44:00

[library everything is customizable so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m03s)
01:44:03

[kind of the idea is that everything is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m06s)
01:44:06

[everything is kind of gives you what you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m11s)
01:44:11

[might want by default but also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m15s)
01:44:15

[everything can be changed as well yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m18s)
01:44:18

[you know um we have a little confusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m23s)
01:44:23

[about the difference between multi-label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m26s)
01:44:26

[and a single label uh-huh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m30s)
01:44:30

[the vanish as an example in which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m32s)
01:44:32

[compared like similarly the example they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m34s)
01:44:34

[just show us ah activation function yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m38s)
01:44:38

[so so I'm so sorry I said I'd do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m42s)
01:44:42

[then I didn't so the activation the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m47s)
01:44:47

[output activation function for a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m49s)
01:44:49

[label classification is softmax but all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m52s)
01:44:52

[the reasons that we talked today but if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m55s)
01:44:55

[we were trying to predict something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h44m58s)
01:44:58

[was like 0 0 1 1 0 then softmax would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m00s)
01:45:00

[a terrible choice because it's very hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m05s)
01:45:05

[to come up with something where both of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m07s)
01:45:07

[these are high in fact it's impossible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m09s)
01:45:09

[because they have to add up to 1 so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m11s)
01:45:11

[closest they could be would be point 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m13s)
01:45:13

[so for multi-label classification our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m15s)
01:45:15

[activation function is called sigmoid ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m19s)
01:45:19

[and again the faster library does this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m23s)
01:45:23

[automatically for you if it notices you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m26s)
01:45:26

[have a multi label problem and it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m28s)
01:45:28

[that by checking your data tip to see if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m32s)
01:45:32

[anything has more than one label applied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m34s)
01:45:34

[to it and so sigmoid is a function which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m36s)
01:45:36

[is equal to it's basically the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m40s)
01:45:40

[thing except rather than we never add up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m44s)
01:45:44

[all of these X but instead we just take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m48s)
01:45:48

[this X when we say it's just equal to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m52s)
01:45:52

[divided by one plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m55s)
01:45:55

[it and so the nice thing about that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h45m59s)
01:45:59

[that now like multiple things can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m05s)
01:46:05

[high at once right and so generally then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m09s)
01:46:09

[if something is less than zero its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m15s)
01:46:15

[sigmoid is going to be less than 0.5 if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m18s)
01:46:18

[it's greater than zero is signal it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m21s)
01:46:21

[going to be greater than 0.5 and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m23s)
01:46:23

[important thing to know about a sigmoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m26s)
01:46:26

[function is that its shape is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m27s)
01:46:27

[something which asymptotes at the top to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m36s)
01:46:36

[one and asymptotes drew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m39s)
01:46:39

[asymptotes at the bottom to zero and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m45s)
01:46:45

[therefore it's a good thing to model a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m52s)
01:46:52

[probability with anybody who has done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m53s)
01:46:53

[any logistic regression will be familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h46m57s)
01:46:57

[with this is what we do in logistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m01s)
01:47:01

[regression so it kind of appears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m03s)
01:47:03

[everywhere in machine learning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m05s)
01:47:05

[you'll see that kind of a sigmoid and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m06s)
01:47:06

[softmax they're very close to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m08s)
01:47:08

[conceptually but this is what we want is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m12s)
01:47:12

[our activation function for multi-label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m15s)
01:47:15

[and this is what we want the single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m18s)
01:47:18

[label and again first AI does it all for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m19s)
01:47:19

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m22s)
01:47:22

[there was a question over here yes I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m22s)
01:47:22

[have a question about the initial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m31s)

[training that you do if I understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m34s)
01:47:34

[correctly you have we have frozen the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m35s)
01:47:35

[the premium model and you only need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m39s)
01:47:39

[initially try to train the latest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m42s)
01:47:42

[playwright right but from the other hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m46s)
01:47:46

[we said that only the initial layer so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m50s)
01:47:50

[let's last probably the first layer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m53s)
01:47:53

[like important to us and the other two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m55s)
01:47:55

[are more like features that are you must](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h47m58s)
01:47:58

[not related and we then apply in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m01s)
01:48:01

[case what that they the lie is a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m03s)
01:48:03

[important but the pre-trained weights in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m07s)
01:48:07

[them aren't so it's the later layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m10s)
01:48:10

[that we really want to train the most so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m13s)
01:48:13

[earlier layers likely to be like already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m16s)
01:48:16

[closer to what we want okay so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m20s)
01:48:20

[started with the latest one and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m23s)
01:48:23

[go right so if you go back to our quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m25s)
01:48:25

[dogs and cats right when we create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m27s)
01:48:27

[model from pre train from a pre train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m31s)
01:48:31

[model it returns something where all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m33s)
01:48:33

[the convolutional layers are frozen and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m36s)
01:48:36

[some randomly set fully connected layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m38s)
01:48:38

[we add to the end our unfrozen and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m42s)
01:48:42

[when we go fit at first it just trains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m46s)
01:48:46

[the randomly set a randomly initialized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m50s)
01:48:50

[fully connected letters right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m53s)
01:48:53

[and if something is like really close to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m56s)
01:48:56

[imagenet that's often all we need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h48m59s)
01:48:59

[but because the early early layers are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m02s)
01:49:02

[already good at finding edges gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m04s)
01:49:04

[repeating patterns for ears and dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m08s)
01:49:08

[heads you know so then when we unfreeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m11s)
01:49:11

[we set the learning rates for the early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m16s)
01:49:16

[layers to be really low because we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m19s)
01:49:19

[want to change the mesh for us the later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m22s)
01:49:22

[ones we set them to be higher where else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m25s)
01:49:25

[for satellite data right this is no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m28s)
01:49:28

[longer true you know the early layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m32s)
01:49:32

[are still like better than the later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m34s)
01:49:34

[layers but we still probably need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m37s)
01:49:37

[change them quite a bit so that's right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m40s)
01:49:40

[this learning rate is nine times smaller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m42s)
01:49:42

[than the final learning rate rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m45s)
01:49:45

[a thousand times smaller the final loan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m48s)
01:49:48

[rate okay you play with with the weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m52s)
01:49:52

[of the layers yeah normally most of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h49m55s)
01:49:55

[stuff you see online if they talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m00s)
01:50:00

[this at all they'll talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m01s)
01:50:01

[unfreezing different subsets of layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m03s)
01:50:03

[and indeed we do unfreeze our randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m07s)
01:50:07

[generated runs but what I found is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m10s)
01:50:10

[although the first layer library you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m13s)
01:50:13

[type learn dot freeze too and just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m16s)
01:50:16

[freeze a subset of layers this approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m18s)
01:50:18

[of using differential learning rates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m20s)
01:50:20

[seems to be like more flexible to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m22s)
01:50:22

[point that I never find myself I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m26s)
01:50:26

[freezing subsets of layers that I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m28s)
01:50:28

[expect you to start with that with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m32s)
01:50:32

[different cell the different learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m34s)
01:50:34

[rates rather than trying to learn the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m37s)
01:50:37

[last layer so the reason okay so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m40s)
01:50:40

[could skip this training just the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m43s)
01:50:43

[layers and just go straight to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m48s)
01:50:48

[differential learning rates but you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m49s)
01:50:49

[probably don't want to and the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m52s)
01:50:52

[you probably don't want to is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m53s)
01:50:53

[there's a difference the convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m55s)
01:50:55

[layers all contain pre-trained weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h50m57s)
01:50:57

[so they're like they're not random for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m00s)
01:51:00

[things that are close to imagenet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m03s)
01:51:03

[they're actually really good for things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m05s)
01:51:05

[that are not close to imagenet they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m07s)
01:51:07

[better than that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m09s)
01:51:09

[all of our fully connected layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m10s)
01:51:10

[however are totally random so therefore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m13s)
01:51:13

[you would always want to make the fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m17s)
01:51:17

[connected weights better than random by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m19s)
01:51:19

[training them a bit first because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m21s)
01:51:21

[otherwise if you go straight to unfreeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m24s)
01:51:24

[then you're actually going to be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m26s)
01:51:26

[fiddling around of those early early can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m28s)
01:51:28

[early layer weights when the later ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m31s)
01:51:31

[are still random that's probably not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m34s)
01:51:34

[what you want I think that's another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m35s)
01:51:35

[question here any possible so when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m37s)
01:51:37

[unfreeze what are the things we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m41s)
01:51:41

[trying to change there will it change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m46s)
01:51:46

[the Colonel's themselves that that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m50s)
01:51:50

[always what SGD does yeah so the only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m54s)
01:51:54

[thing what training means is setting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h51m57s)
01:51:57

[these numbers right and these numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m02s)
01:52:02

[and these numbers the weights so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m09s)
01:52:09

[weights are the weights of the fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m18s)
01:52:18

[connected layers and the weights in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m19s)
01:52:19

[those kernels and the convolutions so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m22s)
01:52:22

[that's what training means it's and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m24s)
01:52:24

[we'll learn about how to do it with SGD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m27s)
01:52:27

[but training literally is setting those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m29s)
01:52:29

[numbers these numbers on the other hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m32s)
01:52:32

[are activations they're calculated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m34s)
01:52:34

[they're calculated from the weights and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m38s)
01:52:38

[the previous layers activations or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m41s)
01:52:41

[amounts of questions so you can lift it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m44s)
01:52:44

[up higher and speak badly so in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m49s)
01:52:49

[example of a cheerleader set of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m51s)
01:52:51

[English example so you start with very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m52s)
01:52:52

[small size existed for yeah so does it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m55s)
01:52:55

[literally mean you know the model takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h52m58s)
01:52:58

[a small area from the entire image that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m00s)
01:53:00

[is 64 bytes so how do we get that 64 by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m03s)
01:53:03

[64 depends on the transforms by default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m08s)
01:53:08

[our transform takes the smallest edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m13s)
01:53:13

[and recites the whole thing out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m18s)
01:53:18

[samples it so the smallest edge is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m22s)
01:53:22

[societics t4 and then it takes a Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m24s)
01:53:24

[crop of that okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m27s)
01:53:27

[although when we're using data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m29s)
01:53:29

[augmentation it actually takes a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m33s)
01:53:33

[randomly chosen prop ie the case where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m35s)
01:53:35

[the image ties to multiple objects don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m40s)
01:53:40

[in this case like would it be possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m43s)
01:53:43

[that you would just lose the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m46s)
01:53:46

[things that they try to predict yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m48s)
01:53:48

[which is why data augmentation is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m50s)
01:53:50

[important so by by and particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m51s)
01:53:51

[their test time augmentation is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m54s)
01:53:54

[be particularly important because you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m57s)
01:53:57

[would you wouldn't want to you know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h53m59s)
01:53:59

[there may be a artisanal mine out in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m00s)
01:54:00

[corner which if you take a center crop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m03s)
01:54:03

[you you don't see so data augmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m06s)
01:54:06

[becomes very important yeah so when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m08s)
01:54:08

[talk on their tributaries are he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m15s)
01:54:15

[receiver up to that's not really what a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m17s)
01:54:17

[model choice Delton that's a great point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m21s)
01:54:21

[that's not the loss function yeah right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m23s)
01:54:23

[the loss function is something we'll be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m25s)
01:54:25

[learning about next week and it uses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m27s)
01:54:27

[cross entropy or otherwise known as like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m30s)
01:54:30

[negative log likelihood the metric is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m33s)
01:54:33

[just this thing that's printed so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m37s)
01:54:37

[see what's going on just next to that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m39s)
01:54:39

[in the context of my deep pass modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m43s)
01:54:43

[cannot change data does it trading it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m47s)
01:54:47

[also have to be multiplied so can I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m49s)
01:54:49

[train on just like images of pure cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m51s)
01:54:51

[and dogs and expect it at prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m53s)
01:54:53

[time to predict if I give it a picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m54s)
01:54:54

[of both having cat eye on it over I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h54m57s)
01:54:57

[never tried that and I've never seen an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m04s)
01:55:04

[example of something that needed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m06s)
01:55:06

[I guess conceptually there's no reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m08s)
01:55:08

[it wouldn't work but it's kind of out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m11s)
01:55:11

[there and you still use a sigmoid you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m14s)
01:55:14

[would have to make sure you're using a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m18s)
01:55:18

[sigmoid loss function so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m19s)
01:55:19

[faster eyes default would not work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m20s)
01:55:20

[because by default first day I would say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m22s)
01:55:22

[your training data knitter has both a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m24s)
01:55:24

[cat and the dog so you would have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m26s)
01:55:26

[override the loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m28s)
01:55:28

[when you use the differential learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m35s)
01:55:35

[rates those three learning rates do they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m37s)
01:55:37

[just kind of spread evenly across the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m40s)
01:55:40

[layers yeah we'll talk more about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m42s)
01:55:42

[later in the course but I mean the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m46s)
01:55:46

[faster I library there's a concept of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m48s)
01:55:48

[layer groups so in something like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m50s)
01:55:50

[resonant 50 you know there's hundreds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m53s)
01:55:53

[layers and I think it you don't want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m55s)
01:55:55

[write down hundreds of learning rates so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h55m57s)
01:55:57

[I've basically decided for you how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m00s)
01:56:00

[split them and the the last one always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m03s)
01:56:03

[refers just to the fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m07s)
01:56:07

[layers that we've randomly initialized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m10s)
01:56:10

[and edit to the end and then these ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m12s)
01:56:12

[are split generally about halfway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m14s)
01:56:14

[through basically I've tried to make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m16s)
01:56:16

[so that these you know these ones are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m19s)
01:56:19

[kind of the ones which you hardly want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m22s)
01:56:22

[to change at all and these are the ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m24s)
01:56:24

[you might want to change a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m25s)
01:56:25

[and I don't think we're covered in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m26s)
01:56:26

[course but if you're interested we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m29s)
01:56:29

[talk about in the forum there are ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m30s)
01:56:30

[you can override this behavior to define](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m31s)
01:56:31

[your own layer groups if you want to and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m33s)
01:56:33

[is there any way to visualize the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m36s)
01:56:36

[easily or like don't dump the layers of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m38s)
01:56:38

[the model yeah absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m41s)
01:56:41

[you can let's make sure we've got one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m43s)
01:56:43

[here okay so if you just type learn it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m47s)
01:56:47

[doesn't tell you much at all but what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m54s)
01:56:54

[you can do is go learn summary and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h56m55s)
01:56:55

[spits out basically everything there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m02s)
01:57:02

[all the letters and so you can see in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m07s)
01:57:07

[this case these are the names I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m09s)
01:57:09

[mentioned how they look up names right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m13s)
01:57:13

[so the first layer is called con 2 d 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m14s)
01:57:14

[and it's going to take as input this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m17s)
01:57:17

[useful to actually look at it's taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m21s)
01:57:21

[64 by 64 images which is what we told it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m24s)
01:57:24

[we're going to transform things to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m27s)
01:57:27

[is three channels high torch like most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m28s)
01:57:28

[things have channels at the end would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m33s)
01:57:33

[say 64 by 64 by 3 ply torch music to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m35s)
01:57:35

[front so it's 3 by 64 by 64 that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m38s)
01:57:38

[because it turns out that some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m41s)
01:57:41

[GPU computations run faster when it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m44s)
01:57:44

[in that order okay but that happens all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m46s)
01:57:46

[behind-the-scenes automatic plays a part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m49s)
01:57:49

[of that transformation stuff that's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m50s)
01:57:50

[of all done automatically is to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m53s)
01:57:53

[minus one means however however big the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h57m56s)
01:57:56

[batch size is in care us they use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m00s)
01:58:00

[number they use a special number none in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m04s)
01:58:04

[pile types that used minus one so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m07s)
01:58:07

[is a four dimensional mini batch the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m09s)
01:58:09

[number of elements in the amount of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m13s)
01:58:13

[images in the mini batch is dynamic you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m15s)
01:58:15

[can change that the number of channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m18s)
01:58:18

[is three number which is a 64 by 64 okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m20s)
01:58:20

[and so then you can basically see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m23s)
01:58:23

[this particular convolutional kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m26s)
01:58:26

[apparently has 64 kernels in it and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m29s)
01:58:29

[also having we haven't talked about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m32s)
01:58:32

[but convolutions can have something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m35s)
01:58:35

[called a stride that is like Matt pullin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m36s)
01:58:36

[it changes the size so it's returning a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m39s)
01:58:39

[32 by 32 564 kernel tenza and so on and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m41s)
01:58:41

[so forth so that's summary and we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m47s)
01:58:47

[learn all about that's doing in detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m51s)
01:58:51

[on in the second half of the course one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m54s)
01:58:54

[where I clicked in my own data set and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h58m57s)
01:58:57

[try to use the in as a really small data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m00s)
01:59:00

[set these currencies from Google Images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m02s)
01:59:02

[and I tried to do a learning rate find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m06s)
01:59:06

[and then the plot and it just it gave me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m09s)
01:59:09

[some numbers which I didn't understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m12s)
01:59:12

[and the learning rate font yeah and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m14s)
01:59:14

[the plot was empty so yeah I mean let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m15s)
01:59:15

[let's talk about that on the forum but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m18s)
01:59:18

[basically the learning rate finder is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m20s)
01:59:20

[going to go through a mini batch at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m22s)
01:59:22

[time if you've got a tiny data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m24s)
01:59:24

[there's just not enough mini batches so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m26s)
01:59:26

[the trick is to make your mini bit make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m28s)
01:59:28

[your batch size really small like try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m30s)
01:59:30

[making it like four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m32s)
01:59:32

[okay they were great questions it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m38s)
01:59:38

[nothing online to add you know they were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m40s)
01:59:40

[great questions we've got a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m44s)
01:59:44

[past where I hope to but let's let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m45s)
01:59:45

[quickly talk about structured data so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m48s)
01:59:48

[can start thinking about it for next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m51s)
01:59:51

[week so this is really weird right to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m52s)
01:59:52

[there's basically two types of data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=01h59m59s)
01:59:59

[we use in machine learning there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m02s)
02:00:02

[type of data like audio images natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m04s)
02:00:04

[language text where all of the all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m10s)
02:00:10

[the things inside an object like all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m14s)
02:00:14

[the pixels inside an image are all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m16s)
02:00:16

[same kind of thing they're all pixels or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m18s)
02:00:18

[they're all apertures of a waveform or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m21s)
02:00:21

[they're all words I call this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m26s)
02:00:26

[data unstructured and then there's data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m30s)
02:00:30

[sets like a profit and loss statement or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m33s)
02:00:33

[the information about a Facebook user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m37s)
02:00:37

[where each column is like structurally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m39s)
02:00:39

[quite different you know one thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m43s)
02:00:43

[representing like how many page views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m45s)
02:00:45

[last month another one is their sex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m47s)
02:00:47

[another one is what zip code they're in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m49s)
02:00:49

[and I call this structure there that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m51s)
02:00:51

[particular terminology is not unusual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m55s)
02:00:55

[like lots of people use that terminology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h00m57s)
02:00:57

[but lots of people don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m00s)
02:01:00

[there's no particularly agreed-upon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m02s)
02:01:02

[terminology so when I say structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m05s)
02:01:05

[data I'm referring to kind of columnar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m08s)
02:01:08

[data as you might find in a database or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m11s)
02:01:11

[a spreadsheet where different columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m14s)
02:01:14

[represent different kinds of things and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m16s)
02:01:16

[each row represents an observation and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m19s)
02:01:19

[so structured data is probably what most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m21s)
02:01:21

[of you are analyzing most of the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m25s)
02:01:25

[funnily enough you know academics in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m31s)
02:01:31

[deep learning world don't really give a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m34s)
02:01:34

[ about structured data because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m37s)
02:01:37

[pretty hard to get published in fancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m39s)
02:01:39

[conference proceedings if you're like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m41s)
02:01:41

[you've got a better logistics model you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m44s)

[know it's the thing that makes the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m46s)

[everybody you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m49s)

[and efficiency and make stuff work but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m51s)
02:01:51

[it's largely ignored sadly so we're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h01m55s)
02:01:55

[going to ignore it because we're a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m00s)

[real-world problems so there are some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m08s)
02:02:08

[great capable competitions we can look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m10s)
02:02:10

[at there's one running right now which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m11s)
02:02:11

[is the grocery sales forecasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m14s)

[about currently running competitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m26s)
02:02:26

[because I don't want to you know help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m28s)
02:02:28

[you cheat but it so happens there was a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m29s)
02:02:29

[competition a year or two ago for one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m32s)
02:02:32

[Germany's magistrate chains which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m35s)
02:02:35

[almost identical so I'm going to show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m38s)
02:02:38

[you how to do that so that was called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m40s)
02:02:40

[the Rossman stores data and so I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m45s)
02:02:45

[suggest you know first of all try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m50s)
02:02:50

[practicing what we're learning on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m52s)
02:02:52

[Russman right but then see if you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m53s)
02:02:53

[get it working on on grocery because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m56s)
02:02:56

[currently on the leaderboard no one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h02m58s)
02:02:58

[seems to basically know what they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m02s)
02:03:02

[doing in the groceries competition if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m03s)
02:03:03

[you look at the leaderboard the let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m05s)
02:03:05

[see here yeah these ones around 5 to 9 v](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m10s)
02:03:10

[3o are people that are literally finding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m13s)
02:03:13

[like group averages and submitting those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m15s)
02:03:15

[I know because they're kernels that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m18s)
02:03:18

[they're using so you know the basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m19s)
02:03:19

[the people around 20th place are not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m22s)
02:03:22

[actually doing any machine learning so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m24s)
02:03:24

[yeah let's see if we can improve things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m29s)
02:03:29

[so you'll see there's a less than 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m31s)
02:03:31

[rossmann notebook sure you get pull ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m34s)
02:03:34

[in fact you know just reminder you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m38s)
02:03:38

[before you start working get pull in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m40s)
02:03:40

[you're faster a repo and from time to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m42s)
02:03:42

[time Condor and update for you guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m45s)
02:03:45

[during the in-person course the Condor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m48s)
02:03:48

[and update you should do it more often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m51s)
02:03:51

[because we're kind of changing things a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m52s)
02:03:52

[little bit um folks in the MOOC you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m55s)
02:03:55

[more like once a month should be fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h03m57s)
02:03:57

[so anyway I just just changed this a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m01s)
02:04:01

[little bit so make sure you get Paul to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m04s)
02:04:04

[get lesson 3 Rossman and there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m05s)
02:04:05

[couple of new libraries here one is fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m09s)
02:04:09

[AI dot structure faster guided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m11s)
02:04:11

[structured contain stuff which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m14s)
02:04:14

[actually not at all high torch specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m16s)
02:04:16

[and we actually use that in the machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m18s)
02:04:18

[learning course as well for doing random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m20s)

[forests with no tie torch at all I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m23s)

[particular library without any of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m27s)
02:04:27

[other parts of fast AI so that can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m30s)
02:04:30

[handy and then we're also going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m33s)
02:04:33

[faster column data which is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m36s)
02:04:36

[some stuff that allows us to do fast a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h04m39s)

[okay and so I'm kind of going to assume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m42s)
02:05:42

[that you know your way around these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h05m45s)

[goes to file start faster day.i because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m15s)
02:06:15

[this doesn't require any login or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m17s)
02:06:17

[anything to grab this data set it's as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m19s)
02:06:19

[it and just type W get and the URL okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m26s)
02:06:26

[so that's because you know it's it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m36s)

[grab the grab it from there and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m44s)

[always read a CSV file with just pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m47s)
02:06:47

[don't read CSV now in this particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m49s)
02:06:49

[case there's a lot of pre-processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m52s)
02:06:52

[that we do and what I've actually done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m55s)
02:06:55

[here is I've I've actually stolen the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h06m57s)

[winner roster okay so they made all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m06s)
02:07:06

[their data they're really great you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m08s)
02:07:08

[they better get hub available with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m11s)
02:07:11

[everything that we need and I've ported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m12s)
02:07:12

[it all across and simplified it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m14s)
02:07:14

[tried to make it pretty easy to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m16s)
02:07:16

[understand this course is about deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m18s)
02:07:18

[learning not about data processing so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m23s)
02:07:23

[I'm not going to go through it but we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m25s)
02:07:25

[will be going through it in the machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m28s)
02:07:28

[learning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m29s)
02:07:29

[in some detail because feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m30s)
02:07:30

[engineering is really important so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m32s)
02:07:32

[you're interested you know check out the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m34s)
02:07:34

[machine learning course for that I will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m37s)
02:07:37

[however show you kind of what it looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m41s)
02:07:41

[like so once we read the CSV Xin you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m44s)
02:07:44

[see basically what's there so the key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m48s)
02:07:48

[one is for a particular store we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h07m50s)
02:07:50

[the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m01s)
02:08:01

[we have the date and we have the sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m05s)
02:08:05

[for that particular store we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m09s)
02:08:09

[whether that thing is on promo or not we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m12s)
02:08:12

[know the number of customers at that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m18s)
02:08:18

[particular store had we know whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m19s)
02:08:19

[that date was a school holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m23s)
02:08:23

[we also know what kind of store it is so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m29s)
02:08:29

[this is pretty common right you'll often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m36s)
02:08:36

[get datasets where there's some column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m38s)
02:08:38

[with like just some kind of code we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m41s)
02:08:41

[don't really know what the code means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m43s)
02:08:43

[and most of the time I find it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m44s)
02:08:44

[matter what it means like normally you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m47s)
02:08:47

[get given a data dictionary when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m49s)
02:08:49

[start on a project and obviously if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m51s)
02:08:51

[you're working on an internal project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m53s)
02:08:53

[you can ask the people at your company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m54s)
02:08:54

[what does this column mean I kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m56s)
02:08:56

[stay away from learning too much about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h08m59s)
02:08:59

[it I prefer to like to see what the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m01s)
02:09:01

[says first there's something about what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m03s)
02:09:03

[kind of product are we selling in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m08s)
02:09:08

[particular row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m10s)
02:09:10

[and then there's information about like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m13s)
02:09:13

[how far away is the nearest competitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m16s)
02:09:16

[how long have they been open for how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m19s)
02:09:19

[long is the promo being on for for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m24s)
02:09:24

[store we can find out what state it's in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m31s)
02:09:31

[for each state we can find at the name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m32s)
02:09:32

[of the state this is in Germany and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m35s)
02:09:35

[interestingly they were allowed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m38s)
02:09:38

[download any data external data they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m40s)
02:09:40

[wanted in this competition just very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m42s)
02:09:42

[common as long as you share it with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m44s)
02:09:44

[everybody else and so some folks tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m46s)
02:09:46

[downloading data from Google Trends I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m48s)
02:09:48

[not sure exactly what it was that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m53s)
02:09:53

[would check in the trend off but we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m55s)
02:09:55

[this information from Google Trends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m56s)
02:09:56

[somebody downloaded the weather for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h09m59s)
02:09:59

[every day in Germany every state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m01s)
02:10:01

[and yeah that's about it right so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m09s)
02:10:09

[can get a data frame summary with pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m17s)
02:10:17

[which kind of lets you see how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m20s)
02:10:20

[observations and means and standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m22s)
02:10:22

[deviations again I don't do a hell of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m24s)
02:10:24

[lot with that early on but it's nice to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m27s)
02:10:27

[note there so what we do you know this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m30s)
02:10:30

[is called a relational data set a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m34s)
02:10:34

[relational data set is one where there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m35s)
02:10:35

[quite a few tables we have to join](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m37s)
02:10:37

[together it's very easy to do that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m38s)
02:10:38

[pandas there's a thing called merge so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m41s)
02:10:41

[great little function to do that and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m43s)
02:10:43

[I just started joining everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m45s)
02:10:45

[together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m46s)
02:10:46

[joining the weather or the Google Trends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m46s)
02:10:46

[stores yeah that's about everything I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m49s)
02:10:49

[guess you'll see there's one thing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m57s)
02:10:57

[I'm using from the FASTA a library which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h10m59s)
02:10:59

[is called add date part we talked about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m02s)
02:11:02

[this a lot in the machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m04s)
02:11:04

[course but basically this is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m06s)
02:11:06

[take a date and pull out of a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m07s)
02:11:07

[columns day of week is at the start of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m10s)
02:11:10

[quarter month of year so on and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m12s)
02:11:12

[and add them all in to the dataset okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m16s)
02:11:16

[so this is all standard pre-processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m18s)
02:11:18

[all right so we join everything together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m22s)
02:11:22

[we fiddle around with some of the dates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m24s)
02:11:24

[a little bit some of them are in month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m26s)
02:11:26

[in year format we turn it into date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m28s)
02:11:28

[format we spend a lot of time trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m29s)
02:11:29

[take information about for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m35s)
02:11:35

[holidays and add a column for like how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m37s)
02:11:37

[long until the next holiday how long has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m40s)
02:11:40

[it been since the last holiday ditto for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m42s)
02:11:42

[promos so on and so forth okay so we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m45s)
02:11:45

[all that and at the very end we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m49s)
02:11:49

[basically save a big structured data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m52s)
02:11:52

[file that contains all that stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m54s)
02:11:54

[something that those of you that use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m57s)
02:11:57

[pandas may not be aware of is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h11m59s)
02:11:59

[there's a very cool new format called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m01s)
02:12:01

[feather which you can save a panda's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m03s)
02:12:03

[data frame into this feather format it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m05s)
02:12:05

[kind of pretty much takes it as it sits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m08s)
02:12:08

[in RAM and dumps it to the disk and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m11s)
02:12:11

[it's like really really really fast the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m13s)
02:12:13

[reason that you need to know this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m16s)
02:12:16

[because the ecuadorian grocery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m18s)
02:12:18

[competition is on now has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m20s)
02:12:20

[350 million records so you will care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m22s)
02:12:22

[about how long things take a talk I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m26s)
02:12:26

[believe about six seconds for me to save](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m28s)
02:12:28

[three hundred and fifty million records](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m30s)
02:12:30

[to feather format so that's pretty cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m32s)
02:12:32

[so at the end of all that I'd save it as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m35s)
02:12:35

[a feather format and for the rest of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m37s)
02:12:37

[this discussion I'm just going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m39s)

[it as given that we've got this nicely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m40s)

[have to run those previous cells oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m50s)
02:12:50

[except the see these ones have commented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m53s)
02:12:53

[out you don't have to run those because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m57s)
02:12:57

[the file that you download from files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h12m59s)
02:12:59

[doc bastard AI has already done that for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m01s)
02:13:01

[you okay all right so we basically have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m03s)
02:13:03

[all these columns so it basically is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m09s)
02:13:09

[going to tell us you know how many of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m14s)
02:13:14

[this thing was sold on this date at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m18s)
02:13:18

[store and so the goal of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m23s)
02:13:23

[competition is to find out how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m25s)
02:13:25

[things will be sold for each store for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m28s)
02:13:28

[each type of thing in the future okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m32s)
02:13:32

[and so that's basically what we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m36s)
02:13:36

[to be trying to do and so here's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m38s)
02:13:38

[example of what some of the data looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m40s)
02:13:40

[like and so next week we're going to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m42s)
02:13:42

[how to go through these steps but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m48s)
02:13:48

[basically what we're going to learn is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m50s)
02:13:50

[we're going to learn to split the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m52s)
02:13:52

[columns into two types some columns were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m55s)
02:13:55

[going to treat as categorical which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h13m58s)
02:13:58

[to say store ID one and store ID - I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m01s)
02:14:01

[not numerically related to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m06s)
02:14:06

[they're categories right we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m08s)
02:14:08

[treat day of week like that - Monday and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m11s)
02:14:11

[Tuesday day zero and day one not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m13s)
02:14:13

[numerically related to each other where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m15s)
02:14:15

[else distance in kilometers to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m17s)
02:14:17

[nearest competitor that's a number that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m20s)
02:14:20

[we're going to treat numerically right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m24s)
02:14:24

[so in other words the categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m26s)
02:14:26

[variables we basically are going to one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m28s)
02:14:28

[how to encode them you can think of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m29s)
02:14:29

[as one hot encoding on where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m32s)
02:14:32

[the continuous variables we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m34s)
02:14:34

[be feeding into fully connected layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m35s)
02:14:35

[just as is okay so what we'll be doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m38s)
02:14:38

[is we'll be basically creating a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m43s)
02:14:43

[validation set and you'll see like a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m47s)
02:14:47

[of these are start to look familiar this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m49s)
02:14:49

[is the same function we used on planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m51s)
02:14:51

[and dog breeds to create a validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m53s)
02:14:53

[set there's some stuff that you haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m54s)
02:14:54

[seen before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m58s)
02:14:58

[where we're going to basically rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h14m59s)
02:14:59

[than saying image data dot from CSV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m02s)
02:15:02

[we're going to say columnar data from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m06s)
02:15:06

[data frame right so you can see like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m09s)
02:15:09

[basic API concepts will be the same but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m11s)
02:15:11

[they're a little different right but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m13s)
02:15:13

[just like before we're going to get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m17s)
02:15:17

[learner and we're going to go lr find to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m18s)
02:15:18

[find our best learning rate and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m23s)
02:15:23

[we're going to go dot fit with a metric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m26s)
02:15:26

[with a cycle length okay so the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m28s)
02:15:28

[sequence who's going to end up looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m33s)
02:15:33

[hopefully very familiar okay so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m35s)
02:15:35

[out of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m39s)
02:15:39

[so what I suggest you do this week is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m40s)
02:15:40

[like try to enter as many capital image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m42s)
02:15:42

[competitions as possible like like try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m47s)
02:15:47

[to really get this feel for like cycling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m49s)
02:15:49

[learning rates plotting things you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m53s)
02:15:53

[that that post I showed you at the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h15m59s)
02:15:59

[of class today that kind of took you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m03s)
02:16:03

[through lesson one like really go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m05s)
02:16:05

[through that on as many image datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m08s)
02:16:08

[as you can you just feel really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m11s)
02:16:11

[comfortable with it right because you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m13s)
02:16:13

[want to get to the point where next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m17s)
02:16:17

[when we start talking about structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m18s)
02:16:18

[data that this idea of like how learners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m19s)
02:16:19

[kind of work and data works and data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m22s)
02:16:22

[loaders and data sets and looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m24s)
02:16:24

[pictures should be really you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m26s)
02:16:26

[intuitive all right good luck see you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C06ZPF8Uuc#t=02h16m28s)
