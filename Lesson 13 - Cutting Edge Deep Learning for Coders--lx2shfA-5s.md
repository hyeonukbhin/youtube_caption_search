00:01:51

[were well published and incredibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h01m54s)
00:01:54

[accomplished so also undergraduate here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h01m58s)

[college and my background was that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m03s)
00:02:03

[have seen an industry I join and on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m06s)
00:02:06

[consulting so I didn't on equality in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m09s)
00:02:09

[statistics and now I working with data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[scientists so how long have you been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m13s)
00:02:13

[coding for so I've been coding to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m15s)
00:02:15

[well what makes me page yeah yeah Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m18s)

[told me you had a you had a same moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m24s)
00:02:24

[when the in Goodfellow interview - is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m27s)
00:02:27

[that true thing about the whole process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m29s)
00:02:29

[is that you're so nervous the whole time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m39s)
00:02:39

[I'm so excited but also you're talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m41s)
00:02:41

[to these people whose research you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m45s)
00:02:45

[followed for yeah and that's how you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[would just my my my Google hangout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m49s)
00:02:49

[script hanger interview is actually when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m53s)
00:02:53

[you go there shell and start learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m55s)
00:02:55

[about neural nets watching has moved so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m57s)
00:02:57

[it's just it feels so real and I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h02m59s)
00:02:59

[that's quite of intent of the program is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m02s)
00:03:02

[to take very very different people at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m04s)
00:03:04

[different prices and create so you told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m09s)
00:03:09

[me that before the start of this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m12s)
00:03:12

[your awareness of neural nets was a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m15s)
00:03:15

[little bit of theory from a few blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[posts I mean so how much is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m20s)
00:03:20

[through this course kind of helped you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m24s)
00:03:24

[get the skills you needed to get into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[this program I wasn't coding in winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m29s)
00:03:29

[for MIDI 9 picture before this board I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m34s)
00:03:34

[done I done to be family guy and I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m37s)
00:03:37

[fascinated by it be planning for what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m41s)
00:03:41

[did if I was pretty deep in the theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m43s)
00:03:43

[but I think part of why it was blog post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m46s)
00:03:46

[with business it wasn't a coherent body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m49s)
00:03:49

[of work and so now some other bands book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m51s)
00:03:51

[that is an spec which I have read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m56s)
00:03:56

[is really a fantastic treatment and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h03m59s)
00:03:59

[think that what this course offers and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m01s)
00:04:01

[said like many of you may have had the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m03s)
00:04:03

[same experience is the implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m05s)
00:04:05

[which was very new to me and and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m08s)
00:04:08

[definitely something I don't think it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m10s)
00:04:10

[would have found in a different forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m14s)
00:04:14

[yeah I mean I know from talking to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m15s)
00:04:15

[Rachel that some of the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m17s)
00:04:17

[process was like actually sounded the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m19s)
00:04:19

[critic question Santa letter came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m22s)
00:04:22

[straight out of the course it was like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m23s)
00:04:23

[about how to do transfer learning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m24s)
00:04:24

[like all these kind of practical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[application stuff it seemed like at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m29s)
00:04:29

[least in my case it was a fairly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m32s)
00:04:32

[consistent breakdown throughout the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m35s)
00:04:35

[process of very math questions and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m37s)
00:04:37

[a project experience and with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m42s)
00:04:42

[project they're really trying to gauge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m44s)
00:04:44

[implementation and do a knowledge of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m46s)
00:04:46

[basically concepts that we've covered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m50s)
00:04:50

[very thoroughly in this class over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m53s)
00:04:53

[fetty's that was pretty distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h04m56s)
00:04:56

[understanding like how to address these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m00s)
00:05:00

[distribution differences so that's why I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m04s)
00:05:04

[think that that was standard throughout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m07s)
00:05:07

[the whole process with the big spectrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m11s)
00:05:11

[YouTube and they expect the attendees to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m14s)
00:05:14

[have this holistic approach of both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m19s)
00:05:19

[coding but also a strong foundation and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m22s)
00:05:22

[opinions so if I could give a pitch for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m25s)
00:05:25

[your program one of the amazing things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m29s)

[science for social impact projects is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m40s)
00:05:40

[there room for people who might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m44s)
00:05:44

[interested to contact you if they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m46s)

[interested in doing that kind of work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m48s)
00:05:48

[and for me I wrote it honestly and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m50s)
00:05:50

[think that the the cows of this course I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m53s)
00:05:53

[would be so thrilled to work with anyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h05m56s)
00:05:56

[from this course going towards the like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m00s)
00:06:00

[the way that works I'll just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m02s)
00:06:02

[we pair with nonprofits all over the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m04s)
00:06:04

[world and you work with engineers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m07s)

[and and right now we like both with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m11s)

[eight different process and then we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m16s)

[try a new cycle to it then associate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m17s)

[up the challenge I set up two weeks ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m44s)
00:06:44

[in implementing cyclic all learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m46s)

[faster training of neural nets and also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m53s)
00:06:53

[more automated and Brad actually had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h06m57s)
00:06:57

[code of up super quickly and so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m00s)
00:07:00

[if you jump on the forum you'll find a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m04s)
00:07:04

[link to it there maybe Brad you can edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m06s)
00:07:06

[or Elle's wiki thread do we have a wiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m07s)

[this as I mentioned when we first taught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m19s)
00:07:19

[this this paper has been so little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m21s)

[looked at we don't yet really know like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m23s)
00:07:23

[I have a feeling it's going to turn out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m26s)
00:07:26

[that like this is the best way to train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m28s)
00:07:28

[like every kind of neural net in every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m30s)

[kind of situation so I've asked bread to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m32s)
00:07:32

[try as many possible experiments here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m35s)
00:07:35

[and you can clone keep water mating it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m38s)
00:07:38

[this is exactly the kind of thing like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m40s)
00:07:40

[Rachel and I at far say is going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m42s)
00:07:42

[if this really works out is like get rid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m44s)
00:07:44

[of the whole question of how to set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m47s)
00:07:47

[learning rates you know which currently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m49s)
00:07:49

[is such a personal thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m51s)
00:07:51

[so yes so congratulations Brad on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m56s)
00:07:56

[getting that working and it worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h07m58s)
00:07:58

[really well in care as I think you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m01s)
00:08:01

[with the callbacks they had a code in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m02s)
00:08:02

[that they were quite neat as well yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m05s)
00:08:05

[you got those air please add the current](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m10s)
00:08:10

[luster but I'm you're so excited about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[this callbacks and Karis because you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m15s)
00:08:15

[would like our set call backs to stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m16s)
00:08:16

[training if it's like you should stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[improving and then you can enter another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m24s)
00:08:24

[cycle to do different things and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[kind of oscillate between these like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[different ways yeah the callbacks and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m31s)
00:08:31

[fully automate this whole process so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m32s)
00:08:32

[kind of implemented similar leg zigzag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m34s)
00:08:34

[ins in this room so this case is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m36s)
00:08:36

[cool like it's like ten lines of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m39s)
00:08:39

[hoop breathing so far was this cold yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m41s)
00:08:41

[yeah absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m45s)
00:08:45

[and so remember you know that Kara has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m46s)
00:08:46

[great source code right so if you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m55s)
00:08:55

[in your anaconda live person packages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h08m58s)
00:08:58

[chaos directory you'll find all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m01s)
00:09:01

[current callbacks so when I said to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m03s)
00:09:03

[know pay for ads and chips is to how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m05s)
00:09:05

[get started I see if you don't go here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m07s)
00:09:07

[look at the existing callbacks and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m08s)
00:09:08

[if that helps you get it started you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[know anytime you want to build something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m13s)
00:09:13

[in Kara one of the best ways to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m14s)
00:09:14

[started is to read the source code for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m16s)
00:09:16

[something that it already has somewhat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m18s)
00:09:18

[similar to watching earlier and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m20s)
00:09:20

[certainly with callbacks it's an easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m23s)
00:09:23

[way to do that it's been a big week in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m24s)
00:09:24

[deep learning as usual everything I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[taught you in this course is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m29s)
00:09:29

[officially out of date hopefully so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m31s)
00:09:31

[are the things I have noticed is it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m35s)
00:09:35

[all building on stuff that we've been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m36s)
00:09:36

[learning around about perhaps it began](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[to Brad for I'm drawing my attention to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m41s)
00:09:41

[this paper which is the new style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m43s)
00:09:43

[transfer paper which can transfer to any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[style in real time so you don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[build a separate Network for each one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[this is the kind of thing which you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m55s)
00:09:55

[could absolutely turn into an app and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m57s)
00:09:57

[obviously no one's done it yet because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h09m59s)
00:09:59

[paper just came out so you could be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[first one to say you know here's a path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m02s)
00:10:02

[which can create any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m05s)
00:10:05

[photo into any style you like and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m07s)
00:10:07

[honestly I think this third column is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m09s)
00:10:09

[their the new paper in my opinion if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m12s)
00:10:12

[compare it to kind of the gold standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m15s)
00:10:15

[which is the guidance paper we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m16s)
00:10:16

[originally looked at I actually think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m18s)
00:10:18

[it's maybe better you know like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m19s)
00:10:19

[looked more styling better this one so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m23s)
00:10:23

[there's an interesting paper one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m28s)
00:10:28

[basic ideas are the same but your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m31s)
00:10:31

[excellency has got some interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m33s)
00:10:33

[approaches Dan's have had a big step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m34s)
00:10:34

[forward these this is the previous state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m37s)
00:10:37

[of the art and face generation this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m40s)
00:10:40

[new as you can see these are now pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m43s)
00:10:43

[much at photorealistic at least at one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m46s)
00:10:46

[from yet I 128 these are only 64 by 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m48s)
00:10:48

[the August area so this is a pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[exciting step forward in in games and as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m55s)
00:10:55

[we've talked about people use scans at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h10m57s)
00:10:57

[the moment to create textures but they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m00s)
00:11:00

[can be used as a kind of additional loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m04s)
00:11:04

[function for any kind of generative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m06s)
00:11:06

[Network and so I think one of the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m08s)
00:11:08

[I always look for is what's under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m11s)
00:11:11

[pressure what's underappreciated what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m12s)
00:11:12

[not they used much at the moment and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m14s)
00:11:14

[would say stands for a wider range of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m16s)
00:11:16

[generative models you know if you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m19s)
00:11:19

[to create a really great super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m22s)

[resolution thing or if you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m25s)
00:11:25

[create a really great automatic create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m27s)

[line-drawing creator or you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m29s)
00:11:29

[colorization system or whatever any can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[and your approach I'm Brett the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m35s)
00:11:35

[amazing one is this paper you can relate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m39s)
00:11:39

[on to wiki which does a bi-directional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m42s)
00:11:42

[transfer even without matching pairs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m45s)
00:11:45

[so for example clearly this would not be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m49s)
00:11:49

[possible to do if you require matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m51s)
00:11:51

[pairs take a money and turn it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m53s)
00:11:53

[photo okay we don't have any data on how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m55s)
00:11:55

[to do that because we don't have any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m58s)
00:11:58

[photos of mine but as you can see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h11m59s)
00:11:59

00:12:10

[creating photorealistic images or very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m12s)
00:12:12

[impressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m15s)
00:12:15

[at work I think this approach to sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m17s)
00:12:17

[transfer by putting again layer that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m20s)
00:12:20

[more interesting than the file transfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m22s)
00:12:22

[we cannot so far because it really has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m24s)
00:12:24

[to create a painting that Class B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m25s)
00:12:25

[recognize is not the in real painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m30s)
00:12:30

[otherwise the can will fail so I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[this is a really interesting approach to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m35s)
00:12:35

[social transfer as well okay so really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m36s)
00:12:36

[interesting week these are all papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m42s)
00:12:42

[which I think any of you guys can can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m44s)
00:12:44

[tackle right now because they're all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m46s)
00:12:46

[built on the things we've learnt to its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m47s)

[cost if anybody's interested in tackling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m49s)

[any of them this week that'd be super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m51s)

[fun to talk about it from the forum yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m53s)
00:12:53

[just to clarify is this large paper also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h12m56s)

[somebody can find find out because I I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h13m16s)

[and put it on the wiki so I talked in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h13m22s)

[so we will talk about it more next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h13m51s)
00:13:51

[in terms of applications but the main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h13m53s)
00:13:53

[application we've talked about so far is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h13m55s)
00:13:55

[using it for the kind of faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h13m57s)
00:13:57

[pre-processing of really large data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m01s)
00:14:01

[items like CT scans in order to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m03s)
00:14:03

[objects of interest in this case loan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m06s)
00:14:06

[modules among cancers and one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m08s)
00:14:08

[things I mentioned that I was interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m12s)
00:14:12

[in was experimenting with combining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m13s)
00:14:13

[approxima sneer approximate nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m17s)
00:14:17

[natives with with mean shift clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m19s)
00:14:19

[and so to remind you the basic idea was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m23s)
00:14:23

[that here's our TTU version we went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m25s)
00:14:25

[through each mini batch and with each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m32s)
00:14:32

[mini batch we then basically data a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m34s)
00:14:34

[distance from every element in that mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m38s)
00:14:38

[batch to every single data item and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[we took the weighted sum of all the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m44s)
00:14:44

[items weighted by the webadvisor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m45s)
00:14:45

[Gaussian on those weights and I pointed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[out that most the vast majority of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m52s)
00:14:52

[points are far enough away that they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m54s)
00:14:54

[wasted so close to zero that we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m57s)
00:14:57

[probably ignore them so maybe we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h14m58s)
00:14:58

[have tried putting a approximate nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m00s)
00:15:00

[neighbor step beforehand so rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m03s)
00:15:03

[adding up the entire data set which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m06s)
00:15:06

[could be a million points we could just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[be the nearest hundred divas so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m10s)
00:15:10

[actually tried that during the week this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m12s)
00:15:12

[is basically what happened in Pugh so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m17s)
00:15:17

[this is a profit there's I just use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m19s)
00:15:19

[existing scikit-learn dot natives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[algorithm so I haven't written my own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m25s)
00:15:25

[it--which version and I know one of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m27s)
00:15:27

[guys on the forum has already started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m29s)
00:15:29

[writing applied for traditional so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m31s)
00:15:31

[just try to a bowl tree which is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m33s)
00:15:33

[particular kind of approximate nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m36s)
00:15:36

[neighbors and the basic idea is you say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m38s)
00:15:38

[okay here's the data that I want you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m40s)
00:15:40

[index so that I can rapidly do nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m42s)
00:15:42

[neighbors so now please do a query](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[looking at I don't know the first 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m48s)
00:15:48

[data points and for each one of those 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m50s)
00:15:50

[data points jimmies are 3 nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m52s)
00:15:52

[neighbors and that return something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m53s)
00:15:53

[this right here are the 10 data points I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m55s)
00:15:55

[passed in and here are their 3 across](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m57s)
00:15:57

[the nearest neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h15m59s)
00:15:59

[and of course all the time itself is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[phone nearest neighbor so that's why the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m04s)
00:16:04

[first one is is kind of boring so then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m06s)
00:16:06

[thought okay that looks good so then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[just put that into the loop of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m12s)
00:16:12

[mainship clustering so I said okay each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m15s)
00:16:15

[time we go through another epoch Index](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m16s)
00:16:16

[the data we have so far we've checked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m20s)
00:16:20

[into a really small trees and then when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m22s)
00:16:22

[we do our distances don't do them to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m26s)
00:16:26

[every point but instead stories into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m31s)
00:16:31

[nearest point so I did this did a query](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m34s)
00:16:34

[here to find the 50 nearest neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m36s)
00:16:36

[this then puts that into GPU I'm turning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m39s)
00:16:39

[it into a senator and tutoring us so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m44s)
00:16:44

[that gives me the list of the indexes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m48s)
00:16:48

[not the data itself so but interestingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m51s)
00:16:51

[the hardest step was the one that seems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m54s)
00:16:54

[like it should be the easiest which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m56s)
00:16:56

[that I have to then look up each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h16m58s)
00:16:58

[these indexes into the data to return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m00s)
00:17:00

[the actual points right now easy enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m02s)
00:17:02

[to do if you just look through it one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m05s)
00:17:05

[step at a time but we're trying to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m07s)
00:17:07

[the GPU right if I tried doing a one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m09s)
00:17:09

[step at a time it made the thing take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m11s)
00:17:11

[better because GPUs are not quick at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m13s)
00:17:13

[doing things at a time so I created a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m16s)
00:17:16

[little batch wise indexing function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m18s)
00:17:18

[which is the end ret Rachel and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m21s)
00:17:21

[realized we could do actually with very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m22s)
00:17:22

[very little code and this is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m24s)
00:17:24

[something where we could pass in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m26s)
00:17:26

[array and plastic limit our kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m28s)
00:17:28

[matrix of indexes and it would return a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m31s)
00:17:31

[three dimensional tensor basically as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m34s)
00:17:34

[every one of the points for every one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m36s)
00:17:36

[those nearest neighbors formula finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m38s)
00:17:38

[so that was the only bit that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m40s)
00:17:40

[remotely tricky other than that that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m42s)
00:17:42

[this function other than that the rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m45s)
00:17:45

[of the code is the same so this works in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m47s)
00:17:47

[the sense that have sped things up but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m50s)
00:17:50

[it didn't work in a sense of the result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m53s)
00:17:53

[here was the input we gave it and here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h17m55s)
00:17:55

[the output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m02s)
00:18:02

[what happened is it turns out each one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m04s)
00:18:04

[of these little colored dots actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m06s)
00:18:06

[now represent 50 coins so what it's done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m09s)
00:18:09

[is it's taking me to literally right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[it's basically found the 50 nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m15s)
00:18:15

[neighbors to each point and created a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m16s)
00:18:16

[cluster of 50 points and once it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m20s)
00:18:20

[created these clusters of 50 points it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m22s)
00:18:22

[nailed that right there's no way for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m24s)
00:18:24

[to cluster these any further because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m26s)
00:18:26

[every time it now goes nearest neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m28s)
00:18:28

[there's other tipping points to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m30s)
00:18:30

[right on top of you so an engine is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[basically show the kinds of things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m34s)
00:18:34

[can can go wrong hopefully by next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m36s)
00:18:36

[this will be six you know it's like when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m38s)
00:18:38

[I described this problem this thing like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m44s)
00:18:44

[that was clearly going to work and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m46s)
00:18:46

[as soon as I saw this picture I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m48s)
00:18:48

[immediately saw that it couldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m49s)
00:18:49

[possibly work you know so this is kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m51s)
00:18:51

[of the nature of trying things out but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m54s)
00:18:54

[the interesting thing is I now realize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m56s)
00:18:56

[that the solution to this will be way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h18m57s)
00:18:57

[faster than this right the solution is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m00s)
00:19:00

[what Rachel describes as an approximate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m02s)
00:19:02

[approximate nearest neighbors right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m05s)
00:19:05

[which is something that doesn't return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m07s)
00:19:07

[the 50 probably nearest point returns 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m09s)
00:19:09

[points which probabilistically close to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m13s)
00:19:13

[ones are more likely to be there but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m18s)
00:19:18

[there are like zero guarantees like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m20s)
00:19:20

[want it to be less good so you know if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m22s)
00:19:22

[you're interested during the week if one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m26s)
00:19:26

[of you want to try creating a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m27s)
00:19:27

[approximate approximate nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m28s)
00:19:28

[neighbors algorithm I think it will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m30s)
00:19:30

[basically be a case of taking like LSH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m32s)
00:19:32

[or whole tree or something and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m35s)
00:19:35

[removing a lot of the code you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[removing the code that makes it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m38s)
00:19:38

[so hopefully you know next week we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m42s)
00:19:42

[see this working but I thought it'd be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m46s)
00:19:46

[interesting to see that you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[intermediate stage and actually this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m50s)
00:19:50

[kind of thing is like showing you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m54s)
00:19:54

[failures like you don't get to see most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m56s)
00:19:56

[of the failures so I was working with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h19m58s)
00:19:58

[some of the students over the weekend on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m00s)
00:20:00

[implementing some finger will see later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m02s)
00:20:02

[on today and actually on Saturday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[afternoon I was sitting with Melissa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m07s)
00:20:07

[going through some of this coding and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m09s)
00:20:09

[Atlantis bit and look to look like oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m11s)
00:20:11

[wow it's really interesting to see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m13s)
00:20:13

[process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m15s)
00:20:15

[because it's like becoming on Monday the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m16s)
00:20:16

[thought that's working where else we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m18s)
00:20:18

[spent the entire Saturday afternoon like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[slowly going through one at a time and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[completely making mistakes do you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m25s)
00:20:25

[any better to sort of see what happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m27s)
00:20:27

[so yeah the actual process is everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m29s)
00:20:29

[you see in class getting it working is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m34s)
00:20:34

[full of failures and in fact Brad is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m35s)
00:20:35

[currently working on building one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m40s)
00:20:40

[two things we're doing it the next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m42s)
00:20:42

[I need to turn a key before class it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m43s)
00:20:43

[like yeah finish reading and nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m45s)
00:20:45

[worked at all you know looks like yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m48s)
00:20:48

[of course nothing ever worked so tiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m50s)
00:20:50

[and so part of the process is you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m52s)
00:20:52

[something I've been trying to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m55s)
00:20:55

[talk to Brad about with you know his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m56s)
00:20:56

[work is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h20m59s)
00:20:59

[recognizing that every time you build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m01s)
00:21:01

[something new it won't work means that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m03s)
00:21:03

[you need to build it in a very different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m05s)
00:21:05

[way right like right and I apply for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m07s)
00:21:07

[notebook as if you're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m10s)
00:21:10

[teaching at next Sunday's class right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m12s)
00:21:12

[because the closet won't work the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m14s)
00:21:14

[time you're going to have to go back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m15s)
00:21:15

[if you like which one of these steps a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m17s)
00:21:17

[great so at every step you want to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m19s)
00:21:19

[printing out a result summarizing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m22s)
00:21:22

[best you know the keys kisstixx drawing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m24s)
00:21:24

[pictures writing down the reasoning that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m27s)
00:21:27

[you did things you know so that then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m29s)
00:21:29

[when it doesn't work you could go back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m31s)
00:21:31

[and be like okay where where does this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m34s)
00:21:34

[go wrong for even better hopefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m35s)
00:21:35

[seeing the mistake earlier on rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m38s)
00:21:38

[than waiting for for finish so there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m41s)
00:21:41

[whole lot of like data science process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m43s)
00:21:43

[sets which you know those of you that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m47s)
00:21:47

[watch data scientists will be pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m51s)
00:21:51

[familiar with by now hopefully and those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m52s)
00:21:52

[of you that haven't it's really a case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m54s)
00:21:54

[of bringing in the software engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m57s)
00:21:57

[money set there are lots of testing of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h21m59s)
00:21:59

[iterations the more data scientists can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m03s)
00:22:03

[learn about software engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m08s)
00:22:08

[practices early together um so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m09s)
00:22:09

[very interestingly today or maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m17s)
00:22:17

[yesterday thanks books it announced that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m20s)
00:22:20

[they have implemented a enormous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m24s)
00:22:24

[improvement in the state of the art and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m27s)
00:22:27

[approximate nearest editors so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m29s)
00:22:29

[check us out if you like our essay is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m33s)
00:22:33

[safe by the way everything I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m35s)
00:22:35

[mentioned here I've mentioned earlier on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m39s)
00:22:39

[Twitter right so if you follow me on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m41s)
00:22:41

[Twitter or you know my Twitter account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m42s)
00:22:42

[you'll see all these things first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m44s)
00:22:44

[regardless of whether class is still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m46s)
00:22:46

[running or not so this was particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m48s)
00:22:48

[interesting to me you know a because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m51s)
00:22:51

[I've been talking quite a bit during](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m53s)
00:22:53

[this part of the course about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m55s)
00:22:55

[approximate nearest neighbor it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m56s)
00:22:56

[actually really important for deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h22m59s)
00:22:59

[learning and you can get a sense of how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m00s)
00:23:00

[important is by how much Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m03s)
00:23:03

[invested in this right this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m05s)
00:23:05

[multi-gpu distributed approximately rasa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m07s)
00:23:07

[native system that runs about ten times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m10s)
00:23:10

[faster than the previous set of the are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m13s)
00:23:13

[now I could to get a particular insight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m14s)
00:23:14

[into this because the earlier this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m17s)
00:23:17

[I was at a conference at Berkeley since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m19s)
00:23:19

[thanks very much to Melissa you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m24s)
00:23:24

[about the conference and texture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m26s)
00:23:26

[national people conference living me in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m28s)
00:23:28

[the day before when it had been for four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m29s)
00:23:29

[months and I chatted to young lagoon and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m31s)
00:23:31

[I chatted to him about this thing I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m36s)
00:23:36

[been thinking about a lottery that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m41s)
00:23:41

[part of course about transfer weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m42s)
00:23:42

[you know and like you know how come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m43s)
00:23:43

[people seem to always use vgg so to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m47s)
00:23:47

[best transfer learning results when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m50s)
00:23:50

[there are so much better than systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m51s)
00:23:51

[around and you know I've been really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m53s)
00:23:53

[coming to this conclusion that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m55s)
00:23:55

[reason is that fully convolutional nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m56s)
00:23:56

[like Brad's match and inception net have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h23m59s)
00:23:59

[very very large very very redundant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m03s)
00:24:03

[intermediate representations so because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m07s)
00:24:07

[they don't have a fully connected layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m09s)
00:24:09

[like in ResNet the penultimate layer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m11s)
00:24:11

[seven by seven by two thousand which a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m14s)
00:24:14

[is huge and B if you look through that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m18s)
00:24:18

[seven by seven most of them were the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m20s)
00:24:20

[same more or less as their neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m23s)
00:24:23

[right because most plasma energy similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m24s)
00:24:24

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m27s)
00:24:27

[and if you want to go back and far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m31s)
00:24:31

[enough through enough bottleneck layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m33s)
00:24:33

[if you actually get a fairly general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m35s)
00:24:35

[representation like we do with the gg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m36s)
00:24:36

[when we go to the first fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m39s)
00:24:39

[layer you're at like 28 by 28 no 500 you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m40s)
00:24:40

[know that far too big to work with and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m44s)
00:24:44

[far too redundant so I asked John McCune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m46s)
00:24:46

[about the estimate that you know with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m50s)
00:24:50

[anybody working on the question of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[how do you capture the benefits of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m54s)
00:24:54

[much more accurate architectures but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h24m57s)
00:24:57

[create efficient distributed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[representations and a lacuna slivovitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m04s)
00:25:04

[absolutely of course so where do I read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m08s)
00:25:08

[about it it is like well we visited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m11s)
00:25:11

[Facebook all the time like a Facebook we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m13s)
00:25:13

[take every object in Facebook and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m16s)
00:25:16

[create a compressed distribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m19s)
00:25:19

[representation of it and we save it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[databases and then we give little bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m22s)
00:25:22

[of code to all the groups so that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m27s)
00:25:27

[can create simple linear models on top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m29s)
00:25:29

[of these distribute representations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m31s)
00:25:31

[like this is everywhere in Facebook and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m32s)
00:25:32

[that's like oh so it is written down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m35s)
00:25:35

[somewhere there I don't know maybe - the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m37s)
00:25:37

[technical report somewhere on and if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m40s)
00:25:40

[don't know it's like one of these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m43s)
00:25:43

[that I knew it must be having and so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m44s)
00:25:44

[I know at least one company very very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m47s)
00:25:47

[big company but it's happening at a huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[scale and so when they say here that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m51s)
00:25:51

[this is used to search the multimedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m54s)
00:25:54

[documents a similar to each other if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m56s)
00:25:56

[read between the minds they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h25m58s)
00:25:58

[talking about looking at pixels or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m01s)
00:26:01

[samples of audio they're talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m04s)
00:26:04

[activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m07s)
00:26:07

[you know distributed representations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m09s)
00:26:09

[we know now like when we've talked about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m12s)
00:26:12

[perceptual losses for example how much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m14s)
00:26:14

[better it is for the CAPTCHA similarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m16s)
00:26:16

[using activations than you do using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m19s)
00:26:19

[pixels so here's a huge opportunity for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m21s)
00:26:21

[this learning which sure um you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m26s)
00:26:26

[yeah I was I'd read briefly a YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m33s)
00:26:33

[paper in which they say something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m36s)
00:26:36

[an admin I'm asking you because maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m39s)
00:26:39

[you have a better insight on how these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m40s)
00:26:40

[done I have been very interesting and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m42s)
00:26:42

[understanding it better so they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m44s)
00:26:44

[basically do some kind of embedding of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m46s)
00:26:46

[the user an embedding of a video which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m48s)
00:26:48

[is probably something kind of similar to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m51s)
00:26:51

[this and then so they first build is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m53s)
00:26:53

[this kind of representation of every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m55s)
00:26:55

[user and every video and then on top of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h26m58s)
00:26:58

[that they have another deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m00s)
00:27:00

[network that actually does everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m02s)
00:27:02

[else yeah yeah absolutely my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m04s)
00:27:04

[understanding is most as they were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m08s)
00:27:08

[vetting the based on more of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m09s)
00:27:09

[collaborative filtering approach like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m12s)
00:27:12

[is in Lesson four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m14s)
00:27:14

[I'm not to my knowledge they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[doing actual video features as far as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m19s)
00:27:19

[know so there's no reason they shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m23s)
00:27:23

[be so I now know that Facebook actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m27s)
00:27:27

[yeah right and so thinking of thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m29s)
00:27:29

[about this is like I thought about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m32s)
00:27:32

[for many years in a medical context you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m34s)
00:27:34

[know medical imaging every every medical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m36s)
00:27:36

[image you have you have a compressed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m39s)
00:27:39

[distributed representation of it such as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m41s)
00:27:41

[the first fully connected layer of vgg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m43s)
00:27:43

[it's stored in the database they want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m46s)
00:27:46

[say a database I actually mean a fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m49s)
00:27:49

[indexed approximate nearest neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m52s)
00:27:52

[tree or structure and now you can go and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m53s)
00:27:53

[grab you know every medical image to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h27m57s)
00:27:57

[display similar symptoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m00s)
00:28:00

[this medical image or whatever okay yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m01s)
00:28:01

[go from closure it gives me the thumbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m06s)
00:28:06

[so exactly so this kind of stuff is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m06s)
00:28:06

[really exciting and it's like as far as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m10s)
00:28:10

[I know it hasn't even written down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[anywhere and it's not really being used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m14s)
00:28:14

[anywhere and much other than at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[Facebook probably Google does this too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[okay so that's just a bit of background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m24s)
00:28:24

[we are going to talk about the by lsdm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[hegemony and these slides come from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m32s)
00:28:32

[Chris many so he has come across Chris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m35s)
00:28:35

[Manning before fut so Chris is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m37s)
00:28:37

[linguistics professor at Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m41s)
00:28:41

[it is PhD in linguistics and at some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m43s)
00:28:43

[point in the last small number of years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m47s)
00:28:47

[he discovered that everything he learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m50s)
00:28:50

[about it including linguistics was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m52s)
00:28:52

[basically a waste of time because now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m53s)
00:28:53

[you can throw a bidirectional lsdm word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m56s)
00:28:56

[attention at pretty much anything and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h28m59s)
00:28:59

[get a better result than everything from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m01s)
00:29:01

[his PhD in linguistics so nowadays he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m03s)
00:29:03

[actually teaches these learning and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m05s)
00:29:05

[fact his deep learning for natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m07s)
00:29:07

[language processing videos just went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m10s)
00:29:10

[online today so if you want to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m12s)
00:29:12

[more about that feel free so at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m15s)
00:29:15

[conference last week this was one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m21s)
00:29:21

[slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m23s)
00:29:23

[he put up he is describing Socrates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m24s)
00:29:24

[appointed about the situation it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[where he wants linguistics to be but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m29s)
00:29:29

[there it is and so this is what we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m31s)
00:29:31

[going to learn about today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m33s)
00:29:33

[bi-directional LSD ends with attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m35s)
00:29:35

[so this is what happened when people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m39s)
00:29:39

[started throwing bidirectional other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[schemes with attention at new york an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m43s)
00:29:43

[inflation this looks a lot like the 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[internet picture the red is the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m48s)

00:29:52

[participant machine translation process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m56s)
00:29:56

[the purple is the last four years of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h29m58s)
00:29:58

[group you know next generation approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m02s)
00:30:02

[which is syntax based digital machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m04s)
00:30:04

[translation neural machine translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m06s)
00:30:06

[didn't really appear properly into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m09s)
00:30:09

[2015 and this is the that's now on and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[we're probably well beyond that now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[because of course people you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m16s)
00:30:16

[machine translation system is now online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m18s)
00:30:18

[and a lot of the stuff that's coming out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m20s)
00:30:20

[of there for the period](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m22s)
00:30:22

[so actually back here at about 2013 I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m24s)
00:30:24

[actually go to the talk at one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m29s)
00:30:29

[academic conferences which is like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m30s)
00:30:30

[introduction to deep learning for people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m33s)
00:30:33

[in the statistics academia who maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m36s)
00:30:36

[weren't familiar with it one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m38s)
00:30:38

[things they told them was all of you who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m39s)
00:30:39

[are in NLP start learning deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[now because there's no question in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

[next three years or so it's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m45s)
00:30:45

[the state of the art and pretty much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m47s)
00:30:47

[everything and so hopefully some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m48s)
00:30:48

[those people listen to me and they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m50s)
00:30:50

[very happy like even though we couldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m51s)
00:30:51

[exactly tell at that point how that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m57s)
00:30:57

[going to happen it was just really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h30m59s)
00:30:59

[really obvious that it's like you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m00s)
00:31:00

[it could at the system which you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m02s)
00:31:02

[uses the triggered representations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m05s)
00:31:05

[you know that's all the property - she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m07s)
00:31:07

[would expect to see in something with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m10s)
00:31:10

[these learning will be successful and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m11s)
00:31:11

[you know today I think increasingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m14s)
00:31:14

[people are realizing that large areas of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m17s)
00:31:17

[basic statistics turning machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m20s)
00:31:20

[learning and the process being replaced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m23s)
00:31:23

[so crisp a digital crisp slave Chris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m25s)
00:31:25

[described the four big winds of your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m29s)
00:31:29

[machine translation and I think one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m30s)
00:31:30

[the most interesting ones is number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m33s)
00:31:33

[three which is the statistical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m34s)
00:31:34

[approaches tended to use like engrams so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m36s)
00:31:36

[like these three words of here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m41s)
00:31:41

[these three words appear these three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m43s)
00:31:43

[would appear next to each other in these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m45s)
00:31:45

[situations you can't get beyond about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m46s)
00:31:46

[five grand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m49s)
00:31:49

[so this is five words because you just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m50s)
00:31:50

[get a total exponential explosion of how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m53s)
00:31:53

[big that dataset is with our own ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m56s)
00:31:56

[remember when we very first learn about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h31m59s)
00:31:59

[our own ends we talk the reason why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m00s)
00:32:00

[steak for memory long-term dependencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m02s)
00:32:02

[right so this is exactly what you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m07s)
00:32:07

[if you want to make sure that your verb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m10s)
00:32:10

[tense and everything else lines up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m12s)
00:32:12

[your you know details of your subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m15s)
00:32:15

[they could be 20 words apart or more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m18s)
00:32:18

[right so we need to ever have that kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m20s)
00:32:20

[of thing so this is where this works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m22s)
00:32:22

[very well interestingly and you know I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m25s)
00:32:25

[not deep in the NLP world so I wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m30s)
00:32:30

[quite clear on where things are with all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m33s)
00:32:33

[of the success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m35s)
00:32:35

[yeah Chris said in his talk by all stems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m36s)
00:32:36

[with attention are the plenty are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m41s)
00:32:41

[basically everything okay and so well we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m43s)
00:32:43

[actually have an NLP person you can I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m51s)
00:32:51

[ask you a quick question Hana about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m52s)
00:32:52

[um it this kind of line up with your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h32m54s)
00:32:54

[experience as you have your own like an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m02s)
00:33:02

[NLP researcher yeah my research is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m05s)
00:33:05

[mostly information abstraction but you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m07s)
00:33:07

[know first of all if Chris Manning does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m09s)
00:33:09

[it it's true okay but also difficult in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m11s)
00:33:11

[general so the other part of this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m15s)
00:33:15

[that in some of those areas while while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m18s)
00:33:18

[this is state of the art definitely the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m23s)
00:33:23

[state of Yi ID is not that impressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m25s)
00:33:25

[Sasori a second that's definitely true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m26s)
00:33:26

[as well isn't it but he's right like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m28s)
00:33:28

[this is what's happened people have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m30s)
00:33:30

[found that for all those guys yeah and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m31s)
00:33:31

[others which are noted for their which I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m34s)
00:33:34

[was going to similar in certain ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m37s)
00:33:37

[that is the state of okay yeah what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m38s)
00:33:38

[was talking about about the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m42s)
00:33:42

[disappointing statuses so like a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m45s)
00:33:45

[these slides actually Chris Manning had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m48s)
00:33:48

[a big frowny face and one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m49s)
00:33:49

[audience is like what's with the frowny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m51s)
00:33:51

[face and it's you know he is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m52s)
00:33:52

[describing all of the ways in which the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m54s)
00:33:54

[state of the art result still a far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h33m58s)
00:33:58

[short of where we want them to be so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m00s)
00:34:00

[know NLP is by no means solved you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m01s)
00:34:01

[we could kind of say basic image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m04s)
00:34:04

[recognition is kind of solved for basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m06s)
00:34:06

[NLP is not resolved so that is a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m09s)
00:34:09

[example Chris gave of something that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m12s)
00:34:12

[know this approach has worked really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m15s)
00:34:15

[well for very difficult perfect it is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m16s)
00:34:16

[read a story like this okay and then in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m19s)
00:34:19

[the story highlights one of the words or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m23s)
00:34:23

[what phrases is deleted and the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m26s)
00:34:26

[neural net has to figure it out so Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m29s)
00:34:29

[Wars is deleted will be characters in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m31s)
00:34:31

[movies have gradually become with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m33s)
00:34:33

[burst and you have to predict Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m34s)
00:34:34

[so this is a challenging problem that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m38s)
00:34:38

[really requires some in-depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m41s)
00:34:41

[understanding and the work that Chris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m42s)
00:34:42

[showed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m47s)
00:34:47

[here's a senior researcher on is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m48s)
00:34:48

[basically take the query chuck it into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m52s)
00:34:52

[an embedding text the entire story chuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m55s)
00:34:55

[it into an R and n check the error in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h34m59s)
00:34:59

[that comes out to the whole thing with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m01s)
00:35:01

[attention and that's it okay so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m03s)
00:35:03

[talk about how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m08s)
00:35:08

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m10s)
00:35:10

[so there's a really nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m14s)
00:35:14

[so under sealed up which has a bit of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m17s)
00:35:17

[picture of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m21s)
00:35:21

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m22s)
00:35:22

[imagine we're translating English into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m25s)
00:35:25

[French so here's our English okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m28s)
00:35:28

[we're trying to translate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m32s)
00:35:32

[the European Economic Area so that is LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m36s)
00:35:36

[right but that is laughs because of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m42s)
00:35:42

[gender of the noun area so you see these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m45s)
00:35:45

[little purple lines here this is showing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m49s)
00:35:49

[that this here or network model has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m53s)
00:35:53

[learnt that when it is looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m56s)
00:35:56

[translating from the area and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[specifically the it also needs to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m04s)
00:36:04

[at the word area in order to figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m07s)
00:36:07

[that it's love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m09s)
00:36:09

[so these purple lines are showing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m10s)
00:36:10

[weights in the neural network for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m13s)
00:36:13

[translating that particular word so when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m16s)
00:36:16

[it was translating signed this is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m19s)
00:36:19

[I've talked about long term long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m22s)
00:36:22

[distance dependencies it's not just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m23s)
00:36:23

[using the word sign but also looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m25s)
00:36:25

[what was signed in order to figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m27s)
00:36:27

[the details of pattern how to use his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m29s)
00:36:29

[third right and in some things you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m32s)
00:36:32

[you kind of need to look at combination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m36s)
00:36:36

[so was fine you know you have multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m37s)
00:36:37

[prepositions working together so we need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m41s)
00:36:41

[to come up with a architecture which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m46s)
00:36:46

[capable of learning these attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m49s)
00:36:49

[waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m52s)
00:36:52

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h36m55s)
00:36:55

[as we ventured last week there's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m01s)
00:37:01

[fun paper called grammar as a foreign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m05s)
00:37:05

[language Geoffrey Hinton with the senior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m06s)
00:37:06

[research on this one has a nice little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m09s)
00:37:09

[summary this is not where it originally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m10s)
00:37:10

[came from but as a massive summary of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m12s)
00:37:12

[how attention works so let's let's go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m14s)
00:37:14

[through it like we don't often go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m20s)
00:37:20

[through we don't often go through these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m21s)
00:37:21

[things by looking at the math but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[think in this case you know the math is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m27s)
00:37:27

[simple enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m29s)
00:37:29

[so this is actually maybe a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m34s)
00:37:34

[practice so let's start off by looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m36s)
00:37:36

[for their patient okay so there's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m41s)
00:37:41

[encoder right so remember the end coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m43s)
00:37:43

[is the R and n or number of layers of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m46s)
00:37:46

[our an N which you're going to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m49s)
00:37:49

[through the original source sentence so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m51s)
00:37:51

[in this case the English sentence can it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m54s)
00:37:54

[kind of spit out a hidden state right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h37m58s)
00:37:58

[and if in carrots we say returns Lincoln](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m01s)
00:38:01

[physicals true we'll get ahead in state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m03s)
00:38:03

[after every single English word ok so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m05s)
00:38:05

[you've got ten words in the English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m10s)
00:38:10

[sentence we'll have 10 pieces of encoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m12s)
00:38:12

[set so the encoder state they're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m15s)
00:38:15

[to call it h all right and so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m19s)
00:38:19

[remember these things that are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m23s)
00:38:23

[underneath or on the top generally just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[the same as in lump I as putting single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m29s)
00:38:29

[square brackets right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m32s)
00:38:32

[so what they're doing here is they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m35s)
00:38:35

[telling us that ta so easier ta is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m36s)
00:38:36

[number of words in the English sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m43s)
00:38:43

[okay so we've got one through ta get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m47s)
00:38:47

[the safe each one's called H so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m51s)
00:38:51

[the encoder isn't there and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m54s)
00:38:54

[decoder as you run through each step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h38m57s)
00:38:57

[trying to translate this thing into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m01s)
00:39:01

[French is getting its own creating its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m02s)
00:39:02

[own hidden space that's difficult D and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m04s)
00:39:04

[D will go as far as TV that will be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m08s)
00:39:08

[highest in debt of the French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m12s)
00:39:12

[so in the end our goal is to replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m17s)
00:39:17

[every one of these so we can write these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m22s)
00:39:22

[as d-t needing each one of these items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m25s)
00:39:25

[of decoder see we're going to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m31s)
00:39:31

[create something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m36s)
00:39:36

[the - see which is going to represent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m39s)
00:39:39

[the result of this attention process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m42s)
00:39:42

[right so basically it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m48s)
00:39:48

[represent the the word and it says the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m51s)
00:39:51

[representation in the hidden state of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m55s)
00:39:55

[the word for area waited quite a lot and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h39m57s)
00:39:57

[economic weight is a little bit and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m01s)
00:40:01

[everything else - not much at all so not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m04s)
00:40:04

[surprisingly the way to do that is with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m07s)
00:40:07

[is with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m11s)
00:40:11

[a weighted sum okay so here remember H](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m15s)
00:40:15

[that's out in code of C okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m20s)
00:40:20

[the state from the RNN run over that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m23s)
00:40:23

[English sentence okay so the word for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m25s)
00:40:25

[area and circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[yes picture now we have a question to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m30s)
00:40:30

[clarify in this case instead of creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[one condensed representation vector that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m35s)
00:40:35

[captures the entire English sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m38s)
00:40:38

[here are we just looking at the existing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m40s)
00:40:40

[hidden states that get generated as the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m42s)
00:40:42

[English sentence is processed word by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m44s)
00:40:44

[word yeah exactly it's just a difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[between the terms because it equals true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m48s)
00:40:48

[versus pathetic and six equals false so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m49s)
00:40:49

[it's true it just throws away everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m52s)
00:40:52

[except the last state so but this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m54s)
00:40:54

[false throw away everything to the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m57s)
00:40:57

[state the ten seconds equals true is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h40m59s)
00:40:59

[keep it over ones in the middle and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m02s)
00:41:02

[remember importantly this is a pie LS TM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m04s)
00:41:04

[a bidirectional lsdm right so we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m09s)
00:41:09

[one LS TM going forward through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m13s)
00:41:13

[sentence and another one going backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m16s)
00:41:16

[through the center's so every one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m19s)
00:41:19

[these pieces of encoded hidden state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m21s)
00:41:21

[represents all of the words before it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m23s)
00:41:23

[that order and all of the words a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m28s)
00:41:28

[stretch in your verse order start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m29s)
00:41:29

[together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m32s)
00:41:32

[and remember also it be layers so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m32s)
00:41:32

[like quite a few layers little layers of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m34s)
00:41:34

[nonlinear neural net layer that's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m37s)
00:41:37

[on now so that's what is a state comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m41s)
00:41:41

[from so yeah so each element of H is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m43s)
00:41:43

[already a pretty complex calculation to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m48s)
00:41:48

[get there pretty sophisticated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m51s)
00:41:51

[calculation and so we're going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[those and we're going to multiply them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m55s)
00:41:55

[by some weight some weight and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h41m56s)
00:41:56

[weight see how the weights got to index](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m02s)
00:42:02

[are done that means that the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m03s)
00:42:03

[depends on two things one is T which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m05s)
00:42:05

[which word in the French translation am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m08s)
00:42:08

[I trying to create right now and I which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m11s)
00:42:11

[is which piece of encoded hidden state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[am I currently calculating the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m19s)
00:42:19

[for right so and because this is being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m21s)
00:42:21

[calculated with a function you know in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m24s)
00:42:24

[if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m28s)
00:42:28

[- with probably the you know writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[like get wait you know T comma I okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m32s)
00:42:32

[and so the line of father tells you how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m40s)
00:42:40

[to go about car planning that way but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m46s)
00:42:46

[and it tells you not surprisingly that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m48s)
00:42:48

[a calculate that wait we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m51s)
00:42:51

[using soft Max and we're going to be so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m53s)
00:42:53

[using soft Maps on top of some other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m56s)
00:42:56

[function so why soft max well if we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h42m58s)
00:42:58

[doing the weighted sum we want the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[weights to add up to 1 that's one reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m04s)
00:43:04

[secondly most of the time in translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m08s)
00:43:08

[the thing that you're translating is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m13s)
00:43:13

[largely just one word okay so 1992 is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m16s)
00:43:16

[translated as 1992 I don't even know how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m21s)
00:43:21

[to say that that's you know best serve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[this August right then sometimes it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m25s)
00:43:25

[mainly one word like in but a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m29s)
00:43:29

[of other so it's soft max because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m33s)
00:43:33

[eated of something divided by sum of e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m35s)
00:43:35

[to the something remember it tends to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m37s)
00:43:37

[very big of just one item in the vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m41s)
00:43:41

[and fairly small for everything out but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[by using soft masks we capture that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m48s)
00:43:48

[quite naturally so that's why that's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m50s)
00:43:50

[we use soft maps to calculate influence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h43m55s)
00:43:55

[that so softmax of you correct you with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m00s)
00:44:00

[another function or the result of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[another function and what is this this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m06s)
00:44:06

[is just a multi-layer perceptron with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m10s)
00:44:10

[one hidden layer a neural net with one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[hidden layer if you have a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m16s)
00:44:16

[a couple of bits of data multiplied by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m20s)
00:44:20

[weight matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m23s)
00:44:23

[put to a non-linearity x and other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m27s)
00:44:27

[weight metrics but through another loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m31s)
00:44:31

[non-linearity so that's the definition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m34s)
00:44:34

[of a neural net with one hidden layer so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m37s)
00:44:37

[when it all comes down to it what this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m42s)
00:44:42

[all says is in order to calculate the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m44s)
00:44:44

[weights on each of the source encoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m47s)
00:44:47

[words for each of the target translated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m52s)
00:44:52

[word train a tiny little neural net with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[one hidden layer which learns to figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m02s)
00:45:02

[out which soft words translate down okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m05s)
00:45:05

[and so remember one of the things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m10s)
00:45:10

[Chris mentioned in his like what way is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m12s)
00:45:12

[your machine translation good one of his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m14s)
00:45:14

[reasons was because it's end-to-end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m16s)
00:45:16

[trainable we're going to invest this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m18s)
00:45:18

[many neural net inside the bigger R and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m21s)
00:45:21

[n so the whole thing is going to be just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m24s)
00:45:24

[fgz all in one go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m26s)
00:45:26

[okay so that's what we're going to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m29s)
00:45:29

[and do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m31s)
00:45:31

[make sure that clear before we look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m34s)
00:45:34

[the code that how to do it anybody a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m38s)
00:45:38

[couple persons there they're just quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m40s)
00:45:40

[so how's our hidden state looks like is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m44s)
00:45:44

[it like set of activations yeah so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m47s)
00:45:47

[he says it's just a normal LSD and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m50s)
00:45:50

[hidden safe so it's just a data if they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m52s)
00:45:52

[go back to we got a question right over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h45m56s)
00:45:56

[there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m02s)
00:46:02

[so anytime like you want to remind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m08s)
00:46:08

[yourself of what's really going on with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m11s)
00:46:11

[iron ends go back to this lesson 5 iron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m14s)
00:46:14

[in PowerPoint because we go through and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[we remember like ok this is not an iron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m19s)
00:46:19

[end you know here's a basic neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m21s)
00:46:21

[and we could like have a multi-layered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m23s)
00:46:23

[neural net and then we can have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m27s)
00:46:27

[multi-layer neural net which we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m28s)
00:46:28

[second input coming in still not on our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[end we could have two things something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m33s)
00:46:33

[in a treatise of x and then we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m35s)
00:46:35

[also tie these weight matrices and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m37s)
00:46:37

[the notebook that goes with this part we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m39s)
00:46:39

[do all this like by hand in care out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m43s)
00:46:43

[all the web time and everything's you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m46s)
00:46:46

[see every set and then we realize oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m47s)
00:46:47

[that last picture could have been drawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[like that okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m52s)
00:46:52

[and we also realized we could do this as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m55s)
00:46:55

[well right so so all of these circles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h46m59s)
00:46:59

[represent just a bunch of applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m03s)
00:47:03

[of the vector validation and so we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m05s)
00:47:05

[a bunch of these layers until eventually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m08s)
00:47:08

[we decide to keep some final set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m12s)
00:47:12

[ambition so this is this is all we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m15s)
00:47:15

[doing and so then the I don't want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m17s)
00:47:17

[call the attentional model yeah it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m22s)
00:47:22

[relatively simple it's just a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m24s)
00:47:24

[single thing load and there's other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m26s)
00:47:26

[reason that it wasn't more complex or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m27s)
00:47:27

[some fancy architecture you know I'd be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m29s)

[wondering with those I don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m31s)
00:47:31

[I guess the answer is it seems to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m36s)
00:47:36

[you know there's no reason you couldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m38s)
00:47:38

[have too many motors I guess you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m41s)
00:47:41

[it's so easy to go back and look and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m46s)
00:47:46

[what the attentions are presumably so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m51s)
00:47:51

[far they're basically using this they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m54s)
00:47:54

[finding that the essential model is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m55s)
00:47:55

[getting the correct size I think if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h47m57s)
00:47:57

[you're trying to do an attentional model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m00s)
00:48:00

[for something else and that doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m01s)
00:48:01

[happen so yeah check another layer in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[fact how'd this up this terrific post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m08s)
00:48:08

[actually shows a really cool example of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m12s)
00:48:12

[this which is on the bottom here as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m14s)
00:48:14

[sound wave and on the top is the speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m16s)
00:48:16

[recognition and so you know people are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m20s)
00:48:20

[actually using attention models to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m22s)
00:48:22

[automatically do speech recognition by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m25s)
00:48:25

[figuring out which parts of the sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m27s)
00:48:27

[wave represented which butters and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m30s)
00:48:30

[fact one of the super cool things to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m34s)
00:48:34

[come out this this week was the taco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m36s)
00:48:36

[trot which is one of the best names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m42s)
00:48:42

[repect I've come across and the taco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m45s)
00:48:45

[Tron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m49s)
00:48:49

[have some fantastic examples actually of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m52s)
00:48:52

[what it sounds like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m56s)
00:48:56

[nominees if I can guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h48m58s)
00:48:58

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m01s)

[basilar membrane and Oh charlie rangel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m03s)
00:49:03

[gr not autocorrelation so the cool thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m05s)
00:49:05

[here is like it changes depending on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m09s)
00:49:09

[like where the punctuation is pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m13s)
00:49:13

[aggressively or even whether those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m15s)

[capitals up the buses aren't the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m16s)
00:49:16

[they actually provide a solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m19s)
00:49:19

[problem they actually provide a solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m25s)
00:49:25

[or questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m28s)
00:49:28

[so the quick brown fox jumped over the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m31s)
00:49:31

[lazy dog so with this kind of intro in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m32s)
00:49:32

[training like this right you don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m38s)
00:49:38

[to really build anything special and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m44s)
00:49:44

[make that happen you just need to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m47s)
00:49:47

[sure that you're labeled data is correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m48s)
00:49:48

[and actually somebody pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m51s)
00:49:51

[something really neat the other day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[which is if you want to build a speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[recognition system so one easy way to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m56s)
00:49:56

[it would be like perhaps inaudible calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h49m59s)
00:49:59

[audiobooks and the actual books and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[you could have 40 hours of training date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m05s)
00:50:05

[on of that so in fact if you grab the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m07s)
00:50:07

[Stephen Fry reading Harry Potter and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m10s)
00:50:10

[could like have that every Harry Potter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m12s)
00:50:12

[voice as well so this is a this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m14s)
00:50:14

[super amazing technique and surprisingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m19s)
00:50:19

[enough this single hidden layer seems to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[be enough to do attention pretty well so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m25s)
00:50:25

[last week we were looking at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m31s)
00:50:31

[spelling bee right whether you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m33s)
00:50:33

[input were things like the the key and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m34s)
00:50:34

[we were having to figure out to sell it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m40s)
00:50:40

[to wiki we tried it without attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m43s)
00:50:43

[and we didn't get great results we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m47s)
00:50:47

[looked at the paper from the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m49s)
00:50:49

[battle or a towel paper that shows that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m51s)
00:50:51

[with longer sentences in particular you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m54s)
00:50:54

[get much better results if you do use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m56s)
00:50:56

[attention so let's have a look and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h50m58s)
00:50:58

[what that looks like so here US doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m02s)
00:51:02

[really have anything to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m06s)
00:51:06

[effectively so I have to write something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m07s)
00:51:07

[so before I show what I wrote let me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m09s)
00:51:09

[describe kind of what it looks like most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m12s)
00:51:12

[of it looks exactly the same as the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m16s)
00:51:16

[original spelling bee model we have our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m18s)
00:51:18

[list of phonemes at the input we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m21s)
00:51:21

[our list of letters spell the word with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m26s)
00:51:26

[as our decoder decoder input we check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m29s)
00:51:29

[them both through embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m35s)
00:51:35

[we then do a bidirectional are an M on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m41s)
00:51:41

[the phoneme and then we check and hone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m44s)
00:51:44

[in on top of that and check inherently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m47s)
00:51:47

[on top of that right you might remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m48s)
00:51:48

[from last time is Karen in function just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m50s)
00:51:50

[to remind you it just was returning in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m53s)
00:51:53

[our cm and by default we're saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m56s)
00:51:56

[returns because because true perhaps the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h51m59s)
00:51:59

[last week the final one was get our own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m02s)
00:52:02

[in false we put everything into a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m05s)
00:52:05

[little package and then we set that to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m08s)
00:52:08

[the RN but now we're leading return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m10s)
00:52:10

[sequences equals true all the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m15s)
00:52:15

[through so that we can then pass that to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m17s)
00:52:17

[this special attention layer that I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m19s)
00:52:19

[created we're looking at how this works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m21s)
00:52:21

[at the moment but let's first of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m24s)
00:52:24

[talk about like what does an intention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m26s)
00:52:26

[layer need it needs to know what kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m28s)
00:52:28

[RNN layer do you wanted to create right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m32s)
00:52:32

[so I just passed it a function which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m35s)
00:52:35

[creates inherit in layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m37s)
00:52:37

[okay I'm in your decoder how many layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m40s)
00:52:40

[do you want to create so I say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m43s)
00:52:43

[create three lsdm layers in the decoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m45s)
00:52:45

[and then what information is it going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m48s)
00:52:48

[need to create that it's going to need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m51s)
00:52:51

[these all of the encoder States versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m53s)
00:52:53

[sitting in here and then we can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h52m57s)
00:52:57

[something else to make it easier we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m01s)
00:53:01

[do two encored teacher forcing and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m03s)
00:53:03

[teacher forcing is when you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m06s)
00:53:06

[pass it as well as the encoded state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m07s)
00:53:07

[we're going to pass it the answer but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[we're going to pass it the answer for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[the previous time period right so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m16s)
00:53:16

[other words if we're trying to learn how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m19s)
00:53:19

[to spell the wiki at set one we're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[going to pass it anywhere at set two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m28s)
00:53:28

[were part of Z at step three were part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m31s)
00:53:31

[of Y therefore were part of W in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m34s)
00:53:34

[words we're going to tell it what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m37s)
00:53:37

[previous time steps correct answer was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m39s)
00:53:39

[why do we do that it makes it much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m41s)
00:53:41

[easier to train tickly early on but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m44s)
00:53:44

[early on it has no idea how to spell and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m48s)
00:53:48

[so it gets most things wrong most of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m51s)
00:53:51

[time and so the let the later letters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m54s)
00:53:54

[everything's wrong before it so happy to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h53m58s)
00:53:58

[possibly know what letter to use now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m00s)
00:54:00

[okay so with teacher fourteen we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m02s)
00:54:02

[going to take our sign Churchill we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m07s)
00:54:07

[going to take our input data being all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m11s)
00:54:11

[of those encoded hidden state but we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m15s)
00:54:15

[also going to tell us all right even if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m18s)
00:54:18

[you've got the previous letter wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m20s)
00:54:20

[this is what I should have seen right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m21s)
00:54:21

[and so it's just it's going to make it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m24s)
00:54:24

[bit easier for it and all we do is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m26s)
00:54:26

[just concatenate together the giving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m28s)
00:54:28

[space plus that that decoder input so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m30s)
00:54:30

[that's called teacher 40 right you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m35s)
00:54:35

[have to use teacher forcing but if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m37s)
00:54:37

[do it just makes it faster and easier to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m40s)
00:54:40

[train so that's why we pass in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m43s)
00:54:43

[special decoder input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m48s)
00:54:48

[and just to show you the decoder imports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m51s)
00:54:51

[yeah the decoder input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h54m56s)
00:54:56

[okay yeah so if all of my labels right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m07s)
00:55:07

[except not the very last one okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m13s)
00:55:13

[it's going to be one less to the full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m17s)
00:55:17

[number of items to film lettuce the cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m19s)
00:55:19

[and then I can calculate a column of one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m24s)
00:55:24

[on to the front now why is the column of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m29s)
00:55:29

[plot so one with x go token and then go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m31s)
00:55:31

[token with something that I set up on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m36s)
00:55:36

[that here here yeah I decided that an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m39s)
00:55:39

[asterisk right so an Asterix is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m46s)
00:55:46

[be like a special character which mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[this is the start of the word okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m51s)
00:55:51

[we're going to get past every time going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m54s)
00:55:54

[to get past before the wiki we'd get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m56s)
00:55:56

[past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h55m59s)
00:55:59

[Asterix then why WIC 10 that's that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m02s)
00:56:02

[going to be this teacher 14 informal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m08s)
00:56:08

[okay so this attention layer is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m15s)
00:56:15

[create a three layer RM it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m19s)
00:56:19

[get given all of the encoded states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m21s)
00:56:21

[going to get given that special decoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m22s)
00:56:22

[input and it's going to spit out just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m25s)
00:56:25

[the list of six again and so we can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m30s)
00:56:30

[do the usual thing of doing a time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m34s)
00:56:34

[distributive dense with our appropriate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m36s)
00:56:36

[boat capsized softmax to turn that into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m38s)
00:56:38

[child target activations so putting it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m43s)
00:56:43

[aside how we calculate this everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m46s)
00:56:46

[else is pretty familiar and so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m50s)
00:56:50

[let's go ahead build that model compiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m52s)
00:56:52

[fish passing in both the the phonemes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h56m55s)
00:56:55

[and those decoder inputs trainer for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m02s)
00:57:02

[while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m07s)
00:57:07

[bit of annealing trended a bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m07s)
00:57:07

[until eventually we have actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m10s)
00:57:10

[pretty good accuracy 51 percent and here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m13s)
00:57:13

[it is did you have a question here sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[yes there's a question do you know if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m20s)
00:57:20

[the current work strictly uses the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m22s)
00:57:22

[hidden states of the final RNN layer or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m24s)
00:57:24

[if people try using attention sums over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m26s)
00:57:26

[different indices over multiple layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m29s)
00:57:29

[the way we did in using perceptual loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m31s)
00:57:31

[for multiple layers you know that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m33s)
00:57:33

[actually a great question the answer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m36s)
00:57:36

[to a knowledge people are always using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m38s)
00:57:38

[the last layer it is same but I kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m40s)
00:57:40

[accidentally use all of them once and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m44s)
00:57:44

[got some better results so I don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m47s)
00:57:47

[if I screwed something up or if this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m51s)
00:57:51

[a good idea so that might be something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m53s)
00:57:53

[if you want to test it in order to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m55s)
00:57:55

[it out yeah I was like after fixing a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h57m58s)
00:57:58

[bug things got worse it's a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m03s)
00:58:03

[with fine so maybe it's not a bug after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m06s)
00:58:06

[all um so remember last time we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m09s)
00:58:09

[trouble with a really long words we love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m12s)
00:58:12

[the funny but here's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m14s)
00:58:14

[phonemes and it's done it perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m15s)
00:58:15

[actually that's a good sign that this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m18s)
00:58:18

[handling some longer ones pretty well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m21s)
00:58:21

[and you know is 51% good or bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m23s)
00:58:23

[I don't know right because like spelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m26s)
00:58:26

[is you know it's not exact right there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m29s)
00:58:29

[no way you could algorithmically get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m34s)
00:58:34

[100% going like is it Mississippi speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m36s)
00:58:36

[like this or speak like this you consume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m39s)
00:58:39

[a test set right there's no way for to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m41s)
00:58:41

[know so I think it's done pretty well so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m43s)
00:58:43

[the only thing remaining is how to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[this tension layer so the bad news is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m52s)
00:58:52

[that the attention layer is the largest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h58m54s)
00:58:54

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m01s)
00:59:01

[the largest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[custom layer we've looked out and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m08s)
00:59:08

[not terrible but it's a it's a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m10s)
00:59:10

[lines of code okay but a lot of its kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m13s)
00:59:13

[of pretty repetitive so it really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[depends how interested you are a in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m22s)
00:59:22

[custom layers and be in attention as to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m24s)
00:59:24

[how much you want to look at this some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m26s)
00:59:26

[but basically I'll show you the key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[features right there are two really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m30s)
00:59:30

[important methods that they're called in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m33s)
00:59:33

[your custom layer and they are Bill and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m37s)
00:59:37

[build is the method that's called in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m38s)
00:59:38

[your custom layer when your layer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m42s)
00:59:42

[actually inserted into a neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m44s)
00:59:44

[and that that causes get built right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m46s)
00:59:46

[when once it's inserted into a into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m50s)
00:59:50

[carrot neural network and that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m52s)
00:59:52

[point at which it knows how big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m55s)
00:59:55

[everything has to be right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m56s)
00:59:56

[you're told and having the input was and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=00h59m58s)
00:59:58

[then you've got the another various](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m00s)
01:00:00

[layers connected for each other and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m02s)
01:00:02

[eventually you can figure out how beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m03s)
01:00:03

[is you know in fact specifically what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[the shape of the input right so when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m09s)
01:00:09

[your build method is called you get told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m11s)
01:00:11

[what is the shape of your input and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m13s)
01:00:13

[is the point where you now have to set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m16s)
01:00:16

[everything up to work with that input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m19s)
01:00:19

[shape now in this case bill would get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m21s)
01:00:21

[called as soon as it finishes running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m25s)
01:00:25

[this line right because it knows that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[got this input right and it can figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m29s)
01:00:29

[out this input shape by going all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m32s)
01:00:32

[way back to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m35s)
01:00:35

[now we have two inputs and we have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m37s)
01:00:37

[encode of state and the decoder input so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m40s)
01:00:40

[we can follow the part in to the encoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m43s)
01:00:43

[shape and the decoded internship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m45s)
01:00:45

[so some things we've seen like they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m50s)
01:00:50

[might be hard actually incredibly easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m52s)
01:00:52

[to create my three layers are items is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m53s)
01:00:53

[single line of code remember I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m56s)
01:00:56

[passed in the air and end generating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h00m59s)
01:00:59

[function grab Titus column for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m02s)
01:01:02

[player right and with a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m05s)
01:01:05

[comprehension I now have there is three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m08s)
01:01:08

[RNN loads in a list that is easy on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m11s)
01:01:11

[other hand to do this I'm going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m16s)
01:01:16

[to do it all by hand right and in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m22s)
01:01:22

[there's some things are being hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m24s)
01:01:24

[here for example a bias term is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m25s)
01:01:25

[included here but if we definitely want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m29s)
01:01:29

[one it's like people often don't include](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m31s)
01:01:31

[bias term because you'd like to convoys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m34s)
01:01:34

[avoid it by like adding a column of one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m36s)
01:01:36

[your data so like it's common in math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m39s)
01:01:39

[not to mention the highest term they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m43s)
01:01:43

[federally speaking anytime you see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m45s)
01:01:45

[neural net and let's say state otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m47s)
01:01:47

[there's probably a virus in there so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m49s)
01:01:49

[have to in build we're going to have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m54s)
01:01:54

[create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m56s)
01:01:56

[W 1 W 2 and V ok to create them Kerris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h01m57s)
01:01:57

[actually has a convenient method that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m05s)
01:02:05

[comes from the layer superclass called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m08s)
01:02:08

[Edward right so add ways you basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m10s)
01:02:10

[say if I want the size of the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m13s)
01:02:13

[matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m14s)
01:02:14

[plus your initialization function and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m16s)
01:02:16

[give it a name so I just took that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m18s)
01:02:18

[brought it W right so here I guess go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m23s)
01:02:23

[wwwww passing in all right so if W one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m29s)
01:02:29

[topic is second a bit W to have a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m32s)
01:02:32

[second of these here's my bias because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m36s)
01:02:36

[that going to be is my V so because that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m39s)
01:02:39

[going to be and then I've got two other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m42s)
01:02:42

[things here which is the w3 the p3 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m44s)
01:02:44

[that's because this is kind of hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m48s)
01:02:48

[braved over something which is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m50s)
01:02:50

[final answer basically needs to become](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m53s)
01:02:53

[the hidden state right of your next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[layer of the RNN but it might not be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m01s)
01:03:01

[right size so then I just added one more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m03s)
01:03:03

[transformation to the end to basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m06s)
01:03:06

[make it the red silence and in some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m10s)
01:03:10

[the attention model cases they to lay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m13s)
01:03:13

[that out so I don't know like whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m16s)
01:03:16

[Insurance Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m18s)
01:03:18

[just ignore it or maybe they built it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[that the shapes work anyway I don't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m23s)
01:03:23

[so we've got one extra one extra half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m25s)
01:03:25

[and transmission a minor note for those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m28s)
01:03:28

[of you have played with high score I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m35s)
01:03:35

[sure you've discovered how cool it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m36s)
01:03:36

[that you can go self add module and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m38s)
01:03:38

[keeps track of like everything that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m41s)
01:03:41

[need to train or the parameters Terrace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m42s)
01:03:42

[is not so clever so that's why we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[to go self to add weight to every one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m48s)
01:03:48

[these weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m51s)
01:03:51

[I'm compare us have to know what to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[train when you optimize what should you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m54s)
01:03:54

[train unfortunately when we created all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m56s)
01:03:56

[these are n ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m58s)
01:03:58

[these are a tens of lots of weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h03m59s)
01:03:59

[which we haven't told Cara that we need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m01s)
01:04:01

[to optimize them so I actually hadn't I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m06s)
01:04:06

[have not found any examples of custom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m08s)
01:04:08

[layers anywhere on the internet where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m11s)
01:04:11

[people have actually done this but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m13s)
01:04:13

[figured out what you can do is you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m16s)
01:04:16

[basically press this little function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m18s)
01:04:18

[that go through every one of my layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m21s)
01:04:21

[every one of those are and in layers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m24s)
01:04:24

[find all the attributes that Kaos needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m27s)
01:04:27

[to know about so it needs to know what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[at the trainable weights and on general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m33s)
01:04:33

[weights losses up and constraints so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m35s)
01:04:35

[anyway you can copy and paste this code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m37s)
01:04:37

[if you want to create a custom layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m39s)
01:04:39

[which is self-contained some chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m40s)
01:04:40

[layers of intensive code and it seems to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m42s)
01:04:42

[work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m45s)
01:04:45

[that is really much ok so that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m46s)
01:04:46

[first main thing you have to create when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m50s)
01:04:50

[you create a custom layer is build some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m53s)
01:04:53

[training build is really boring because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m56s)
01:04:56

[you have to get all these money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h04m58s)
01:04:58

[dimensions to a pre correct which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m01s)
01:05:01

[obtained in the ER and so when I built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m03s)
01:05:03

[that I've had to fit all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m05s)
01:05:05

[bunch of like tensorflow playing around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m09s)
01:05:09

[code where I'll just keep going in and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m13s)
01:05:13

[being like okay if this is my X this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m15s)
01:05:15

[the size of my w1 let's try you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m18s)
01:05:18

[during each calculation so I liked it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m20s)
01:05:20

[each calculation in a Cell one step at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m22s)
01:05:22

[time and you know look to see what other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m25s)
01:05:25

[shapes were and then with that can put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m27s)
01:05:27

[them in so you know like I don't think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m29s)
01:05:29

[any normal mortal person could like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m31s)
01:05:31

[write all of these dimensionalities in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m33s)
01:05:33

[there to get into work without doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m36s)
01:05:36

[them one little set a plan so make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m38s)
01:05:38

[things easy for yourself so the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m41s)
01:05:41

[key thing that happens in the lair is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m44s)
01:05:44

[call home and call it the thing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m47s)
01:05:47

[basically that's your just your forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[path and this is like okay this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m54s)
01:05:54

[calculate go calculate and so you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m56s)
01:05:56

[passed in the data the caps going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h05m59s)
01:05:59

[right so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m03s)
01:06:03

[come we actually have to step through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m09s)
01:06:09

[the sets of an RNN and Kara actually has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m13s)
01:06:13

[a k dot r NN function which is very very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m17s)
01:06:17

[similar to CR no dots can cause remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m22s)
01:06:22

[theano dot sin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m26s)
01:06:26

[this is basically something which it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m27s)
01:06:27

[called some functions that each step etc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m29s)
01:06:29

[each part of your input as some initial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m33s)
01:06:33

[States and so forth but it's almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[identical to see oh no goddamn right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m40s)
01:06:40

[it's a really low level thing and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m43s)
01:06:43

[some Terrace really doesn't have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[convenient user facing API so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m51s)
01:06:51

[creating custom R and n code in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m55s)
01:06:55

[this is something which nobody's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h06m59s)
01:06:59

[figured out yet tensorflow has just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m01s)
01:07:01

[released a new kind of customer and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m07s)
01:07:07

[API but there isn't any documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m11s)
01:07:11

[for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m14s)
01:07:14

[so I was hoping to feature in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m16s)
01:07:16

[course but I think it's just a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m19s)
01:07:19

[too early and I don't know if it's good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m20s)
01:07:20

[or not so you know this is this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m24s)
01:07:24

[a bit of an open question really is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m25s)
01:07:25

[how do you create something as easy to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m29s)
01:07:29

[use as kara that with the flexibility to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m30s)
01:07:30

[design your own kind of R and n details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m33s)
01:07:33

[you know and as you can see in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m37s)
01:07:37

[it wasn't it wasn't convenient at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m39s)
01:07:39

[you know I had to go back and kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[run you know run this scan function from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m44s)
01:07:44

[scratch and set everything out good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m47s)
01:07:47

[stretch anyway so basically all the work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m48s)
01:07:48

[happens in here which means all the work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m51s)
01:07:51

[is happening in this step function I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m53s)
01:07:53

[created but here's where the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m56s)
01:07:56

[calculations of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m58s)
01:07:58

[so here's most def function and so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[the end when it actually gets to it this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m01s)
01:08:01

[now looks a lot like the Hinton team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m04s)
01:08:04

[code right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m07s)
01:08:07

[we basically can see us doing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m09s)
01:08:09

[adoption at the bias and here's the ban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m12s)
01:08:12

[and here's the V and the softmax and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m16s)
01:08:16

[here's the bit where we do the weighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m20s)
01:08:20

[sum right and then this is just one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m22s)
01:08:22

[extra step I mentioned which is to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m25s)
01:08:25

[it to the right shape for the rmn again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m27s)
01:08:27

[and so now that I've done all of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m29s)
01:08:29

[pre-processing okay - basically I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m32s)
01:08:32

[started with X and I ended up creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m34s)
01:08:34

[this thing called H you can now go ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m37s)
01:08:37

[and go through all of those three RNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m40s)
01:08:40

[calling step on each of those okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m43s)
01:08:43

[that you know this probably shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m48s)
01:08:48

[have been that hard in the end but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m50s)
01:08:50

[just the nature of kind of the chaos API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m53s)
01:08:53

[but it's stuff that doesn't really exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m55s)
01:08:55

[that we had to go in and create it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m57s)
01:08:57

[all we really wanted to do was say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h08m59s)
01:08:59

[Kara before you run the free decoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m02s)
01:09:02

[ardennes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m07s)
01:09:07

[take your input and modify it in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m07s)
01:09:07

[way okay so that's but we have to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m12s)
01:09:12

[for every sin you know that's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[what was missing is some wearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m20s)
01:09:20

[character easily say to say like change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m22s)
01:09:22

[the extent so I've spoken to France well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m25s)
01:09:25

[you know the careless offer about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m29s)
01:09:29

[is well aware that it is not convenient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m30s)
01:09:30

[right now and he really wants to fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m33s)
01:09:33

[this but I mean this is difficult to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m35s)
01:09:35

[right no one's quite done it yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m38s)
01:09:38

[and we have a question and I didn't get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m41s)
01:09:41

[to getting it to the right shape again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m44s)
01:09:44

[part could you explain that again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m46s)
01:09:46

[children so dead thank you for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m47s)
01:09:47

[question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m52s)
01:09:52

[set it's being called for every time set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m52s)
01:09:52

[so at the end of it we have to return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m56s)
01:09:56

[the new hidden set and then that new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h09m59s)
01:09:59

[hidden state is going to come back into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m02s)
01:10:02

[the next step right so in other words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m04s)
01:10:04

[the thing that we end up with here needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m07s)
01:10:07

[to be the same shape as we had here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m10s)
01:10:10

[right so but it that doesn't happen you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m15s)
01:10:15

[know automatically because we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[actually taking this this weighted sum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m24s)
01:10:24

[and we're actually contaminating onto it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m31s)
01:10:31

[the decoder input we end up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m34s)
01:10:34

[something that's a totally different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m38s)
01:10:38

[shape so but you can always change the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m41s)
01:10:41

[shape of state by chucking a trivial mo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m45s)
01:10:45

[multiplying it by a matrix where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m48s)
01:10:48

[thing you multiply it by it has a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m50s)
01:10:50

[of columns if you want to create right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m52s)
01:10:52

[so Plato's made sure the w3 has the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m54s)
01:10:54

[number of columns as as the H that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h10m58s)
01:10:58

[want add and so as a result but by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m01s)
01:11:01

[end of this we've got something which we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m04s)
01:11:04

[can feed back into the errand and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m07s)
01:11:07

[you know we just need to make sure you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m09s)
01:11:09

[know what R and n set can't change the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m10s)
01:11:10

[shape that it started with writes it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m13s)
01:11:13

[needs to be able to keep going set set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m15s)
01:11:15

[set every step things to be the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m16s)
01:11:16

[emphasize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[and you showed how you figured out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m21s)
01:11:21

[tested the tensor shapes how did you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m23s)
01:11:23

[bug the attention class itself as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m27s)
01:11:27

[whole our RNs easier and cleaner and PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m29s)
01:11:29

[torch with the attention class have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m33s)
01:11:33

[relatively easier in by torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m36s)
01:11:36

[what if I told you Rebecca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m39s)
01:11:39

[so the main thing for me to see if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m43s)
01:11:43

[really was built right because this bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m46s)
01:11:46

[is Jeffrey humans or nativity scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m50s)
01:11:50

[equations right there's not too much to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m54s)
01:11:54

[get wrong here so really it was the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h11m56s)
01:11:56

[cases like I'm doing it as if they like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m01s)
01:12:01

[step by step in cells and printing out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m07s)
01:12:07

[the shape at each point and you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m11s)
01:12:11

[that like I created these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m14s)
01:12:14

[you know all of these different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m17s)
01:12:17

[dimensions at the side right and I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m18s)
01:12:18

[sure all of these numbers are different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m21s)
01:12:21

[so that every time I saw the number 64 I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m22s)
01:12:22

[knew that was the batch size to live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m25s)
01:12:25

[contort for I'm you go time steps 32 is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m26s)
01:12:26

[the input then 48 of the opportunity so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m29s)
01:12:29

[I could go through and I could see okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m33s)
01:12:33

[is my shaky a push up here and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m35s)
01:12:35

[know all I just did was I just chucked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m41s)
01:12:41

[in some print statements you know print](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m43s)
01:12:43

[HW to print you with a and so forth and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m45s)
01:12:45

[so I didn't even see the contents of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m49s)
01:12:49

[them when you print a tensor flow tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m53s)
01:12:53

[like that it prints the dimensions of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m55s)
01:12:55

[which in my experience once your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h12m57s)
01:12:57

[dimensions work you're done and as long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m00s)
01:13:00

[as you didn't make the mistake of having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m03s)
01:13:03

[multiple things having the same number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m05s)
01:13:05

[of dimensions because it's like you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m07s)
01:13:07

[as long as your product you know this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m10s)
01:13:10

[and you know if if H and W 2 didn't line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m14s)
01:13:14

[up for rows and columns you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m19s)
01:13:19

[error you get is pretty clear you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m21s)
01:13:21

[it'll be a tensor flow play the mismatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m23s)
01:13:23

[and show you what the dimensions are and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m25s)
01:13:25

[so you can you know so generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m27s)
01:13:27

[speaking getting these things a mess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m29s)
01:13:29

[isn't too bad yeah I don't know it's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m30s)
01:13:30

[fun at all but it's kind of menial if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m36s)
01:13:36

[you know you'll get there of industries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m42s)
01:13:42

[so now that's done you know I've written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m44s)
01:13:44

[it right so feel free to use it as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m48s)
01:13:48

[can see it's easy to use and at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m51s)
01:13:51

[you know we get these pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m56s)
01:13:56

[results one thing to point out is when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h13m57s)
01:13:57

[we go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m03s)
01:14:03

[so we get the predictions right by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m08s)
01:14:08

[same model dropper date for that test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m11s)
01:14:11

[set right and then those predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m14s)
01:14:14

[you'll notice we go split while its uses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m18s)
01:14:18

[later one predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m23s)
01:14:23

[fikriye not split on underscore why'd we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m27s)
01:14:27

[spit on underscore and that's because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m31s)
01:14:31

[when I created the vocabulary earlier on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m33s)
01:14:33

[I fit underscore to be the zero element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m35s)
01:14:35

[and remember that all of our words are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m38s)
01:14:38

[padded at the end of zeros so when the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m42s)
01:14:42

[decoder predicts that this is the end of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m45s)
01:14:45

[the word it's going to spit out zero or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m48s)
01:14:48

[underscore right so this is a kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m52s)
01:14:52

[power decoder knows to stop now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m56s)
01:14:56

[it doesn't actually stop like in terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h14m59s)
01:14:59

[of computation the decode is still going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m01s)
01:15:01

[to keep plant letting all of the rest of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m04s)
01:15:04

[the sense because we don't have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m06s)
01:15:06

[ability at least in care us to say stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m08s)
01:15:08

[now you know everything is rectangled so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[hopefully the decoder learned pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m13s)
01:15:13

[quickly that if the previous token was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m17s)
01:15:17

[underscore the next token will always be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[underscore right once you finish this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m23s)
01:15:23

[sandwich so that's a minor issue then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m25s)
01:15:25

[okay so that's that so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m28s)
01:15:28

[have a seven minute break and when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m31s)
01:15:31

[come back we're going to see this in PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h15m34s)

[writing all these like I can values and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h16m03s)

[eigenvectors equations allow to do any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h16m05s)

[like idea is something in this style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h16m07s)

[mathematical technique it's almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h16m55s)
01:16:55

[similar so hopefully by next week I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h16m59s)
01:16:59

[won't understand it enough that that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m03s)
01:17:03

[anymore actually explain it to you but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m05s)
01:17:05

[know what are the key differences is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m07s)
01:17:07

[actually using the earth moves in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m09s)
01:17:09

[distance which is the basis that there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m10s)
01:17:10

[was a sign game about this idea so I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m12s)
01:17:12

[been to avoid teaching about eigenvalues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[and eigenvectors over which oh yeah I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[don't know how we're going to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m23s)
01:17:23

[anyway that is like yeah so there this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m24s)
01:17:24

[is a breakfast yeah this is this has got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m29s)
01:17:29

[to be a paper like yeah you know if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[disappear to the whole new change this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[is super exciting so congratulations I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m40s)
01:17:40

[look forward to learning more about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m44s)
01:17:44

[you know people just keep doing cold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m50s)
01:17:50

[sauce I love it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m53s)
01:17:53

[you know you guys just different along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h17m57s)
01:17:57

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m01s)
01:18:01

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m04s)
01:18:04

[all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m05s)
01:18:05

[so let's translate English into French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m11s)
01:18:11

[right now here the problem the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m13s)
01:18:13

[teacher for thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m20s)
01:18:20

[this is fun Oh question I was then going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m23s)
01:18:23

[to say just the two questions I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m29s)
01:18:29

[from right before the break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m32s)
01:18:32

[one was could we use time distributed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m33s)
01:18:33

[lambda right before the RNN okay so so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m36s)
01:18:36

[no you can't so what this question is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m40s)
01:18:40

[getting at is like you know why don't we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m44s)
01:18:44

[use the lambda player to do the you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m49s)
01:18:49

[the the attention calculations and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m54s)
01:18:54

[feed that into the sand and irn but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h18m58s)
01:18:58

[remember those calculations are being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m00s)
01:19:00

[done inside the set function right so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m03s)
01:19:03

[other words each step uses attention to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m06s)
01:19:06

[calculate the output of the step which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m09s)
01:19:09

[impacts the next set so if you inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m10s)
01:19:10

[the are an end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m14s)
01:19:14

[you can't just pre-process the whole lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m15s)
01:19:15

[then the next question was is there any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m19s)
01:19:19

[reason why we used hyperbolic tanh as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m22s)
01:19:22

[opposed to sigmoid no no reason middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m25s)
01:19:25

[so so hyperbolic tanh and Sigma way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m28s)
01:19:28

[the same thing hyperbolic tanh mission -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m33s)
01:19:33

[one - one second with custom 0 to 1 the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m35s)
01:19:35

[size is fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m39s)
01:19:39

[okay teacher for thing with this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m43s)
01:19:43

[where we're concatenating the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m46s)
01:19:46

[previous correct answers embedding with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m52s)
01:19:52

[our attention weighted encoder inputs in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h19m58s)
01:19:58

[order to kind of help our staff our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m02s)
01:20:02

[model to kind of keep track of where at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m08s)
01:20:08

[or feed and that helps the trading now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m11s)
01:20:11

[there's nothing wrong with training that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m14s)
01:20:14

[way but we can't use that at inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[time at test time but because you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[know the correct answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m24s)
01:20:24

[so Mike Harris model here is totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m27s)
01:20:27

[cheating right I'm passing in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m34s)
01:20:34

[previous letters correct answer to every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m37s)
01:20:37

[set but in real life I don't know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m39s)
01:20:39

[so what we actually need to do is to an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m42s)
01:20:42

[inference time you don't use teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m48s)
01:20:48

[forcing but instead you take the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m51s)
01:20:51

[predicted previous tense result and feed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m53s)
01:20:53

[it in for the next step but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h20m57s)
01:20:57

[I have no idea how to do that in Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m03s)
01:21:03

[like it drove me crazy trying to figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m04s)
01:21:04

[out how to do that in terror and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m07s)
01:21:07

[was the thing that pushed me to high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m10s)
01:21:10

[polish right is they just I was so sick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m12s)
01:21:12

[of these goddamn attention player the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m16s)
01:21:16

[idea of like going back and sort of put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m19s)
01:21:19

[this thing in drove me crazy and I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m20s)
01:21:20

[even know how to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m22s)
01:21:22

[furthermore we actually want this to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m23s)
01:21:23

[dynamic it turns out the best way if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m27s)
01:21:27

[use teacher forcing the whole time you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[actually end up with a model that gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m33s)
01:21:33

[like sloppy it like it learns to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m35s)
01:21:35

[advantage of the fact that it's about to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m38s)
01:21:38

[be told what the previous thing should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m41s)
01:21:41

[have been so it kind of uses a more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m43s)
01:21:43

[speculative approach right so actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m44s)
01:21:44

[the best training approaches as it goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m47s)
01:21:47

[through the epochs initially it is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m50s)
01:21:50

[teacher forcing every time and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m52s)
01:21:52

[halfway through it uses teacher for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m55s)
01:21:55

[theme randomly half the time and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h21m57s)
01:21:57

[the RC it doesn't use teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m00s)
01:22:00

[hosting at all right so kind of learns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m01s)
01:22:01

[to wean itself off this extra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m03s)
01:22:03

[information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m07s)
01:22:07

[and that kind of dynamic thing except](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m09s)
01:22:09

[this really hard or maybe even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m11s)
01:22:11

[impossible to do in serra so for all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[these reasons I moved to the play torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m16s)
01:22:16

[okay I haven't done all of these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m19s)
01:22:19

[in parks which I've done most of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m23s)
01:22:23

[but like the dynamic changing a teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m25s)
01:22:25

[for thing I've actually left to one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m28s)
01:22:28

[you guys to try out anyway the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m30s)
01:22:30

[ideas right here so let's look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m32s)
01:22:32

[plight watch version interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m34s)
01:22:34

[windpipe watch version in terms of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m36s)
01:22:36

[the attention model itself turns out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m38s)
01:22:38

[be way easier but we have to write more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m40s)
01:22:40

[code because there's less structure for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m44s)
01:22:44

[NLP models like the computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m47s)
01:22:47

[stuff there's a place for vision project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m50s)
01:22:50

[which has all that loading and models of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m52s)
01:22:52

[blah blah blah we don't seem to happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m56s)
01:22:56

[NLP kind of version of that so there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h22m58s)
01:22:58

[bit more code to write here anyway so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m01s)
01:23:01

[let's translate English to French and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m04s)
01:23:04

[what I did was I downloaded this there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m08s)
01:23:08

[Giga French corpus which I'll put a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m13s)
01:23:13

[to on the wiki basically this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m17s)
01:23:17

[really cool idea what this researcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m20s)
01:23:20

[did was he went to lots of Canadian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m22s)
01:23:22

[websites and and use the screen scraper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m24s)
01:23:24

[to figure out whether there was a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m27s)
01:23:27

[button saying switch from English to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m29s)
01:23:29

[French and the screen space it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m30s)
01:23:30

[automatically click the button and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m32s)
01:23:32

[assume that those are two screens were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m34s)
01:23:34

[the same right and then he tokenizing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m37s)
01:23:37

[two sentences and provides this corpus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m40s)
01:23:40

[of like a billion words so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m42s)
01:23:42

[pretty great I didn't really want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m47s)
01:23:47

[create like a complete English French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m52s)
01:23:52

[translator because I just didn't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m55s)
01:23:55

[the time to run it for long enough so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m57s)
01:23:57

[try to think okay what's like a an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h23m58s)
01:23:58

[interesting subset of English to French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m00s)
01:24:00

[so I thought okay what if we learn to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m02s)
01:24:02

[translate English questions that start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m04s)
01:24:04

[with WH so right through where Y right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m08s)
01:24:08

[you know and so when I looked at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m12s)
01:24:12

[it turns out that that words yes and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m15s)
01:24:15

[that was something you know veterans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[like eighty thousand or there's a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m22s)
01:24:22

[sentences basically that the nice thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m26s)
01:24:26

[is that all of those sentences are you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m27s)
01:24:27

[know have a somewhat similar structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m30s)
01:24:30

[so it's like if we're going to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m32s)
01:24:32

[everything about translating English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m35s)
01:24:35

[into French that we're going to be doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m36s)
01:24:36

[it with a slight subset so that's why I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m38s)
01:24:38

[did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m40s)
01:24:40

[read check which says okay look the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m41s)
01:24:41

[things that start with WH and then with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m43s)
01:24:43

[a creditor mark keen English and where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m46s)
01:24:46

[the French can be anything at all but it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m50s)
01:24:50

[should end with a question mark okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m52s)
01:24:52

[I went through the French and English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h24m56s)
01:24:56

[files this is really cool trick we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m03s)
01:25:03

[mentioned once before that once you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m07s)
01:25:07

[open in pipes and that returns a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m08s)
01:25:08

[generator that you can look through and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m10s)
01:25:10

[so if use if the tree together you put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m12s)
01:25:12

[the English questions and offensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m14s)
01:25:14

[questions and then just go through and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m15s)
01:25:15

[run the regex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m19s)
01:25:19

[and then return the ones that both of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m22s)
01:25:22

[the regex kamesh okay so here's some is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m26s)
01:25:26

[offensive stance so it's good and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m29s)
01:25:29

[they can see a lot of them are really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m33s)
01:25:33

[simple and you know some of them are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m34s)
01:25:34

[more complex if the usual jump that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m39s)
01:25:39

[people file so we promoted increase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m42s)
01:25:42

[another alright so we've got the English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m44s)
01:25:44

[question to the French press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m47s)
01:25:47

[and I will show you all the steps to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m50s)
01:25:50

[real-world NLP so you can like to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m52s)
01:25:52

[all the pieces we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m54s)
01:25:54

[everything by hand so you can get attend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m55s)
01:25:55

[to the class see what happens so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h25m58s)
01:25:58

[next step is tokenization so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m00s)
01:26:00

[tokenization is taking in a sentence and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m02s)
01:26:02

[turning it into a number or basically in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m05s)
01:26:05

[two words but this is not quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m08s)
01:26:08

[straightforward because like what's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m11s)
01:26:11

[word right so is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m12s)
01:26:12

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m16s)
01:26:16

[is that a word okay or is that a word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m17s)
01:26:17

[or is better word okay and so you know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m21s)
01:26:21

[had to make some decisions based on my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m26s)
01:26:26

[view of what was likely to work and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m28s)
01:26:28

[which especially is like okay I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m30s)
01:26:30

[that's a word and so I just wrote so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m31s)
01:26:31

[regular expressions right for doing kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m36s)
01:26:36

[of heuristic tokenization now you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[use NLP K the national language toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m42s)
01:26:42

[that has a bunch of tokenizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m46s)
01:26:46

[in honestly though I actually found my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m47s)
01:26:47

[hockey rules best techno sir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m52s)
01:26:52

[like I was happier with it than any of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m54s)
01:26:54

[the energy that they took notice I trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m57s)
01:26:57

[for this problem so you can see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h26m58s)
01:26:58

[basically for example if you have any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m01s)
01:27:01

[letter followed by apostrophe s correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m06s)
01:27:06

[then I want you to make the apostrophe s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m09s)
01:27:09

[a word right because it's kind of more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m10s)
01:27:10

[like odd than anything else or else if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m13s)
01:27:13

[it's a letter followed by an apostrophe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m16s)
01:27:16

[followed by a letter that's probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m19s)
01:27:19

[French in which case everything has to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m21s)
01:27:21

[the apostrophe is one word and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m24s)
01:27:24

[everything after it is another work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m25s)
01:27:25

[right so you can basically see it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m27s)
01:27:27

[I'm tokenize the French curve s curve ba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m28s)
01:27:28

[boom ba okay that is exactly what I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m33s)
01:27:33

[and here's English right and so then let](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m38s)
01:27:38

[the test a very accurate statement like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m41s)
01:27:41

[Rachel's baby his tutors and others is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m43s)
01:27:43

[and you can see here the apostrophe s's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m45s)
01:27:45

[okay doing the right thing first to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m47s)
01:27:47

[atrocity little okay so check out my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m50s)
01:27:50

[tokenizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m52s)
01:27:52

[or looks good with that statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m53s)
01:27:53

[directions baby as well so all good so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m56s)
01:27:56

[now that we've got that tokenizing we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h27m59s)
01:27:59

[can go ahead and like do the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m02s)
01:28:02

[thing that we do every time we work with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m03s)
01:28:03

[an LP which is to turn our visitors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m05s)
01:28:05

[words and promises numbers okay we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m07s)
01:28:07

[always do the same way basically create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m09s)
01:28:09

[a vocabulary for the olive bottle words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m12s)
01:28:12

[and health and there's here some insert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m14s)
01:28:14

[padding character and insert the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m18s)
01:28:18

[of a stream character this is like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m21s)
01:28:21

[asterisk in the previous one so create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m22s)
01:28:22

[the reverse mapping from words yd by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m27s)
01:28:27

[using this little enumerate tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m29s)
01:28:29

[and then go through every sentence and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m31s)
01:28:31

[turn it into a list of tokens I call in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m34s)
01:28:34

[math dictionary and you have a question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m36s)
01:28:36

[for motivation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m39s)
01:28:39

[you need a stammer before you and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m42s)
01:28:42

[into numbers no no not at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m45s)
01:28:45

[we different words for different things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m47s)
01:28:47

[about different words you have different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m54s)
01:28:54

[translations so we want to keep them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m56s)
01:28:56

[that healthy you know the tokenizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h28m59s)
01:28:59

[really is just too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m02s)
01:29:02

[is to do something that we think we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m05s)
01:29:05

[do in a purely rule-based way the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m06s)
01:29:06

[question of like how do we deal with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m08s)
01:29:08

[morphological differences is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m10s)
01:29:10

[highly complex there is like my language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m12s)
01:29:12

[you want to learn it in New York all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m14s)
01:29:14

[right so this is going to end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m17s)
01:29:17

[returning the list of ID's for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m19s)
01:29:19

[sentence the vocabulary the reversal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m23s)
01:29:23

[temporary and just a frequency count for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m26s)
01:29:26

[the Ojeda room great next step is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m29s)
01:29:29

[turn these words into work vectors so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m34s)
01:29:34

[earlier on we used word to back because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m39s)
01:29:39

[word Tyvek has these like multi word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m41s)
01:29:41

[things but for translation I don't want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m43s)
01:29:43

[more solidity so a single word is so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m46s)
01:29:46

[that's why I'm going to use love so go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m48s)
01:29:48

[ahead and turn that into a dictionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m51s)
01:29:51

[from the word to the work vector also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m53s)
01:29:53

[grab some French word vectors found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h29m57s)
01:29:57

[those represent active site that's got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m00s)
01:30:00

[some nice French word Lexus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m02s)
01:30:02

[and so now go ahead and build little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m06s)
01:30:06

[things that can go through my vocabulary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m08s)
01:30:08

[create a big array of zeros and then go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m11s)
01:30:11

[ahead and fill in all of those zeros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m15s)
01:30:15

[with word vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m16s)
01:30:16

[if you can of course sometimes you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m19s)
01:30:19

[up a word and it's not in your word work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m22s)
01:30:22

[that work word vector list in which case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m23s)
01:30:23

[you can just stick a random badger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m26s)

[done many many fun in there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m30s)

[I also am keeping track of how often I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m35s)
01:30:35

[find the word just make sure and for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m38s)
01:30:38

[English out of 19,000 in the vocab we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m40s)

[find 17 point mm work vectors in love so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m43s)
01:30:43

[this is something pretty good so most of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m47s)
01:30:47

[our work vectors are being found and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m49s)
01:30:49

[French a little bit less that you're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m51s)
01:30:51

[bad at properly because of my particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m53s)
01:30:53

[tokenization strategy might have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m56s)
01:30:56

[different with tech motivational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h30m59s)

[in fact letting us know the phone okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h31m17s)
01:31:17

[now that of course the other thing we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h31m23s)
01:31:23

[have to do with NLP is to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h31m24s)

[people they are trying to use pipes what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h31m41s)
01:31:41

[the heck it doesn't have a sequences or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h31m43s)

[of the data the trailer the test and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h31m52s)
01:31:52

[here we have it right so 47,000 train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h31m56s)
01:31:56

[5,000 tests and here's an example of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m03s)
01:32:03

01:32:08

[all the pen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m11s)
01:32:11

[so we can now have to do all the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m14s)
01:32:14

[loading stuff outdoors right so I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m18s)
01:32:18

[gone ahead and created a get batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m19s)

01:32:22

[return a random permutation of when X so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m26s)
01:32:26

[when X is the length of all of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m34s)
01:32:34

[senses so this is going to return and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m37s)
01:32:37

[then grab the first batch size of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m40s)
01:32:40

[this will return 16 random numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m41s)
01:32:41

[between 0 and 47,000 and 97 and so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m44s)
01:32:44

[I can just return those for English and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m49s)
01:32:49

[little French so it's okay if you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m52s)
01:32:52

[have a data loader right this is all it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m55s)
01:32:55

[actually takes to create a basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m57s)
01:32:57

[generator and this is basically doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h32m58s)
01:32:58

[the same thing as a generator if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m01s)
01:33:01

[don't need any data organization and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m04s)
01:33:04

[again you know here's a piece of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m08s)
01:33:08

[you can still write you need a generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m09s)
01:33:09

[inside torch is this a generator if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m12s)
01:33:12

[push past it in your data and your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m15s)
01:33:15

[labels in your batch size a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m18s)
01:33:18

[portion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m20s)
01:33:20

[I'm about to reach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m20s)
01:33:20

[all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m24s)
01:33:24

[Shadis I mentioned last time that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m31s)
01:33:31

[created broadcasting functions for pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m36s)
01:33:36

[torch and that you can see what has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m40s)
01:33:40

[happened was I had all this chaos code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m42s)
01:33:42

[that worked and I want to support its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m45s)
01:33:45

[high polish and PI torch doesn't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m47s)
01:33:47

[broadcasting so none of this stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m50s)
01:33:50

[worked and like so my paid torch was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m52s)
01:33:52

[like way more complex than my own terror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m54s)
01:33:54

[because there was not tweezing done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m56s)
01:33:56

[squeeze your buttocks and everywhere so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h33m58s)
01:33:58

[I wrote add subtract multiply divide and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m01s)
01:34:01

[dot such that they'd have the exact same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m10s)
01:34:10

[broadcasting phonetic cetera this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m13s)
01:34:13

[actually pretty interesting and I really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m18s)
01:34:18

[wish I had time to show you that maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m19s)
01:34:19

[you can have a look visitor in the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m21s)
01:34:21

[and ask questions on the forum because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[it's a little code right so the amount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m24s)
01:34:24

[of code to make all of that work is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[basically that and then it's incredibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m30s)
01:34:30

[little code but importantly I also want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m36s)
01:34:36

[to show you how I build this time I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m39s)
01:34:39

[always use test-driven development for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m40s)
01:34:40

[this kind of thing so basically I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m43s)
01:34:43

[created a whole bunch of matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m44s)
01:34:44

[sectors three-dimensional senses and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m47s)
01:34:47

[four-dimensional senses transposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m49s)
01:34:49

[versions of them wrote something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m52s)
01:34:52

[checks the two things are the same and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m54s)
01:34:54

[then I just go ahead went ahead and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m57s)
01:34:57

[tried making sure that all of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h34m59s)
01:34:59

[things ought to be the same as all these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m02s)
01:35:02

[other things and first of all I wrote it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m04s)
01:35:04

[you know all the tests and then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m07s)
01:35:07

[gradually went through and putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m10s)
01:35:10

[clothes to the test started the pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m12s)
01:35:12

[and then I went back and kept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m15s)
01:35:15

[refactoring the code into another super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m18s)
01:35:18

[and similar so you can see in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m20s)
01:35:20

[you don't all of multiple functions at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m22s)
01:35:22

[most and small and what this meant was I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m25s)
01:35:25

[could now write an attention model using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m27s)
01:35:27

[almost exactly the same notation as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m30s)
01:35:30

[before you know so that was how I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m33s)
01:35:33

[created these broad customer roads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m37s)
01:35:37

[okay so given the David here is a non](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m40s)
01:35:40

[attention encoder and so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m46s)
01:35:46

[basically all it is is create some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m51s)
01:35:51

[embeddings create a groove and then in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h35m54s)
01:35:54

[the forward pass run the embedding and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m00s)
01:36:00

[then run the crew on there okay and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m03s)
01:36:03

[pi torch a grew you can you don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m06s)
01:36:06

[to actually write three crews next to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m10s)
01:36:10

[each other you can just see number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m13s)
01:36:13

[players equals and that's going to set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m14s)
01:36:14

[the crews on top of each other okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m17s)
01:36:17

[that's that i'm pretty straightforward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m21s)
01:36:21

[the decoder is also pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m26s)
01:36:26

[straightforward again create the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m30s)
01:36:30

[embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m33s)
01:36:33

[groove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m35s)
01:36:35

[okay for the decoder we also need a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m37s)
01:36:37

[linear layer at the end and care us to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m39s)
01:36:39

[this dense layer which is the correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m41s)
01:36:41

[size for our output vocabulary right we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m43s)
01:36:43

[actually have to remember to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m46s)
01:36:46

[inference time we don't just want the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m48s)
01:36:48

[stake we actually want to get out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m50s)
01:36:50

[something that we can let do an argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m51s)
01:36:51

[on defined out like which word as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m53s)
01:36:53

[just can say do this into so we needed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m56s)
01:36:56

[this layer eternity to the correct size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h36m58s)
01:36:58

[actually for the French vocabulary close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m01s)
01:37:01

[so the forward parts here is a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m05s)
01:37:05

[different as you'll see when we get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m09s)
01:37:09

[where we actually use this this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m10s)
01:37:10

[actually just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m12s)
01:37:12

[a single step and so this is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m15s)
01:37:15

[just you doing one letter at a time as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m23s)
01:37:23

[you'll see when we get here and here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m26s)
01:37:26

[the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m29s)
01:37:29

[softmax on the fence layer that we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m29s)
01:37:29

[created ptosis embedding grew dense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m33s)
01:37:33

[layer soft matters okay and we returned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m36s)
01:37:36

[both the new hidden state if she'll be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m41s)
01:37:41

[using some for the next step as well as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m44s)
01:37:44

[the actual results of the output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m47s)
01:37:47

[friends that's all fun so here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m52s)
01:37:52

[attention decoder and as you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m54s)
01:37:54

[resonating a hundred lines of code it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m57s)
01:37:57

[a screen on my arm okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h37m59s)
01:37:59

[and the nice thing is this is all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m04s)
01:38:04

[basically the same as carrots right my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m07s)
01:38:07

[w123 my b2 tree movi my brew right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m11s)
01:38:11

[then my final output um and then this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m16s)
01:38:16

[basically all the same as carrots as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m22s)
01:38:22

[well right so I've got my life dodging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m23s)
01:38:23

[add and multiply sauce max is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m27s)
01:38:27

[weighted sum is that catch it's a w3 ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m32s)
01:38:32

01:38:39

[Huffman's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m45s)
01:38:45

[again we both return the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m48s)
01:38:48

[and actual predictions as well as they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m52s)
01:38:52

[face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m54s)
01:38:54

[now the thing is we have to write our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h38m56s)
01:38:56

[own training okay this is high polish so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m02s)
01:39:02

[we're going to have to go ahead and do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m07s)
01:39:07

[bit more work here so basically here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m09s)
01:39:09

[the code that trains in epoch okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m12s)
01:39:12

[create an optimizer for the encoder and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m16s)
01:39:16

[optimize of the decoder the criterion is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m18s)
01:39:18

[you know what they call the the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m22s)
01:39:22

[function negative likelihood percentage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m24s)
01:39:24

[cross-entropy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m26s)
01:39:26

[here's that get batch function we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m28s)
01:39:28

[created ourselves earlier to grab one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m30s)
01:39:30

[batch of French in English put them onto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m32s)
01:39:32

[the GPU and then call crane some of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m35s)
01:39:35

[at the moment keep check out the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m38s)
01:39:38

[and say the time cringe at a loss so all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m40s)
01:39:40

[the works actually had in train which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m44s)
01:39:44

[here like you should these things that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m48s)
01:39:48

[left in the screen of code from Julian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m50s)
01:39:50

[on we had to write it ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m52s)
01:39:52

[so encode our decoder an encoder and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h39m54s)
01:39:54

[remember with PI torch you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m02s)
01:40:02

[manually call zero bread perhaps you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m04s)
01:40:04

[have to zero out the gradient at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m06s)
01:40:06

[side of your training loop and then go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m08s)
01:40:08

[through each word in your target we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m11s)
01:40:11

[already in codebook and call the decoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m18s)
01:40:18

[cutting in the decoder input the hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m20s)
01:40:20

[state and the encoded output and so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m24s)
01:40:24

[next to each other important comes out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m30s)
01:40:30

[there key check the loss and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m32s)
01:40:32

[have to call drop backward manually we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m36s)
01:40:36

[have to call the optimizer set manually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m39s)
01:40:39

[returner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m42s)
01:40:42

[so it's not very interesting code and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m43s)
01:40:43

[it's a kind of stuff which has two specs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m46s)
01:40:46

[you know hopefully the pipes watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m48s)
01:40:48

[community emitting some of us will all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m50s)
01:40:50

[be able to contribute to getting rid of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m52s)
01:40:52

[all this boilerplate kind of code kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m54s)
01:40:54

[of care us so over time I'm sure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h40m57s)
01:40:57

[will happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m00s)
01:41:00

[anyways but now there's the code now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m02s)
01:41:02

[that it's there we can create our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m05s)
01:41:05

[encoder we can create our attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m07s)
01:41:07

[decoder we can train it for a while and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m09s)
01:41:09

[then we can test it now potassium I need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m13s)
01:41:13

[another function for X I want to turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m17s)
01:41:17

[off teacher 14 right so you'll see in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m19s)
01:41:19

[this function this is not very well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m21s)
01:41:21

[reflected and copy to encourage the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m24s)
01:41:24

[effort to get basically a end code and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m26s)
01:41:26

[then I go through my target length for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m28s)
01:41:28

[the decoder that look here I now take my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m32s)
01:41:32

[decoder output and find the top one this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m36s)
01:41:36

[is basically I've maxed that's insane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m40s)
01:41:40

[okay what what word is we predict so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m42s)
01:41:42

[we're not using teacher frosting what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m46s)
01:41:46

[I'm saying what was the actual word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m47s)
01:41:47

[because that'd be cheating we're saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m49s)
01:41:49

[what words we predict right so that now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m52s)
01:41:52

[becomes the input to the next loop right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m56s)
01:41:56

[so this is how we've turned off teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h41m59s)
01:41:59

[14 so there are kind of exercise for one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m02s)
01:42:02

[or more of you guys this week if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m06s)
01:42:06

[interested is to do the thing I told you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m08s)
01:42:08

[earlier which is to kind of combine this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m10s)
01:42:10

[with the training loop and make the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m13s)
01:42:13

[training loop as it goes through the eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m15s)
01:42:15

[box gradually move from always using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m17s)
01:42:17

[teacher 14 to over time randomly using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m21s)
01:42:21

[it less and less and less and come up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m25s)
01:42:25

[the very end it never used the texture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m27s)
01:42:27

[forcing and always uses this if you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m29s)
01:42:29

[that working it's just what's active](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m31s)
01:42:31

[long I think it's pretty straightforward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m34s)
01:42:34

[you'll get better test results what I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m35s)
01:42:35

[showing you here okay anyway let's test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m39s)
01:42:39

[it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m42s)
01:42:42

[so to approach to English we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m43s)
01:42:43

[basically going to take our French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m46s)
01:42:46

[sentence turn it into a list of ID's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m48s)
01:42:48

[like tokenizing X and things like these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m51s)
01:42:51

[adding up the zeros all that evaluates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m54s)
01:42:54

[function I just showed you and then join](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h42m57s)
01:42:57

[it together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m00s)
01:43:00

[there it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m02s)
01:43:02

[so this was the correct English this was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m05s)
01:43:05

[the French we were given and this was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m09s)
01:43:09

[our prediction so you know it's not the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m11s)
01:43:11

[same but it's still correct you know as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m14s)
01:43:14

[a seeker so that's looking pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m19s)
01:43:19

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m22s)
01:43:22

[there it is there's translation um I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m26s)
01:43:26

[guess there's a couple of things I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m29s)
01:43:29

[wanted to briefly mention one is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m31s)
01:43:31

[literal stuff that you guys complain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m34s)
01:43:34

[with a fugitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m37s)
01:43:37

[this decoding loop there's much better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m39s)
01:43:39

[ways to do it but what I'm doing here by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m43s)
01:43:43

[taking the top one every time is I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m47s)
01:43:47

[assuming in the decoder that the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m51s)
01:43:51

[prediction is the correct one but what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m55s)
01:43:55

[is like two words for a nearly 50 CV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h43m58s)
01:43:58

[that is a 51% is one 49% and I go are 72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m01s)
01:44:01

[51 percent that might be a bad idea and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m05s)
01:44:05

[and so I'm going to actually feel some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m08s)

[what you could do instead so he's doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m23s)
01:44:23

[something slightly different which is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m29s)
01:44:29

[say what if we had a sentence like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m32s)

01:44:40

[out not how to translate it but to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m43s)
01:44:43

[figure out what part of speech each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m45s)

[she is adjectives CBS verb left bracket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m55s)
01:44:55

[right great so the correct answer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h44m58s)
01:44:58

[that natural isn't adjectives and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m01s)
01:45:01

[languages are now on and processing of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m04s)
01:45:04

[now in circle this would be the correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m06s)
01:45:06

[path through these options now how would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m08s)

[you create this time well you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m14s)
01:45:14

[start out by figuring out how likely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m20s)
01:45:20

[natural is in language in general to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m25s)
01:45:25

[a noun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m29s)
01:45:29

[versus an adjective this is the verb and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m29s)
01:45:29

[so forth and then having done that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m31s)
01:45:31

[every single one of those you can figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m34s)
01:45:34

[out how likely it is stretch one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m36s)
01:45:36

[these two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m39s)
01:45:39

[then be a noun and then to be an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m39s)
01:45:39

[adjective in the river and so forth and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m42s)
01:45:42

[if you keep repeating this process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m44s)
01:45:44

[adding up the log predictions all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m46s)
01:45:46

[way along all the way to the end and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m49s)
01:45:49

[pick the path with truth the best now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m52s)
01:45:52

[the problem is of course is that that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m56s)
01:45:56

[basically five times five times five to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h45m58s)
01:45:58

[see if you really have five choices you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h46m01s)
01:46:01

[know exponentially combos and remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h46m02s)
01:46:02

[in our case we're not picking from five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h46m06s)
01:46:06

[it's probably not a right bracket right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h46m52s)
01:46:52

[it might be one of these okay well let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h46m55s)

01:47:49

[do you know if there are any training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h47m53s)

[is the population of Canada and what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h47m57s)
01:47:57

[Canada's population are very nearly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m00s)
01:48:00

[same I thought but I'm not sure these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m02s)
01:48:02

[matters because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m05s)
01:48:05

[on average you know you're you know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m09s)
01:48:09

[better system will be one which you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m12s)

[translate so just a tiny the one versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m15s)

[the other like the best the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m18s)

01:48:21

[going to varies depending on the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m23s)
01:48:23

[to that question so I'm not sure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m24s)
01:48:24

[it's that important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m26s)

[MNM could we translate between Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m27s)

[and English you doesn't say method yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m30s)
01:48:30

[we can but it would be better if we use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h48m32s)

[before or more generally you know maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h49m23s)

[not the huge embedding make sure it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h49m29s)

[time is going to be hard to train so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h49m32s)

[what do you do and so the answer is you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h49m35s)
01:49:35

[use something called the p/e which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h49m39s)
01:49:39

[it's basically an encoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h49m47s)
01:49:47

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h49m50s)

[and what it's going to do is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h49m52s)
01:49:52

[take attention like hello I am Jeremy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h49m54s)

[all done come on and it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m04s)
01:50:04

[basically say okay I'm going to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m06s)
01:50:06

[turn this into a list of tokens that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m09s)
01:50:09

[aren't necessarily the same as the words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m11s)
01:50:11

[and so the first I'm going to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m14s)
01:50:14

[going to look at every pair of whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m15s)
01:50:15

[h-e-l-l-o and so forth to my whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m18s)
01:50:18

[training set I'm going to say which pair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m21s)
01:50:21

[of letters is the most time and so maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m24s)
01:50:24

[the answer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m27s)
01:50:27

[pyaare okay so I take those two and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m33s)
01:50:33

[turn them into a so we start off with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m39s)
01:50:39

[like every character separate so we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m42s)
01:50:42

[how to combine these into a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m44s)
01:50:44

[entity court er right and then I go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m46s)
01:50:46

[through when I do that again and maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m50s)
01:50:50

[the next answer is that actually a.m.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m52s)
01:50:52

[appears a lot so they're not going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m55s)
01:50:55

[take that turned that into a m and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h50m57s)
01:50:57

[maybe the next thing is actually any are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m01s)
01:51:01

[a is the next most common thing editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m03s)
01:51:03

[fine so now we check this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m06s)
01:51:06

[and replace it with the re](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m09s)
01:51:09

[and it kick Terenas but you never cross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m13s)
01:51:13

[word boundaries so so in theory we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m16s)
01:51:16

[do this forever until we end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m19s)
01:51:19

[eventually with the words again but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m21s)
01:51:21

[instead what happens with this vpa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m24s)
01:51:24

[encoder is you provide a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m26s)
01:51:26

[parameter which is what is the maximum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m28s)
01:51:28

[number of combiners you want to do like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m31s)
01:51:31

[a common default below 10,000 so at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m34s)
01:51:34

[end of that you're going to end up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m36s)
01:51:36

[like 10,000 sub word sequences so both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m38s)
01:51:38

[will end up like churning this sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m44s)
01:51:44

[in something like HCl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m46s)
01:51:46

[hello and then there's a special end of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m50s)
01:51:50

[word States I fix and a mythical B then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h51m54s)
01:51:54

[B like J and then ER e and then my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m01s)
01:52:01

[something like that right now the cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m06s)
01:52:06

[thing is that you can do this by going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m09s)
01:52:09

[through this github site and downloading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m18s)

[the exact same thing but it's got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m32s)
01:52:32

[little sick an app app space between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m35s)
01:52:35

[every one of these be PE codes but so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m38s)
01:52:38

[other words to use this with what I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m41s)
01:52:41

[showed you you don't have to write any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m45s)

[and it will spit out you know be PE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h52m53s)

[that you know I think maybe the optimal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m02s)
01:53:02

[approach would be to actually write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m05s)

[something which first of all figured out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m08s)
01:53:08

[like which are the most common 20,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m10s)
01:53:10

[words or ten thousand words and lets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m13s)
01:53:13

[those words alone and they only run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m15s)

[there the BCE encoding on the on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m18s)

[thing that's really rare words because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m23s)
01:53:23

[sometimes BCE encoding actually sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m25s)

[important technique and so for Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m33s)
01:53:33

[you know for those of you that speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m36s)
01:53:36

[Chinese you know that it's actually not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m38s)
01:53:38

[at all clear where words to get an end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m41s)
01:53:41

[not only in our spaces but grammatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m42s)
01:53:42

[in Chinese there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m46s)
01:53:46

[well what example would be you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m52s)
01:53:52

[have a sequence of two verbs where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m54s)
01:53:54

[government adjective or Virtanen verb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h53m58s)
01:53:58

[which basically the second verb or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m01s)
01:54:01

[adjective describes the result of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m03s)
01:54:03

[first one and so like we could treat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m05s)
01:54:05

[that as a single word the certainty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m07s)
01:54:07

[result is 2 while you consider the three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m09s)
01:54:09

[words so it'd also be a perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m11s)
01:54:11

[reasonable thing to do and there's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m13s)
01:54:13

[right answer this kind of weird stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m14s)
01:54:14

[happens all the time in Chinese you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m16s)
01:54:16

[insert the character nut into the middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m20s)
01:54:20

[of a 2 a 2 character verb and it turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m23s)
01:54:23

[that into a new word which means that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m28s)
01:54:28

[that theme can't be done just a new word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m29s)
01:54:29

[as in that three words it's very hard to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m32s)
01:54:32

[tell so it's started to use VPN with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m35s)
01:54:35

[Chinese you can kind of tokenize it in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m37s)
01:54:37

[way that's entirely too digital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m41s)
01:54:41

[so I think that'd be the end of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m43s)
01:54:43

[range okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m45s)
01:54:45

[I want to leave translation there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m51s)
01:54:51

[because I desperately wanted to insert a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m53s)
01:54:53

[discussion about segmentation it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h54m59s)
01:54:59

[we've kept including that segmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m02s)
01:55:02

[and I really could have realized in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m03s)
01:55:03

[last week how exciting a particular part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m11s)
01:55:11

[of segmentation has turned out to be and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m15s)
01:55:15

[I really really really wanted to explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m17s)
01:55:17

[it to you before the end of the course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m18s)
01:55:18

[so I'm going to do I'm half of it today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m20s)
01:55:20

[and out of it next week if we can and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m22s)
01:55:22

[let me show you what is exciting so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m27s)
01:55:27

[segmentation is about taking something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m30s)
01:55:30

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m36s)
01:55:36

[like this and turning it into something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m38s)
01:55:38

[like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m42s)
01:55:42

[where every color represents the thin so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m44s)
01:55:44

[it's kind of pink is Road this light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m47s)
01:55:47

[purple is line this blue is footpaths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m50s)
01:55:50

[this purple is car this red is building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m54s)
01:55:54

[an observable okay so this is quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h55m57s)
01:55:57

[challenging thing to do but it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m00s)
01:56:00

[important for anything that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m02s)
01:56:02

[understand the world react to it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m05s)
01:56:05

[clearly robotics and self-driving cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m08s)
01:56:08

[that's what we have to be able to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m09s)
01:56:09

[this very quickly very accurately but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m11s)
01:56:11

[really a whole range of computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m14s)
01:56:14

[problems if you ever do this for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m16s)
01:56:16

[last week we saw that hackathon winning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m22s)
01:56:22

[entry from a couple of our students that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m27s)
01:56:27

[was able to say take this cat and blur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m30s)
01:56:30

[it out or play this style transfer to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m34s)
01:56:34

[this cat or whatever so you need a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m37s)
01:56:37

[of being able to know exactly where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m39s)
01:56:39

[cat is and for something like one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m42s)
01:56:42

[things that showed was remove the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m46s)
01:56:46

[background now you actually need to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m48s)
01:56:48

[able to do a really good job of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m50s)
01:56:50

[segmenting out the cat because if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m51s)
01:56:51

[get it slightly wrong and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m53s)
01:56:53

[remove the background you know you often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m54s)
01:56:54

[see this like when people use Photoshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m58s)
01:56:58

[badly you know you'll end up with like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h56m59s)
01:56:59

[the bit between the ears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m01s)
01:57:01

[see those two there or you know their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m02s)
01:57:02

[fur looks really slightly or something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m05s)
01:57:05

[so if you want to create the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m06s)
01:57:06

[generation Photoshop initiative of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m08s)
01:57:08

[so there's lots of reasons janeshia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m11s)
01:57:11

[goodness now turns out that there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m13s)
01:57:13

[fantastic way of doing this for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m18s)
01:57:18

[fantastic name called the hundred layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m20s)
01:57:20

[tiramisu and 100 layers tiramisu is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m22s)
01:57:22

[fully convolutional denseness and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m26s)
01:57:26

[therefore we're not going to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m28s)
01:57:28

[this yet instead we're going to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m30s)
01:57:30

[the denseness because we can understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m32s)
01:57:32

[the chair issue without identity so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m36s)
01:57:36

[is the paper that introduced the dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m38s)
01:57:38

[man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m40s)
01:57:40

[and it turns out you really really need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m42s)
01:57:42

[to also know about business for other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m47s)
01:57:47

[reasons and let me show you the reason I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m49s)
01:57:49

[totally recently I fully appreciated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m50s)
01:57:50

[this here is the results for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m53s)
01:57:53

[business net and if you look down here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h57m58s)
01:57:58

[you will recognize that it is being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m00s)
01:58:00

[compared to genuinely state-of-the-art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m02s)
01:58:02

[sub okay so network a network highway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m05s)
01:58:05

[network flexible neck ResNet represent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m09s)
01:58:09

[stochastic depth and wide Brezhnev okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m11s)
01:58:11

[these are genuinely state-of-the-art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m14s)
01:58:14

[architectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m16s)
01:58:16

[and it's being looked at on some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m19s)
01:58:19

[carefully studied data sets this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m21s)

[federal organization without classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m28s)
01:58:28

[without that relevant issue so five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m30s)
01:58:30

[higher 100 the previous said at the art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m33s)
01:58:33

[which is late massively well studied was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m37s)
01:58:37

[twenty-eight and that itself was way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m40s)
01:58:40

[above everybody else this paper got my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m43s)

[scene and I'm like you guys have seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m46s)
01:58:46

[enough of these now to know that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m49s)

[don't decrease by 35% we can computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m51s)

[vision nowadays you can see of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m56s)

[Amazon so this is like a huge event now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h58m58s)

[the reason the chooser advanced is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m01s)
01:59:01

[important because specifically these no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m02s)
01:59:02

[data augmentation columns it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m05s)
01:59:05

[offensive so far ten one similar thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m07s)
01:59:07

[I've been down from seven point three to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m10s)

[thirty two tenets eaters as well what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m14s)

[these represents these these without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m18s)
01:59:18

[data augmentation columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m20s)
01:59:20

[they basically represents the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m21s)
01:59:21

[performance of this data set on a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m23s)
01:59:23

[limited amount of data but if you're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m25s)
01:59:25

[using data augmentation you're basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m28s)
01:59:28

[forcing it to have to work with less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m30s)
01:59:30

[hair and like I know that a huge number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m33s)
01:59:33

[of you are wanting to build stuff where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m36s)
01:59:36

[you don't have much data so if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m39s)
01:59:39

[one of those people you definitely need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m41s)
01:59:41

[new Center at this stage since net is by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m43s)
01:59:43

[far the state of the art results or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m47s)
01:59:47

[datasets where you don't have my share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m51s)
01:59:51

[so so I'm going to teach you about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m54s)
01:59:54

[set for two reasons first is for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m56s)
01:59:56

[next week we can learn about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=01h59m58s)
01:59:58

[tiramisu and compliance tiramisu but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m00s)
02:00:00

[also so that we can find out how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m03s)
02:00:03

[create way way way way better computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m06s)
02:00:06

[vision models where you have analogous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m10s)
02:00:10

[data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m11s)
02:00:11

[okay so let's learn how to do this um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m12s)
02:00:12

[and I can actually describe it with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m16s)

[replace edition with concatenations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m25s)
02:00:25

[so that's actually the entirety of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m29s)
02:00:29

[advancement is that understanding that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m33s)
02:00:33

[what it is and why it works is more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m36s)

[involved so let's remind ourselves about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m39s)
02:00:39

[ResNet okay we've looked at this many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m43s)

[times but there's no harm in just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m45s)
02:00:45

[reminding ourselves with ResNet we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m47s)
02:00:47

[some input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m50s)
02:00:50

[input we put it through a convolution to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m55s)
02:00:55

[get some activation and another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h00m58s)
02:00:58

[convolution to get some activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m00s)
02:01:00

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m05s)
02:01:05

[and we also have the identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m06s)
02:01:06

[and this is edition right so basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m13s)
02:01:13

[we end up with our kind of you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m19s)
02:01:19

[layer T plus 1 equals some functions of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m24s)
02:01:24

[the convolution that is of the layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m32s)
02:01:32

[T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m34s)
02:01:34

[plus layer T itself right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m36s)
02:01:36

[remind you what I've normally shown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m41s)
02:01:41

[after that is then to say okay so our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m43s)
02:01:43

[function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m45s)

[fools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h01m50s)
02:01:50

02:01:59

[couldn't find the error so every time we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m01s)
02:02:01

[look at Reds net we read it in this way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m04s)
02:02:04

[okay so what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m06s)
02:02:06

[we do exactly the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m10s)
02:02:10

[we replace that with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m15s)

02:02:21

[and remember this is just one block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m26s)
02:02:26

[right so we've got like blah blah blah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m28s)
02:02:28

[blah blah so what that means is that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m30s)
02:02:30

[know after the first layer we have both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m33s)
02:02:33

[the result of some convolutions and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m36s)
02:02:36

[original input which we like literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m41s)
02:02:41

[copied it in concatenated and then after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m43s)
02:02:43

[the second layer we've got some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m46s)
02:02:46

[convolutions on convolutions and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m49s)
02:02:49

[original first layer of convolution and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m53s)
02:02:53

[the original input at and further book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h02m56s)
02:02:56

[that second layer convolutions was self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m00s)
02:03:00

[operating on this concat so that second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m03s)
02:03:03

[layer convolutions was operating both on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m06s)
02:03:06

[the original data as well as on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m08s)
02:03:08

[outcome of the consider convolutions so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m11s)
02:03:11

[when people draw a dense net they tend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m15s)
02:03:15

[to draw it like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m19s)
02:03:19

[they show like every layer going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m20s)
02:03:20

[every layer after it now I didn't define](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m25s)
02:03:25

[it that way because it's much easier in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m29s)
02:03:29

[practice to implement it other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m31s)
02:03:31

[each layer equals all of the previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m33s)
02:03:33

[layer concatenate it with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m36s)
02:03:36

[convolution on top of the previous layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m39s)
02:03:39

[and so you can catch that recursively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m41s)
02:03:41

[if you always have all of your previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m43s)
02:03:43

[layers there as well okay so sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m47s)
02:03:47

[people get confused when they see this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m49s)
02:03:49

[picture where everything is shown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m52s)
02:03:52

[connecting to each other better you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m54s)
02:03:54

[at the code and it looks like it's only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m56s)
02:03:56

[connected to the previous letter and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h03m58s)
02:03:58

[that's because the previous layer itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m00s)
02:04:00

[were connected to the previous layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m02s)
02:04:02

[which was the previous lesson trees okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m04s)
02:04:04

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m07s)
02:04:07

[because we kick at meeting the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m10s)
02:04:10

[filters is getting bigger and bigger but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m14s)
02:04:14

[so we could have to be careful not to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m19s)
02:04:19

[add too many filters at each letter so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m22s)
02:04:22

[the number of filters that are added in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m26s)
02:04:26

[each layer they call the growth rate and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m30s)
02:04:30

[for some reason they use the letter K is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m35s)
02:04:35

[K for corrosive they tend to use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m40s)
02:04:40

[values of 12 or 24 in the tiramisu paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m47s)
02:04:47

[they tend to use the value of 16 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m52s)
02:04:52

[every layer has 12 more filters in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m56s)
02:04:56

[previous layer and you generally can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h04m59s)
02:04:59

[have like 100 letters and so after 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m02s)
02:05:02

[layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m06s)
02:05:06

[you could have 1200 or 2400 filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m07s)
02:05:07

[which is getting to be fun one yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m11s)
02:05:11

[obviously so interestingly well though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m15s)
02:05:15

[they they kind of add up you actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m22s)
02:05:22

[end up with less parameters to normal so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m25s)
02:05:25

[you can see that this here is 5 5 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m30s)
02:05:30

[even this is a state-of-the-art result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m33s)
02:05:33

[set in the center and this is with only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m35s)
02:05:35

[a million parameters right so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m39s)
02:05:39

[beating Rebs net with 10 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m41s)
02:05:41

[parameters by a third okay this is why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m44s)
02:05:44

[it's working so well with so little data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m48s)
02:05:48

[um I'm not convinced that this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m52s)
02:05:52

[right approach for or is it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h05m56s)
02:05:56

[somatically better approach for imagenet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m01s)
02:06:01

[right this is the picture finish net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m03s)
02:06:03

[some this is the important one the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m07s)
02:06:07

[number of plots so it's another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m09s)
02:06:09

[floating-point operation committed plain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m10s)
02:06:10

[what it takes to your computer Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m13s)
02:06:13

[versus the error rate you can see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m15s)
02:06:15

[fence net and Resnick at about the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m19s)
02:06:19

[error rate and then it's like yeah huh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m22s)
02:06:22

[you know it's about sly precise bit less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m27s)
02:06:27

[so it's you're better but it's not like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m30s)
02:06:30

[magically better and there are actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m32s)
02:06:32

[better architectures than driftnet form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m35s)
02:06:35

[very much net neighbors so so really if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m37s)
02:06:37

[you're using something that's more of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m46s)
02:06:46

[the 100 to 100,000 images range we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m48s)
02:06:48

[probably want to use it as that but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m55s)
02:06:55

[more than a hundred thousand images and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m57s)
02:06:57

[maybe it doesn't matter too much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h06m59s)
02:06:59

[okay so you wanna see the code this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m04s)
02:07:04

[moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m09s)
02:07:09

[so interestingly this turned out to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m10s)
02:07:10

[something that suited carrots really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m13s)
02:07:13

[well the you know this kind of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m15s)
02:07:15

[things where you're using standard kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m19s)
02:07:19

[of layers connected in different ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m22s)
02:07:22

[caris it's fantastically growing for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m25s)
02:07:25

[Italy so I'm going to use size 510 I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m28s)
02:07:28

[just copied and pasted the especially to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m32s)
02:07:32

[the Charis Charis of data set so 510 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m34s)
02:07:34

[there's an example started up in if the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m39s)
02:07:39

[funny of data set is 32 533 pixel images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m42s)
02:07:42

[and so that's what it's like by the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m44s)
02:07:44

[track translation there from lots 255 so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m46s)
02:07:46

[therefore launched 255 I want to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m52s)
02:07:52

[them lots of one joy 511 all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m53s)
02:07:53

[we're going to try to figure out this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h07m57s)
02:07:57

[a truck we have 10 categories and 5 5 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m00s)
02:08:00

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m03s)
02:08:03

[so the less code that you write the less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m05s)
02:08:05

[chance that there is for an arrow all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m11s)
02:08:11

[right so I try to refactor out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m13s)
02:08:13

[everything that happens more than once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m16s)
02:08:16

[and so even a simple thing like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m19s)
02:08:19

[activation really I create a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m20s)
02:08:20

[for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m23s)

[that storm with a particular mode and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m30s)
02:08:30

[access to the function for and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m33s)
02:08:33

[applying radio on top of batch norm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m35s)
02:08:35

[searching for great convolutions are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m37s)
02:08:37

[always have this inert this border mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m43s)
02:08:43

[this LG regularization and this dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m45s)
02:08:45

[so there's a faction ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m49s)
02:08:49

[um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m53s)
02:08:53

[then we have a batch norm then rail un](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h08m57s)
02:08:57

[convolution and dropout so there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m02s)
02:09:02

[function form in the paper they also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m04s)
02:09:04

[have something called a bottleneck layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m07s)
02:09:07

[this is a one by one convolution where I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m08s)
02:09:08

[basically compressed the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m14s)
02:09:14

[filters down into the growth factor fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m18s)
02:09:18

[for right and so this is a way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m24s)
02:09:24

[reducing the dimensionality you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m26s)
02:09:26

[here when they use a bottleneck and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m30s)
02:09:30

[something called compression we'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m33s)
02:09:33

[in a moment they call it dense net BC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m34s)
02:09:34

[and you can see that that reduces the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m36s)
02:09:36

[number of parameters even more and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m39s)
02:09:39

[therefore makes it even more accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m41s)
02:09:41

[right so I'm very speaking you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m44s)
02:09:44

[probably be wanting to use bottleneck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m47s)
02:09:47

[but it's just a one by one cons with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m49s)
02:09:49

[this case 48 filters so it's reducing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m53s)
02:09:53

[the dimensionality through that so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h09m55s)
02:09:55

[basically what happens in is you have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m00s)
02:10:00

[number of dense blocks each sense slot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m07s)
02:10:07

[basically consists of a number of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m10s)
02:10:10

[convolutions followed by concatenation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m16s)
02:10:16

[right so go to each layer convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m20s)
02:10:20

[concatenate and you see how I'm actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m23s)
02:10:23

[replacing X with it right so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m25s)
02:10:25

[concatenated Twitter self again and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m28s)
02:10:28

[again so it's getting longer and longer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m30s)
02:10:30

[okay and then from time to time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m31s)
02:10:31

[um I then add in a transition block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m37s)
02:10:37

[which is simply a one by one convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m40s)
02:10:40

[followed by pulling layer right so just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m44s)
02:10:44

[like every computer visual model we used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m48s)
02:10:48

[to bunch of computation layers and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m50s)
02:10:50

[pull bunch of computation for budget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m54s)
02:10:54

[computation or so this looks like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h10m56s)
02:10:56

[pretty standard kind of architecture oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m00s)
02:11:00

[and the intervention compression the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m06s)
02:11:06

[other thing that is in each transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m09s)
02:11:09

[block you can optionally have this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m10s)
02:11:10

[called compression which normally you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m13s)
02:11:13

[would set us 0.5 that just says okay the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m15s)
02:11:15

[number of filters take however many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m18s)
02:11:18

[filters we currently have and multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m21s)
02:11:21

[by 0.5 so this is basically something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m24s)
02:11:24

[where every time you have a poorly layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m26s)
02:11:26

[you also decrease the number of filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m28s)
02:11:28

[so when you have this bottleneck layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m31s)
02:11:31

[and you have this compression of 0.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m33s)
02:11:33

[that's what dense near busy the first is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m35s)
02:11:35

[yes and can we do transfer learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m39s)
02:11:39

[understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m43s)
02:11:43

[absolutely you can and in fact pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m45s)
02:11:45

[torch Japs came to the Negro 16 up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m50s)
02:11:50

[yesterday or today and has been snatched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m53s)
02:11:53

[creature as some pre-trained festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h11m56s)
02:11:56

[having said that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m00s)
02:12:00

[because the size of the affirmations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m03s)
02:12:03

[continues to increase increase increase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m07s)
02:12:07

[that we again have this problem that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m08s)
02:12:08

[there isn't really a nice kind of small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m12s)
02:12:12

[number of activations that you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m17s)
02:12:17

[really build on top of so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m19s)
02:12:19

[I'm not sure I'm not sure how practical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m22s)
02:12:22

[it would be but you're certainly cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m24s)
02:12:24

[all right so here is the whole Dan Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m27s)
02:12:27

[model basically there's four layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m33s)
02:12:33

[which are part of the dance blocks which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m41s)
02:12:41

[is there's an initial feedback a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m45s)
02:12:45

[convolution there's a global effort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m46s)
02:12:46

[falling layer and there's also a real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m50s)
02:12:50

[innovation on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m51s)
02:12:51

[so if you subtract the four and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m52s)
02:12:52

[divide by the number of tens blocks that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m55s)
02:12:55

[tells you how many layers you need for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m57s)
02:12:57

[every block so you do a three by three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h12m59s)
02:12:59

[khans then we go through each of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m02s)
02:13:02

[lay those layers get a dense block and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m05s)
02:13:05

[for every one except for the last layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m09s)
02:13:09

[we also do a transition block so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m11s)
02:13:11

[when a boolean finally do a batch alarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m13s)
02:13:13

[value global epoch falling and then a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m16s)
02:13:16

[dense layer to create a road under fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m20s)
02:13:20

[so that's basically it if you create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m24s)
02:13:24

[that compile it and fit it so I ran it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m27s)
02:13:27

[last night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m35s)
02:13:35

[and so I couldn't quite run it as long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m36s)
02:13:36

[as they did but I did get to 90 3.33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m38s)
02:13:38

[which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m45s)
02:13:45

[be sort of a set of the artists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m49s)
02:13:49

[somewhere about shift to the bit so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m51s)
02:13:51

[didn't have time to run it as long as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m55s)
02:13:55

[they did but I've certainly replicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m57s)
02:13:57

[their state of the art result as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h13m58s)
02:13:58

[know as you can see using nothing but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m01s)
02:14:01

[basically two screens or sort of scare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m04s)
02:14:04

[us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m07s)
02:14:07

[so I read through that pretty quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m08s)
02:14:08

[but honestly this is all stuff that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m10s)
02:14:10

[guys are pretty familiar with so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m12s)
02:14:12

[read the paper so really easy paper to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m14s)
02:14:14

[read with the code which have an easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m17s)
02:14:17

[code to read if you haven't done much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m19s)
02:14:19

[like implementing papers with code this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m21s)
02:14:21

[is a great place to start because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m25s)
02:14:25

[like there's no mess in the paper pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m26s)
02:14:26

[clear the chaos code is really easy to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m29s)
02:14:29

[read there's no new content so like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m31s)
02:14:31

[would be a great way to get started and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m34s)
02:14:34

[as I fit in other students and I some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m36s)
02:14:36

[the students and I basically started on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m38s)
02:14:38

[this on Friday and I've got it knocked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m40s)
02:14:40

[out so I think this is pretty exciting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m44s)
02:14:44

[alright so 9 o'clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m46s)
02:14:46

[thanks everybody looking forward to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m48s)
02:14:48

[chatting to you in a week close to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m50s)
02:14:50

[and next Monday for our last part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lx2shfA-5s#t=02h14m52s)
02:14:52
