[our penultimate lesson and believe it or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m02s)
00:00:02

[not a couple of weeks ago in Lesson four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m09s)
00:00:09

[I mentioned I was going to share that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m15s)

[researcher Sebastian Reuter which I did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m19s)
00:00:19

[and he he said he loved it and he's gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m22s)
00:00:22

[on to yesterday released this new post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m25s)
00:00:25

[he called optimization for deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m29s)
00:00:29

[highlights in 2017 in which he covered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m31s)
00:00:31

[basically everything that we talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m34s)
00:00:34

[about in that lesson and with some very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m36s)

[nice shout outs to some of the work that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m40s)
00:00:40

[some of the students here have done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m42s)
00:00:42

[including when he talked about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m43s)
00:00:43

[separation of the separation of weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m46s)

[decay from the momentum term and so he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m53s)
00:00:53

[actually mentions here the opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h00m58s)
00:00:58

[in terms of improved kind of software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m01s)
00:01:01

[decoupling this allows and actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m04s)

[actually showing how to implement this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m11s)
00:01:11

[in fast AI so first a eyes code is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m13s)
00:01:13

[actually being used as a bit of a role](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m16s)
00:01:16

[model now he then covers some of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m18s)
00:01:18

[learning rate tuning techniques that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m23s)
00:01:23

[we've talked about and this is the SGD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m25s)
00:01:25

[our schedule it looks a bit different to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m31s)
00:01:31

[what you're used to seeing this is on a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m33s)

[ananza ha is blog post on this topic so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m49s)
00:01:49

[it's great to see that some of the work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m53s)
00:01:53

[from faster our students is already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m55s)

[getting noticed and picked up and shared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h01m58s)
00:01:58

[and this blog post went on to get on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m00s)

[front page of hacker news so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m02s)
00:02:02

[pretty cool and hopefully more and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m06s)
00:02:06

[of this work or be picked up on sisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m09s)
00:02:09

[released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[publicly so last week we were kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m12s)
00:02:12

[doing a deep dive into collaborative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m19s)
00:02:19

[filtering and let's remind ourselves of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m21s)
00:02:21

[kind of what our final model looked like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m27s)
00:02:27

[so in the end we kind of ended up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m34s)
00:02:34

[rebuilding the model that's actually in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m36s)
00:02:36

[the first a a library where we had an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m42s)
00:02:42

[embedding so we had this little get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m47s)
00:02:47

[embedding function that grabbed an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m49s)
00:02:49

[embedding and randomly initialize the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m51s)
00:02:51

[weights for the users and for the items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m54s)
00:02:54

[that's the kind of generic term in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h02m59s)
00:02:59

[case the items are movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m01s)
00:03:01

[and the bias for the users the bias for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m02s)
00:03:02

[the items and we had n factors embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m04s)
00:03:04

[size for each for each one of course the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m09s)
00:03:09

[biases just had a single one and then we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m11s)
00:03:11

[grabbed the users and item in weddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[multiply them together summed it up each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m15s)
00:03:15

[row and add it on the bias terms pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[that through a sigmoid to put it into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[the range that we wanted so that was our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m24s)
00:03:24

[model and one of you asked if we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m27s)
00:03:27

[kind of interpret this information in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m33s)
00:03:33

[some way and I promised this week we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m35s)
00:03:35

[would see how to do that so let's take a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m37s)
00:03:37

[look so we're going to start with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m39s)
00:03:39

[model we built here where we just used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m42s)
00:03:42

[that fast AI library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m44s)
00:03:44

[collaborative data set from CSP and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m46s)
00:03:46

[that get learner and then we fitted it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m49s)
00:03:49

[in three epochs 19 seconds we've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m52s)
00:03:52

[pretty good result so what we can now do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h03m58s)
00:03:58

[is to analyze that model so you may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m02s)
00:04:02

[remember right back when we started we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[read in the movies CSV file but that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m11s)
00:04:11

[just a mapping from the ID of the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m15s)
00:04:15

[to the name of the movie and so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m17s)
00:04:17

[just going to use that for display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m19s)
00:04:19

[purposes so we can see what we're doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m21s)
00:04:21

[because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m24s)
00:04:24

[not all of us have watched every movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m25s)
00:04:25

[I'm just going to limit this to the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[500 most populous or 3,000 most popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m30s)
00:04:30

[movies so we might have more chance of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m33s)
00:04:33

[recognizing the movies we're looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m34s)
00:04:34

[and then I'll go ahead and change it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m36s)
00:04:36

[from the movie IDs from movie lens to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m39s)
00:04:39

[those unique IDs that we're using the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m43s)
00:04:43

[contiguous IDs because that's what a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m46s)
00:04:46

[model has alright so inside the learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m47s)
00:04:47

[object that we create inside alona we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h04m57s)
00:04:57

[can always grab the PI torch model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m00s)
00:05:00

[itself just by saying learn model okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m03s)
00:05:03

[and like I'm going to kind of show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m07s)
00:05:07

[more and more of the code at the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m09s)
00:05:09

[so let's take a look at the definition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m12s)
00:05:12

[of model and so a model is a property so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m14s)
00:05:14

[if you haven't seen a property before a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m20s)
00:05:20

[property is just something in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m21s)
00:05:21

[which looks like a method when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m23s)
00:05:23

[define it that you can call it without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m26s)
00:05:26

[parentheses as we do here alright and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m29s)
00:05:29

[it kind of looks when you call it like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m32s)
00:05:32

[it's a regular attribute but it looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[like when you define it like it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m36s)
00:05:36

[method so every time you call it it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m37s)
00:05:37

[actually runs this code okay and so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m40s)
00:05:40

[this case it's just a shortcut to grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m42s)
00:05:42

[something called dot models model so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m44s)
00:05:44

[may be interested to know what that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m48s)
00:05:48

[looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m49s)
00:05:49

[learn about models and so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m50s)
00:05:50

[there's a fast AI model type is a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m54s)
00:05:54

[thin wrapper for pite watch models so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h05m59s)
00:05:59

[could take a look at this code filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m03s)
00:06:03

[model and see what that is it's only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m06s)
00:06:06

[line of code okay and yeah we'll talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m13s)
00:06:13

[more about these in part two right but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m19s)
00:06:19

[basically that there's this very thin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m21s)
00:06:21

[wrapper and the main thing one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m23s)
00:06:23

[main things that fast i out does is we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m25s)
00:06:25

[have this concept of layer groups where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m26s)
00:06:26

[basically when you say here though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m28s)
00:06:28

[different learning rates and they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m30s)
00:06:30

[going to apply two different sets of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m31s)
00:06:31

[layers and that's something that's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m33s)
00:06:33

[in paid watch so when you say I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m35s)
00:06:35

[use this PI torch model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m36s)
00:06:36

[all this with one thing we have to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m39s)
00:06:39

[which is to say like okay one hour later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m41s)
00:06:41

[groups yeah so the details aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m42s)
00:06:42

[terribly important but in general if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m44s)
00:06:44

[want to create a little wrapper for some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m47s)
00:06:47

[other pipe watch model you could just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m49s)
00:06:49

[write something like this so to get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m51s)
00:06:51

[get inside that to grab the actual PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m56s)
00:06:56

[torch model itself its models dot model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h06m58s)
00:06:58

[that's the PI torch model and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m02s)
00:07:02

[learn object has a shortcut to that okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m04s)
00:07:04

[so we're going to set m to be the PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m07s)
00:07:07

[torch model and so when you print out a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m11s)
00:07:11

[pipe watch model it prints it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m14s)
00:07:14

[basically by listing out all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m16s)
00:07:16

[layers that you created in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m19s)
00:07:19

[constructor it's quite it's quite nifty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m22s)
00:07:22

[actually when you kind of think about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m24s)
00:07:24

[the way this works thanks to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m26s)
00:07:26

[some very handy stuff in Python we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m28s)
00:07:28

[actually able to use standard - oh wow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m32s)
00:07:32

[to kind of define these modules in these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m34s)
00:07:34

[layers and they basically automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m39s)
00:07:39

[kind of register themselves with pipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m41s)
00:07:41

[which so back in our embedding bias we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m44s)
00:07:44

[just had a bunch of things where we said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m48s)
00:07:48

[okay each of these things are equal to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m49s)
00:07:49

[these things and then it automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m52s)
00:07:52

[knows how to represent that so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m54s)
00:07:54

[see there's the name is you and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h07m57s)
00:07:57

[name is just literally whatever we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m00s)
00:08:00

[called it yeah you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m02s)
00:08:02

[and then the definition is it's this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m05s)
00:08:05

[kind of layer okay so that's our height](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[watch model so we can look inside that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m12s)
00:08:12

[basically use that so if we say m dot I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m18s)
00:08:18

[be then that's referring to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m21s)
00:08:21

[embedding layer for an item which is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m24s)
00:08:24

[bias layer so an item bias in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m28s)
00:08:28

[is the movie bias so each move either a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m31s)
00:08:31

[9000 of them has a single bias element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m34s)
00:08:34

[okay now the really nice thing about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m38s)
00:08:38

[high torch layers and models is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m40s)
00:08:40

[they all look the same they basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m45s)
00:08:45

[got to use them you call them as if they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m48s)
00:08:48

[were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[action so we can go m.i.b parenthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[right and that basically says I want you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m54s)
00:08:54

[to return the value of that layer and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h08m57s)
00:08:57

[that layer could be a full-on model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m00s)
00:09:00

[right so to actually get a prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m03s)
00:09:03

[from a play torch model you just I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m06s)
00:09:06

[go m and pass in my variable okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m08s)
00:09:08

[in this case my B and pass in my top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m12s)
00:09:12

[movie indexes now models remember layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m17s)
00:09:17

[they require variables not tensors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m22s)
00:09:22

[because it needs to keep track of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m26s)
00:09:26

[derivatives okay and so we use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m29s)
00:09:29

[capital V to turn the tensor into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m31s)
00:09:31

[variable and was just announced this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m34s)
00:09:34

[week that PI torch 0.4 which is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[version after the one that's just about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m42s)
00:09:42

[to be released is going to get rid of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m44s)
00:09:44

[variables and will actually be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m46s)
00:09:46

[use tensors directly to keep track of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[derivatives so if you're watching this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m51s)
00:09:51

[on the MOOC and you're looking at point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m53s)
00:09:53

[four then you'll probably notice that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m55s)
00:09:55

[the code doesn't have this V unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m57s)
00:09:57

[anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m58s)
00:09:58

[and so that would be pretty exciting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h09m59s)
00:09:59

[when that happens but for now we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m02s)
00:10:02

[remember if we're going to pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m04s)
00:10:04

[something into a model to turn it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m05s)
00:10:05

[variable first and remember a variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m06s)
00:10:06

[has a strict superset of the API of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m09s)
00:10:09

[tensor so anything you can do to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m12s)
00:10:12

[tensor you can do to a variable and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m14s)
00:10:14

[up will take its log or whatever okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m16s)
00:10:16

[that's going to return a variable which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m20s)
00:10:20

[consists of going through each of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m23s)
00:10:23

[movie IDs putting it through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m24s)
00:10:24

[embedding layer to get its bias okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m26s)
00:10:26

[that's going to return a variable let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m30s)
00:10:30

[take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m36s)
00:10:36

[so before I press shift down to here you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m41s)
00:10:41

[can have a think about what I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m46s)
00:10:46

[have I've got a list of 3,000 movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m47s)
00:10:47

[going in turning into variable putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[it through this embedding layer so just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m53s)
00:10:53

[have a think about what we expect to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m55s)
00:10:55

[come out okay and we have a variable of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h10m56s)
00:10:56

[size 3,000 by one hopefully that doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m01s)
00:11:01

[surprise you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m03s)
00:11:03

[we had 3000 movies that we are looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m04s)
00:11:04

[up each one hadn't had a one long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m06s)
00:11:06

[embedding okay so there's our three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m08s)
00:11:08

[thousand one you'll notice it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m11s)
00:11:11

[variable just not surprising because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m12s)
00:11:12

[fed it a variable so we've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m15s)
00:11:15

[variable back and it's a variable that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m16s)
00:11:16

[on the GPU right doc CUDA okay so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m18s)
00:11:18

[have a little shortcut in fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m24s)
00:11:24

[because we we very often when I take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m26s)
00:11:26

[variables turn them into tensors and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m28s)
00:11:28

[move them back to the CPU so we can play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m31s)
00:11:31

[with them more easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m33s)
00:11:33

[so two NP is is two numpy okay and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m33s)
00:11:33

[does all of those things and it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m38s)
00:11:38

[regardless of whether it's a tensor or a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m39s)
00:11:39

[variable it works regardless of whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m41s)
00:11:41

[it's on the CPU or GPU it'll end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m43s)
00:11:43

[giving you a a numpy array from that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m45s)
00:11:45

[okay so if we do that that gives us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m49s)
00:11:49

[exactly the same thing as we just looked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m53s)
00:11:53

[at but now in numpy form okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m54s)
00:11:54

[a super handy thing to use when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h11m58s)
00:11:58

[playing around with pi torch my approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m01s)
00:12:01

[to things is I try to use numpy for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m04s)
00:12:04

[everything except when I explicit and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m09s)
00:12:09

[you need something to run on the GPU or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m12s)
00:12:12

[I need its derivatives right in which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m14s)
00:12:14

[case I use PI torch because like none](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m17s)
00:12:17

[part like I kind of find none PI's often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m19s)
00:12:19

[easier to work with it's been around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m22s)
00:12:22

[many years longer than PI torch so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m24s)
00:12:24

[know and lots of things like the Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m29s)
00:12:29

[imaging library OpenCV and lots and lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[of stuff like pandas it works with numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m35s)
00:12:35

[so my approach is kind of like do as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m39s)
00:12:39

[much as I can in num pile and finally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m41s)
00:12:41

[when I'm ready to do something on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m45s)
00:12:45

[GPU or take its derivative to PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m46s)
00:12:46

[and then as soon as I can I put it back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m49s)
00:12:49

[in vampire and you'll see that the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m51s)
00:12:51

[AI library really works this way like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m53s)
00:12:53

[all the transformations and stuff happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m55s)
00:12:55

[in lamb pie which is different to most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h12m57s)
00:12:57

[high torch computer vision libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m00s)
00:13:00

[which tend to do it all as much as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m03s)
00:13:03

[possible in pi torch I try to do as much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m05s)
00:13:05

[as possible in non pipe so let's say we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m07s)
00:13:07

[wanted to transfer build a model in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m13s)
00:13:13

[GPU with the GPU and train it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[then we want to bring this to production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m17s)
00:13:17

[so would we call to numpy on the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[itself or would we have to iterate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m24s)
00:13:24

[through all the different layers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[then call to NP yeah good question so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m28s)
00:13:28

[it's very likely that you want to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m31s)
00:13:31

[inference on a cpu rather than a GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m33s)
00:13:33

[it's it's more scalable you don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m36s)
00:13:36

[to worry about putting things in batches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m38s)
00:13:38

[you know and so forth so you can move a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m39s)
00:13:39

[model onto the cpu just by typing m dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m44s)
00:13:44

[CPU and that model is now on the cpu and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m48s)
00:13:48

[so therefore you can also then put your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m52s)
00:13:52

[variable on the CPU by doing exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m55s)
00:13:55

[same thing so you can say like so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h13m59s)
00:13:59

[having said that if you're if you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m05s)
00:14:05

[serve it doesn't have a GPU or CUDA GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m08s)
00:14:08

[you don't have to do this because it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m10s)
00:14:10

[won't put it on the GPU at all so if for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m12s)

[running it on you know some t2 instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m19s)
00:14:19

[or something it'll work fine and will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m22s)

[run on the on the cpu automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m24s)
00:14:24

[quick follow-up and if we train the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[model on the GPU and then we save those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m30s)
00:14:30

[embeddings and the weights would we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m33s)
00:14:33

[to do anything special to load you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m37s)
00:14:37

[you won't we have something well it kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[of depends how much of faster I you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m45s)
00:14:45

[using so I'll show you how you can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m46s)
00:14:46

[that in case you have to do it manually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m49s)
00:14:49

[one of the students figure this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m51s)
00:14:51

[which is really handy when we there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h14m54s)
00:14:54

[load model function and you'll see what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m02s)
00:15:02

[it does but it does torch dot load is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[basically this is like some magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m07s)
00:15:07

[incantation that like normally it has to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m09s)
00:15:09

[load it onto the same GPU or saved on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m12s)
00:15:12

[but this will like load it into what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[was what it is available so there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[Andy discovery thanks for the great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m19s)
00:15:19

[questions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m24s)
00:15:24

[to put that back on the GPU I'll need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m28s)
00:15:28

[say doc CUDA and now there we go I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m32s)
00:15:32

[run it again okay so it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m36s)
00:15:36

[important to know about the zip function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m41s)
00:15:41

[in Python which iterates through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m44s)
00:15:44

[number of lists at the same time so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m46s)
00:15:46

[this case I want to grab each movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m50s)
00:15:50

[along with its bias term so that I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m52s)
00:15:52

[just pop it into our list of tuples so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m56s)
00:15:56

[if I just go zip like that that's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h15m58s)
00:15:58

[to iterate through each movie ID and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[each bias term and so then I can use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m02s)
00:16:02

[that in a list comprehension to grab the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m06s)
00:16:06

[name of each movie along with its place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m08s)
00:16:08

[okay so having done that I can then sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m11s)
00:16:11

[and so here are I told you that John](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m16s)
00:16:16

[John Travolta Scientology movie at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m20s)
00:16:20

[most negative of the quiet by a lot if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m24s)
00:16:24

[this was a cable competition Battlefield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m26s)
00:16:26

[Earth would have like won by miles or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m28s)
00:16:28

[this seven seven seven ninety six so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m30s)
00:16:30

[here's the worst movie of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m34s)
00:16:34

[according to IMDB and like it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m36s)
00:16:36

[interesting when you think about what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m39s)
00:16:39

[this means right because this is like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m40s)
00:16:40

[much more authentic way to find out how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m42s)
00:16:42

[bad this movie is because like some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m44s)
00:16:44

[people are just more negative about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m47s)
00:16:47

[movies right and like it more of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m49s)
00:16:49

[watch your movie like you know highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m51s)
00:16:51

[critical audience they're gonna read it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m53s)
00:16:53

[badly so if you take an average it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m55s)
00:16:55

[quite fair right and so what this is you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h16m57s)
00:16:57

[know what this is doing is saying once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m02s)
00:17:02

[we you know remove the fact that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[different people have different overall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m06s)
00:17:06

[positive or negative experiences and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[different people watch different kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m10s)
00:17:10

[of movies and we correct for all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m11s)
00:17:11

[this is the worst movie of all time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m13s)
00:17:13

[that's a good thing to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m17s)
00:17:17

[so this is how we can yeah look inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m21s)
00:17:21

[our our model and and interpret the bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m24s)
00:17:24

[vectors you'll see here I've sorted by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m29s)
00:17:29

[the zeroth element of each tuple by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m33s)
00:17:33

[using a lambda originally I used this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m36s)
00:17:36

[special item ghetto this is part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m39s)
00:17:39

[of pythons operator library and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m42s)
00:17:42

[creates a function that returns the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m45s)
00:17:45

[zeroth element of something in order to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m47s)
00:17:47

[save time and then I actually realize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m50s)
00:17:50

[that the lambda is only one more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m52s)
00:17:52

[character to write then the item get us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m54s)
00:17:54

[so maybe we don't need to know this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m57s)
00:17:57

[after all so yeah really useful to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h17m58s)
00:17:58

[sure you know how to write lambdas in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m01s)
00:18:01

[Python so this is this is a function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m03s)
00:18:03

[okay and so sort the sort is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m06s)
00:18:06

[call this function every time it decides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m09s)
00:18:09

[like is this thing higher or lower than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m11s)
00:18:11

[that other thing and this fact this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[going to return the zeroth element okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m15s)
00:18:15

[so here's the same thing and item get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m19s)
00:18:19

[format and here is the reverse and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m21s)
00:18:21

[Shawshank Redemption right at the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m25s)
00:18:25

[I'll definitely agree with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m27s)
00:18:27

[Godfather usual suspects yeah these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m29s)
00:18:29

[all pretty great movies twelve Angry Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[absolutely so there you go there's how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m35s)
00:18:35

[we can look at the base so then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m39s)
00:18:39

[second piece to look at would be the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m43s)
00:18:43

[embeddings how can we look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m45s)
00:18:45

[embeddings so we can do the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m47s)
00:18:47

[so remember I was the item embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m50s)
00:18:50

[rather than IV with the item bias we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m53s)
00:18:53

[pass in our list of movies as a variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m55s)
00:18:55

[turn it into numpy and here's our movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h18m58s)
00:18:58

[embedding so for each of the 3,000 most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[popular movies here are its 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m04s)
00:19:04

[embeddings so it's very hard unless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m07s)
00:19:07

[you're Geoffrey Hinton to visualize a 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m12s)
00:19:12

[dimensional space so what we'll do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m14s)
00:19:14

[we'll turn it into a three dimensional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m17s)
00:19:17

[space so we can compress high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m19s)
00:19:19

[dimensional spaces down into lower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m23s)
00:19:23

[dimensional spaces using lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m25s)
00:19:25

[different techniques perhaps one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m26s)
00:19:26

[most common and popular is called PCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m29s)
00:19:29

[PCA stands for principle components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m31s)
00:19:31

[analysis it's a linear technique but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[when your techniques generally work fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m38s)
00:19:38

[for this kind of embedding I'm not going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m41s)
00:19:41

[to teach you about PCA now but I will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m44s)
00:19:44

[say in Rachel's computation or linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m46s)
00:19:46

[algebra class which you can get to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m48s)
00:19:48

[from first at AI we cover PCA in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m50s)
00:19:50

[detail and it's a really important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m55s)
00:19:55

[technique it actually it turns out to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m58s)
00:19:58

[almost identical to something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h19m59s)
00:19:59

[singular value decomposition which is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m02s)
00:20:02

[type of matrix decomposition which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[actually does turn up in deep learning a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m06s)
00:20:06

[little bit from time to time it's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m10s)
00:20:10

[of somewhat worth knowing if you were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m13s)
00:20:13

[going to dig more into linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m16s)
00:20:16

[you know SPD and PCA along with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m18s)
00:20:18

[eigenvalues and eigenvectors which are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m22s)
00:20:22

[all slightly different versions is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m24s)
00:20:24

[kind of the same thing or all worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[knowing but for now just know that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[can grab PCA from SK learn to calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m30s)
00:20:30

[position say how much you want to reduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m33s)
00:20:33

[the dimensionality too so I want to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m36s)
00:20:36

[three components and what this is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m39s)
00:20:39

[to do is it's going to find three linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m41s)
00:20:41

[combinations of the 50 dimensions which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m44s)
00:20:44

[capture as much as the variation as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m48s)
00:20:48

[possible Badar is different to each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m50s)
00:20:50

[other as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m52s)
00:20:52

[okay so we would call this a lower rank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m53s)
00:20:53

[approximation of our matrix all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h20m58s)
00:20:58

[so then we can grab the components so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m02s)
00:21:02

[that's going to be their three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[dimensions and so once we've done that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m06s)
00:21:06

[we've now got three by three thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m08s)
00:21:08

[and so we can now take a look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m11s)
00:21:11

[first of them and we'll do the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m15s)
00:21:15

[thing of using zip to look at each one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[along with its movie and so here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m18s)
00:21:18

[thing right we we don't know ahead of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m21s)
00:21:21

[time what this PCA thing is it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m24s)
00:21:24

[it's just a bunch of latent factors you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m28s)
00:21:28

[know it's it's kind of the the main axis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m33s)
00:21:33

[in this space of latent factors and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m37s)
00:21:37

[what we can do is we can look at it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m39s)
00:21:39

[see if we can figure out what it's about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m41s)
00:21:41

[right so given that police academy for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m45s)
00:21:45

[is high up here along with water world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m49s)
00:21:49

[where else Fargo Pulp Fiction and God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m51s)
00:21:51

[further a high up here I'm gonna guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m54s)
00:21:54

[that a high value is not going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h21m57s)
00:21:57

[represent like critically acclaimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m00s)
00:22:00

[movies or serious watching so I kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m02s)
00:22:02

[like all this yeah okay I call this easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m06s)
00:22:06

[what she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m08s)
00:22:08

[is serious all right but like this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m09s)
00:22:09

[kind of how you have to interpret your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m11s)
00:22:11

[embeddings is like take a look at what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[they seem to be showing and decide what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m15s)
00:22:15

[you think it means so this is the kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m18s)
00:22:18

[of the the principal axis in this set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m20s)
00:22:20

[embedding so we can look at the next one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m25s)
00:22:25

[so do the same thing and look at the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m27s)
00:22:27

[first index one embedding this one's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m30s)
00:22:30

[little bit harder to kind of figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m34s)
00:22:34

[what's going on but with things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m35s)
00:22:35

[Mulholland Drive and Purple Rose of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m37s)
00:22:37

[Cairo these look more kind of dialog II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m38s)
00:22:38

[kind of ones or else things like Lord of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m42s)
00:22:42

[the Rings in the Latin and Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m45s)
00:22:45

[these book more like kind of modern CGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m46s)
00:22:46

[II kind of ones so you could kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m48s)
00:22:48

[imagine that on that pair of dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m50s)
00:22:50

[it probably represents a lot of you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m53s)
00:22:53

[differences between how people read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m57s)
00:22:57

[movies you know some people like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h22m59s)
00:22:59

[know purple rise of Cairo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m02s)
00:23:02

[type movies you know Woody Allen kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m05s)
00:23:05

[classic and some people like these you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m09s)
00:23:09

[know big Hollywood spectacles some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m11s)
00:23:11

[people presumably like police academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m15s)
00:23:15

[for more than they like Fargo so yeah so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m17s)
00:23:17

[I'm like you can kind of get the idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m22s)
00:23:22

[what's happened it's it's done a you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m24s)
00:23:24

[know through a model which was you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m26s)
00:23:26

[for a model which was literally multiply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m33s)
00:23:33

[two things together and Adam hop it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m36s)
00:23:36

[learnt quite a lot you know which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m41s)
00:23:41

[kind of cool so that's what we can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m43s)
00:23:43

[with with that and then we could we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m49s)
00:23:49

[could plot them if we wanted to I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m53s)
00:23:53

[grabbed a small subset to plot on those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h23m55s)
00:23:55

[first two asses all right so that's that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m00s)
00:24:00

[so I wanted to next kind of dig in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m04s)
00:24:04

[layer deeper into what actually happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m09s)
00:24:09

[when we say fit alright so when we said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m12s)
00:24:12

[learn fit what's it doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m18s)
00:24:18

[for something like the store model is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m24s)
00:24:24

[a way to interpret the embeddings for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m27s)
00:24:27

[something like this the rustman one yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m30s)
00:24:30

[yeah we'll see that in a moment well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m33s)
00:24:33

[let's jump straight there what the hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m35s)
00:24:35

[okay so so for the rustman how much are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m36s)
00:24:36

[we going to sell at each store on each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[date model we this is from the paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h24m52s)
00:24:52

[gore and burke on it so it's a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m04s)
00:25:04

[paper by the way well worth you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m06s)
00:25:06

[like pretty accessible I think any of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m09s)
00:25:09

[you would at this point be able to at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m12s)
00:25:12

[least get the gist of it if you know and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m14s)
00:25:14

[much of the detail as well particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m16s)
00:25:16

[as you've also done the machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m18s)
00:25:18

[course and they actually make this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m20s)
00:25:20

[in the paper this is in the paper that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m23s)
00:25:23

[the equivalent of what they call entity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m25s)
00:25:25

[embedding layers so an embedding of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m28s)
00:25:28

[categorical variable is identical to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m30s)
00:25:30

[one hot encoding followed by a matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m33s)
00:25:33

[multiply that's why they're basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m37s)
00:25:37

[saying if you've got three embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m39s)
00:25:39

[that's the same as doing three one hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m41s)
00:25:41

[encodings putting each through one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m44s)
00:25:44

[through a matrix multiply and then put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m45s)
00:25:45

[that through a a dense layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[well what pi torch would call a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[oh yeah right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m53s)
00:25:53

[one of the nice things here is because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m56s)
00:25:56

[this is kind of like well they thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h25m58s)
00:25:58

[it was the first paper is actually the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m00s)
00:26:00

[second I think paper to show the idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m01s)
00:26:01

[using categorical embeddings for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m03s)
00:26:03

[kind of data set they really go to clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m06s)
00:26:06

[too quite a lot of detail to you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m08s)
00:26:08

[right back to the the detailed stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m10s)
00:26:10

[that we learnt about so it's kind of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m13s)
00:26:13

[second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[you know a second cat of thinking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[what embeddings are doing so one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m17s)
00:26:17

[interesting things that they did was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m21s)
00:26:21

[they said okay after we've trained a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m23s)
00:26:23

[neural net with these embeddings what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m25s)
00:26:25

[else could we do with it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m31s)
00:26:31

[they got a winning result with a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[network where the entity meetings but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m37s)
00:26:37

[then they said hey you know what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m41s)
00:26:41

[we could take those empty embeddings and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m42s)
00:26:42

[replace each categorical variable with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m45s)
00:26:45

[the learnt entity embeddings and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m48s)
00:26:48

[feed that into a GBM right so in other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m50s)
00:26:50

[words like rather than passing into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m54s)
00:26:54

[GBM a one modern coded version or an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m56s)
00:26:56

[ordinal version let's actually replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h26m58s)
00:26:58

[the categorical variable with its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m01s)
00:27:01

[embedding for the appropriate level for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m04s)
00:27:04

[that row right so it's actually a way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m08s)
00:27:08

[create you know feature engineering and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m11s)
00:27:11

[so the main average percent error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m13s)
00:27:13

[without that for gbms I'm using just 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m18s)
00:27:18

[codings was 0.15 but with that it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m23s)
00:27:23

[0.11 that random forests without that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m25s)
00:27:25

[was point one six with that 0.108 nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m30s)
00:27:30

[as good as the neural net right so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m34s)
00:27:34

[is kind of an interesting technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m37s)
00:27:37

[because what it means is in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m39s)
00:27:39

[organization you can train a neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m42s)
00:27:42

[that has an embedding of stores and an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m45s)
00:27:45

[embedding of product types and an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m47s)
00:27:47

[embedding of I don't know whatever kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m50s)
00:27:50

[of high cardinality or even medium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m52s)
00:27:52

[cardinality categorical variables you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m54s)
00:27:54

[have and then everybody else in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m56s)
00:27:56

[organization can now like chuck those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h27m58s)
00:27:58

[into their you know JVM or random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m00s)
00:28:00

[or whatever and I'm use them and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m03s)
00:28:03

[this is saying is they won't get in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m07s)
00:28:07

[you can even use K nearest neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m09s)
00:28:09

[with this technique and get nearly as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[good a result right so this is a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m13s)
00:28:13

[way of kind of giving the power of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[neural nets to everybody in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[organization without having them do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m21s)
00:28:21

[faster idea of learning course first you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m24s)
00:28:24

[know they can just use whatever SK learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m26s)
00:28:26

[or R or whatever that they're used to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[and like those those embeddings could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m30s)
00:28:30

[literally be in a database table because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m33s)
00:28:33

[if you think about an embedding is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m35s)
00:28:35

[an index lookup right which is the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m37s)
00:28:37

[as an inner join in SQL right so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m40s)
00:28:40

[you've got a table on each product along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m43s)
00:28:43

[with its embedding vector then you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m45s)
00:28:45

[literally do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m48s)
00:28:48

[in a joint and now you have every row in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m48s)
00:28:48

[your table along with its product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m51s)
00:28:51

[embedding vector so that's a really this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m53s)
00:28:53

[is this is a really useful idea and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m55s)
00:28:55

[gbm's and random forests learn a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h28m59s)
00:28:59

[quicker than neural nets do all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m02s)
00:29:02

[that's like even if you do know how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m05s)
00:29:05

[train your on its this is still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m07s)
00:29:07

[potentially quite handy so here's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[happened when they took the various](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m12s)
00:29:12

[different states of Germany and plotted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m14s)
00:29:14

[the first two principal components of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m17s)
00:29:17

[their embedding vectors and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m19s)
00:29:19

[basically here is where they were in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m21s)
00:29:21

[that 2d space and wacken lee enough i've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m23s)
00:29:23

[circled in red three cities and i've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[circled here the three cities in Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m30s)
00:29:30

[and here I've circled in purple so blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m31s)
00:29:31

[here at the blue here's the green here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m34s)
00:29:34

[the green so it's actually drawn a map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m38s)
00:29:38

[of Germany even though it never was told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m41s)
00:29:41

[anything about how far these states are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m44s)
00:29:44

[away from each other or the very concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m47s)
00:29:47

[of geography didn't exist so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m49s)
00:29:49

[pretty crazy so that was from there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m52s)
00:29:52

[paper so I went ahead and looked well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h29m57s)
00:29:57

[here's another thing I think this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m01s)
00:30:01

[also from their paper they took every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m03s)
00:30:03

[pair of places and they looked at how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m05s)
00:30:05

[far away they are on a map versus how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[far away are they in embedding space and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m13s)
00:30:13

[they've got this beautiful correlation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m15s)
00:30:15

[alright so again it kind of apparently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m19s)
00:30:19

[you know it's doors that are near by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[each other physically have similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m24s)
00:30:24

[characteristics in terms of when people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m30s)
00:30:30

[buy more or less stuff from them so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m32s)
00:30:32

[looked at the same thing four days of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m36s)
00:30:36

[the week right so here's an embedding of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m38s)
00:30:38

[the days of the week from our model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[I just kind of joined up Monday Tuesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

[Wednesday Tuesday Thursday Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m45s)
00:30:45

[Saturday Sunday I did the same thing for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m46s)
00:30:46

[the months of the year all right again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m48s)
00:30:48

[you can see you know here's here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m51s)
00:30:51

[winter here's summer so yeah I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m52s)
00:30:52

[like visualize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h30m58s)
00:30:58

[embeddings can be interesting like it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m01s)
00:31:01

[good to like first of all check you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m03s)
00:31:03

[see things you would expect to see you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m06s)
00:31:06

[know and then you could like try and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m08s)
00:31:08

[like maybe things you didn't expect to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m10s)
00:31:10

[see so you could try all kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m12s)
00:31:12

[clusterings or or whatever and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m14s)
00:31:14

[not something which has been widely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m20s)
00:31:20

[studied at all right so I'm not going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m23s)
00:31:23

[tell you what the limitations are of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m25s)
00:31:25

[this technique or whatever oh yes so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m27s)
00:31:27

[I've heard of other ways to generate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m32s)
00:31:32

[embeddings like skip grams uh-huh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m34s)
00:31:34

[wondering if you could say is there one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m37s)
00:31:37

[better than the other using your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m40s)
00:31:40

[Network sir skip grams so screwed grams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m41s)
00:31:41

[is quite specific to NLP right so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m44s)
00:31:44

[I'm not sure if we'll cover it in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m49s)
00:31:49

[course but basically the the approach to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m51s)
00:31:51

[original kind of word to vac approach to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m56s)
00:31:56

[generating embeddings was to say you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h31m58s)
00:31:58

[know what we actually don't have we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m01s)
00:32:01

[don't actually have our labelled data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m07s)
00:32:07

[set you know they said all we have is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m10s)
00:32:10

[like google books and so they have an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m12s)
00:32:12

[unsupervised learning problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m15s)
00:32:15

[unlabeled problem and so the best way in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m16s)
00:32:16

[my opinion to turn an unlabeled problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m19s)
00:32:19

[into a labelled problem is to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m21s)
00:32:21

[invent some labels and so what they did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m23s)
00:32:23

[in the word to vet case was they said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m25s)
00:32:25

[okay here's a sentence with 11 words in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m27s)
00:32:27

[it right and then they said okay let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m30s)
00:32:30

[delete the middle word and replace it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m33s)
00:32:33

[for the random word and so you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m39s)
00:32:39

[originally it said cat and they say no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m44s)
00:32:44

[let's replace that with justice all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m48s)
00:32:48

[right so before it said the cute little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m53s)
00:32:53

[cat sat on the fuzzy mat and now it says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m55s)
00:32:55

[the cute little justice sat on the fuzzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h32m58s)
00:32:58

[man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m01s)
00:33:01

[right and what they do is they do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m01s)
00:33:01

[so they have one sentence where they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m03s)
00:33:03

[keep exactly as is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m06s)
00:33:06

[and then they make a copy of it and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m12s)
00:33:12

[do the replacement and so then they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m14s)
00:33:14

[a label where they say it's a one if it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m16s)
00:33:16

[was unchanged it was the original and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m20s)
00:33:20

[zero otherwise okay and so basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m22s)
00:33:22

[then you now have something you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m27s)
00:33:27

[build a machine learning model on and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m29s)
00:33:29

[they went and build a machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m32s)
00:33:32

[model on this so the model was like try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m33s)
00:33:33

[and find the effect sentences not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m35s)
00:33:35

[because they were interested in a fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m40s)
00:33:40

[sentence binder but because as a result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m42s)
00:33:42

[they now have embeddings that just like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m44s)
00:33:44

[we discussed you can now use for other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m46s)
00:33:46

[purposes and that became word to vet now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m48s)
00:33:48

[it turns out that if you do this as just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m50s)
00:33:50

[a kind of a effectively like a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m55s)
00:33:55

[matrix multiply rather than make it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m58s)
00:33:58

[deep neural net you can train this super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h33m59s)
00:33:59

[quickly and so that's basically what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m01s)
00:34:01

[they did with they'd met there though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m05s)
00:34:05

[they kind of decided we're going to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m06s)
00:34:06

[a pretty crappy model like a shallow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m08s)
00:34:08

[learning model rather than a deep model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m11s)
00:34:11

[you know with the downside it's a less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[powerful model but a number of upsides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m15s)
00:34:15

[the first thing we can train it on a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m18s)
00:34:18

[really large data set and then also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m20s)
00:34:20

[really importantly we're going to end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m22s)
00:34:22

[with embeddings which have really very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m24s)
00:34:24

[linear characteristics so we can like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m27s)
00:34:27

[add them together and subtract them and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m30s)
00:34:30

[stuff like that okay so that so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m32s)
00:34:32

[a lot of stuff we can learn about there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m37s)
00:34:37

[from like for other types of embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m39s)
00:34:39

[like categorical embeddings and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m41s)
00:34:41

[specifically if we want categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m44s)
00:34:44

[embeddings which we can kind of draw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m45s)
00:34:45

[nicely and expect them to us to be able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m48s)
00:34:48

[to add and subtract them and behave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m51s)
00:34:51

[linearly you know probably if we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m52s)
00:34:52

[use them in k-nearest neighbors and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m56s)
00:34:56

[stuff we should probably use shallow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h34m57s)
00:34:57

[learning if we want something that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m00s)
00:35:00

[going to be more predictive we probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m03s)
00:35:03

[want to use a neural net and so actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m06s)
00:35:06

[an NLP I'm really pushing the idea that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m09s)
00:35:09

[we need to move past word to backhand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m14s)
00:35:14

[glove these linear based methods because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m17s)
00:35:17

[it turns out that those embeddings are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m19s)
00:35:19

[way less predictive than embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m21s)
00:35:21

[learnt from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m24s)
00:35:24

[models and so the language model that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m25s)
00:35:25

[learned about which ended up getting a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m27s)
00:35:27

[state-of-the-art on sentiment analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m29s)
00:35:29

[didn't used a lot more work to vet that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m30s)
00:35:30

[instead we pre trained a deep recurrent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m33s)
00:35:33

[neural network and we ended up with not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m35s)
00:35:35

[just a pre trained word vectors but a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m38s)
00:35:38

[for pre-trained model so it looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m40s)
00:35:40

[Duke creates embeddings for entities we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m46s)
00:35:46

[need like a dummy task not necessarily a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m48s)
00:35:48

[dummy task like in this case we had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m51s)
00:35:51

[real task right so we created the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m53s)
00:35:53

[embeddings for Rossmann by trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m55s)
00:35:55

[predict store sales you only need this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h35m56s)
00:35:56

[isn't just in this isn't just for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m01s)
00:36:01

[learning embeddings for learning any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m02s)
00:36:02

[kind of feature space you either need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m05s)
00:36:05

[label data or you need to invent some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m09s)
00:36:09

[kind of fake task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m14s)
00:36:14

[so does that task matter like if I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m16s)
00:36:16

[choose a task and train and lettings if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m18s)
00:36:18

[I choose another task and train and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m20s)
00:36:20

[lettings like which one is it's a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m22s)
00:36:22

[question and it's not something that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m26s)
00:36:26

[been studied nearly enough right I'm not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m28s)
00:36:28

[sure that many people even quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[understand that when they say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m32s)
00:36:32

[unsupervised learning now about nowadays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m34s)
00:36:34

[they almost nearly always mean fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m37s)
00:36:37

[tasks labeled learning and so the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m40s)
00:36:40

[of like what makes a good fake task I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m45s)
00:36:45

[don't know that I've seen a paper on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m48s)
00:36:48

[that right that intuitively you know we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m49s)
00:36:49

[need something where the kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m54s)
00:36:54

[relationships it's going to learn likely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m56s)
00:36:56

[to be the kinds of relationships that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h36m59s)
00:36:59

[you probably care about right so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m01s)
00:37:01

[example in in computer vision one kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m05s)
00:37:05

[of fake task people use is to say like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m09s)
00:37:09

[let's take some images and use some kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m13s)
00:37:13

[of like unreal and unreasonable data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m16s)
00:37:16

[augmentation like like recolor them too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m20s)
00:37:20

[much or whatever and then we'll ask the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m23s)
00:37:23

[neural net to like predict which one was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m25s)
00:37:25

[the Augmented which one was not you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m27s)
00:37:27

[admitted yeah so it's I think it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m29s)
00:37:29

[fascinating area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m37s)
00:37:37

[one which you know would be really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m38s)
00:37:38

[interesting for people to you know maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m41s)
00:37:41

[some of the students here they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m43s)
00:37:43

[looking to further it's like take some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m44s)
00:37:44

[interesting semi-supervised tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m45s)
00:37:45

[unsupervised datasets and try and come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m47s)
00:37:47

[up with some like more clever fake tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m49s)
00:37:49

[and see like does it matter you know how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m54s)
00:37:54

[much does it matter in general like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m56s)
00:37:56

[you can't come up with a fake task that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h37m59s)
00:37:59

[you think seems great I would say use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m01s)
00:38:01

[use the best you can it's an often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m04s)
00:38:04

[surprising how how little you need like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[the ultimately crappy fake task is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m09s)
00:38:09

[called the auto encoder and the auto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m12s)
00:38:12

[encoder is the thing which which one the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m15s)
00:38:15

[claims prediction competition that just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m19s)
00:38:19

[finished on cattle they had lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[examples of insurance policies where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m23s)
00:38:23

[knew this was how much was claimed and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m27s)
00:38:27

[then lots of examples of insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m28s)
00:38:28

[policies where I guess there must have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m30s)
00:38:30

[been still still open we didn't yet know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m32s)
00:38:32

[how much they claimed right and so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m34s)
00:38:34

[they did was they said okay so for all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m36s)
00:38:36

[of the ones so let's basically start off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m39s)
00:38:39

[by grabbing every policy right and we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m41s)
00:38:41

[take a single policy and we'll put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m44s)
00:38:44

[through a neural net right and we'll try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m46s)
00:38:46

[and have it reconstruct itself but in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m50s)
00:38:50

[these intermediate layers and at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m55s)
00:38:55

[one of those intermediate layers will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m57s)
00:38:57

[make sure there's less activations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h38m59s)
00:38:59

[there were inputs so let's say if there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m01s)
00:39:01

[was a hundred variables on the insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m03s)
00:39:03

[policy you know we'll have something in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m06s)
00:39:06

[the middle that only has like twenty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m08s)
00:39:08

[activations all right and so when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m09s)
00:39:09

[basically are saying hey reconstruct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m13s)
00:39:13

[your own input like it's not a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m16s)
00:39:16

[kind of model doesn't require any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m18s)
00:39:18

[special code it's literally just passing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m20s)
00:39:20

[you can use any standard pipe torch or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m23s)
00:39:23

[fast AI learner you just say my output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m25s)
00:39:25

[equals my input right and that's that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m28s)
00:39:28

[like the the most uncreated you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m31s)
00:39:31

[invented task you can create and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m35s)
00:39:35

[called an autoencoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m37s)
00:39:37

[and it works surprisingly well in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m38s)
00:39:38

[to the point that it literally just won](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m41s)
00:39:41

[a cackle competition they took the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m43s)
00:39:43

[features that it learnt and chucked it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m45s)
00:39:45

[into another neural net and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m47s)
00:39:47

[yeah and one you know maybe if we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m49s)
00:39:49

[enough students taking an interest in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m54s)
00:39:54

[this then you know we'll be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m56s)
00:39:56

[cover covered unsupervised learning in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h39m59s)
00:39:59

[more detail in in part two specially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m01s)
00:40:01

[given this cattle have a win I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m03s)
00:40:03

[this may be related to the previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m10s)
00:40:10

[question when training language models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m11s)
00:40:11

[is the language model example trained on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m15s)
00:40:15

[the archive data is that useful at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m18s)
00:40:18

[in the movie great question you know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m19s)
00:40:19

[was just talking to Sebastian about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m26s)
00:40:26

[question read about this this week and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m29s)
00:40:29

[we thought would try and do some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m31s)
00:40:31

[research on this in January it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m32s)
00:40:32

[again it's not well done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m35s)
00:40:35

[we know that in computer vision it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[shockingly effective to train on cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m39s)
00:40:39

[and dogs and use that fruit train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m42s)
00:40:42

[network to do lung cancer diagnosis and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m45s)
00:40:45

[CT scans in the NLP world nobody much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m47s)
00:40:47

[seems to have tried this the NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m52s)
00:40:52

[research as I've spoken to other than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m54s)
00:40:54

[Sebastian about this assume that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m56s)
00:40:56

[wouldn't work and they generally haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h40m58s)
00:40:58

[bother trying I think it would work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m00s)
00:41:00

[great so so since we're talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m01s)
00:41:01

[ruspin I just mentioned during the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m07s)
00:41:07

[I was interested to see like how good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m12s)
00:41:12

[this solution actually actually was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m14s)
00:41:14

[because I noticed that on the public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m17s)
00:41:17

[leader board it didn't look like it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m20s)
00:41:20

[going to be that great and I also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m21s)
00:41:21

[thought it'd be good to see like what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m23s)
00:41:23

[does it actually take to use a test set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m25s)
00:41:25

[properly with this kind of structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m28s)
00:41:28

[data so if you have a look at ruspin now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m30s)
00:41:30

[I've pushed some changes that actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m32s)
00:41:32

[run the test set through as well and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m34s)
00:41:34

[you can get a sense of how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m36s)
00:41:36

[so you'll see basically every line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m38s)
00:41:38

[appears twice one for tests and one-foot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m40s)
00:41:40

[one for train when we get there yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[test train test trains history obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m46s)
00:41:46

[you could do this on a lot fewer lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m48s)
00:41:48

[of code by putting all of the steps into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m50s)
00:41:50

[a method and then pass either the train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m53s)
00:41:53

[data set well the test data set up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m55s)
00:41:55

[dataframe to it in this case i wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h41m57s)
00:41:57

[kind of put for teaching purposes you'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m00s)
00:42:00

[be able to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m02s)
00:42:02

[step and to experiment to see what each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m03s)
00:42:03

[step looks like but you could certainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m05s)
00:42:05

[simplify this code so yeah so we do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m08s)
00:42:08

[for every data frame and then some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m12s)
00:42:12

[these you can see I kind of lived](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[through the data frame in joined and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m17s)
00:42:17

[joint test right training just this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m20s)
00:42:20

[whole thing about the durations I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m24s)
00:42:24

[basically put two lines here one that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m27s)
00:42:27

[said data frame equals train columns one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m30s)
00:42:30

[that says data frame equals test columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m32s)
00:42:32

[and so my you know basically ideas you'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m34s)
00:42:34

[run this line first and then you would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[skip the next one and you'd run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m39s)
00:42:39

[everything beneath it and then you'd go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m40s)
00:42:40

[back and run this line and then run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m42s)
00:42:42

[everything believe it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m45s)
00:42:45

[so some people on the forum were asking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m45s)
00:42:45

[how come this code wasn't working this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m48s)
00:42:48

[week which is a good reminder that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m49s)
00:42:49

[code is not designed to be code that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m52s)
00:42:52

[always run top to bottom without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m54s)
00:42:54

[thinking right you're meant to like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m56s)
00:42:56

[think like what is this code here should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h42m57s)
00:42:57

[I be running it right now okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m00s)
00:43:00

[like the early lessons I tried to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m03s)
00:43:03

[it so you can run it top to bottom but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m05s)
00:43:05

[increasingly as we go along I kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m07s)
00:43:07

[make it more and more that like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m09s)
00:43:09

[actually have to think about what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[going on so Jimmy you're talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m11s)
00:43:11

[shadow learning and deep learning could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m17s)
00:43:17

[you define that a bit better by sure I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m20s)
00:43:20

[learning I think I just mean anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[that doesn't have a hidden layer so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[something that's like a dot product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m25s)
00:43:25

[matrix multiplier basically okay so so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m28s)
00:43:28

[we end up with a training and a test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m40s)
00:43:40

[version and then everything else is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m43s)
00:43:43

[basically the same one thing to note on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m46s)
00:43:46

[a lot of these details of this we cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m50s)
00:43:50

[in the machine learning course by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m51s)
00:43:51

[way because it's not really deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m53s)
00:43:53

[learning specific so check that out if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m54s)
00:43:54

[you're just in the details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m55s)
00:43:55

[I should mention you know we use apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h43m58s)
00:43:58

[cats rather than train cats to make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m00s)
00:44:00

[the test set and the training set have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m02s)
00:44:02

[the same categorical codes and that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m04s)
00:44:04

[join too we also need to make sure that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m09s)
00:44:09

[we keep track of the mapper this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m14s)
00:44:14

[thing which basically says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m15s)
00:44:15

[what's the mean and standard deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m17s)
00:44:17

[of each continuous column and then apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m18s)
00:44:18

[that same method test set and so when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m22s)
00:44:22

[do all that that's basically it then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m27s)
00:44:27

[rest is easy we just have to pass you in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m28s)
00:44:28

[the test data frame in the usual way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m30s)
00:44:30

[when we create our model data object and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m33s)
00:44:33

[there's no changes through all here we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m39s)
00:44:39

[trained it in the same way and then once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m42s)
00:44:42

[we finish training it we can then call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m43s)
00:44:43

[predict as per usual passing in true to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m51s)
00:44:51

[say this is the test set rather than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[validation set and pass that off to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[cattle and so it was really interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m00s)
00:45:00

[because this was my submission it got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m03s)
00:45:03

[public score of 103 which would put us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m08s)
00:45:08

[in about 300 and some things place which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m14s)
00:45:14

[looks awful right and our private score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m21s)
00:45:21

[of 107 need a board private here's about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m25s)
00:45:25

[fifth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m37s)
00:45:37

[right so like if you're competing in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m38s)
00:45:38

[cable competition and you don't haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m42s)
00:45:42

[thoughtfully created a validation set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m45s)
00:45:45

[your own and you're relying on publicly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m47s)
00:45:47

[the board feedback this could totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m49s)
00:45:49

[happen to you but the other way around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m52s)
00:45:52

[you'll be like oh I'm in the top ten I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m53s)
00:45:53

[doing great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m55s)
00:45:55

[and then oh for example at the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m56s)
00:45:56

[the ice Berg's competition recognizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h45m59s)
00:45:59

[icebergs a very large percentage of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m01s)
00:46:01

[public leaderboard set is synthetically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m04s)
00:46:04

[generated data augmentation data like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m07s)
00:46:07

[totally meaningless and so your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m10s)
00:46:10

[validation set is going to be much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m13s)
00:46:13

[helpful and the public leaderboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m15s)
00:46:15

[feedback right so yeah be very careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[so our final score here is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m21s)
00:46:21

[within statistical noise of the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m24s)
00:46:24

[third-place getters so I'm pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m26s)
00:46:26

[confident that we've we've captured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m28s)
00:46:28

[their approach and so that's that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m31s)
00:46:31

[pretty interesting something to mention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m35s)
00:46:35

[there's a nice kernel about the rustman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m40s)
00:46:40

[I quite a few nice kernels actually but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m43s)
00:46:43

[you can go back and see like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m45s)
00:46:45

[particularly if you're doing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m46s)
00:46:46

[groceries competition go and have a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m47s)
00:46:47

[at the Rossmann kernels because actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m48s)
00:46:48

[quite a few of them a higher quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m50s)
00:46:50

[than the ones for the Ecuadorian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m51s)
00:46:51

[groceries competition one of them for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m53s)
00:46:53

[example showed how on four particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m56s)
00:46:56

[stores like straw eighty five the sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h46m58s)
00:46:58

[for non Sundays and the sale for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m02s)
00:47:02

[Sunday's looked very different where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m05s)
00:47:05

[else there are some other stores where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m08s)
00:47:08

[the sales on Sunday don't look any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m09s)
00:47:09

[different and it can kind of like get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m11s)
00:47:11

[sense of why you need these kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m13s)
00:47:13

[interactions the one I particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m14s)
00:47:14

[wanted to point out is the one I think I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m16s)
00:47:16

[briefly mentioned that the third-place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m18s)
00:47:18

[winners whose approach we used they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m20s)
00:47:20

[didn't notice is this one and here's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m22s)
00:47:22

[really cool visualization here you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m25s)
00:47:25

[see that the store this store is closed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m29s)
00:47:29

[right and just after oh my god we run a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m33s)
00:47:33

[we run out of eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m37s)
00:47:37

[and just before oh my god go and get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m38s)
00:47:38

[milk before the store closes alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m41s)
00:47:41

[and here again closed bang right so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m44s)
00:47:44

[third-place winner actually deleted all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m48s)
00:47:48

[of the closed store rows before they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m52s)
00:47:52

[started doing any analysis right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m55s)
00:47:55

[remember how we talked about like don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m57s)
00:47:57

[touch your data unless you first of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h47m59s)
00:47:59

[analyze to see whether that thing you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m02s)
00:48:02

[doing is actually okay no assumptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m04s)
00:48:04

[right so in this case I am sure like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m08s)
00:48:08

[haven't tried it but I'm sure they would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m11s)
00:48:11

[have one otherwise right because like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m13s)
00:48:13

[well though there weren't actually any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m15s)
00:48:15

[store closures to my knowledge in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m16s)
00:48:16

[test set period the problem is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m19s)
00:48:19

[their model was trying to fit to these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m22s)
00:48:22

[like really extreme things and so and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m25s)
00:48:25

[because it wasn't able to do it very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m27s)
00:48:27

[well it was gonna end up getting a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m28s)
00:48:28

[little bit confused it's not gonna break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m30s)
00:48:30

[the model but it's definitely gonna harm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m32s)
00:48:32

[it because it's kind of trying to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m34s)
00:48:34

[computations to fit something which it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m36s)
00:48:36

[literally doesn't have the data for your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m38s)
00:48:38

[neck can you pass that back there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m40s)
00:48:40

[all right so that Russman model again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m42s)
00:48:42

[like it's nice to kind of look inside to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m50s)
00:48:50

[see what's actually going on right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m52s)
00:48:52

[so that Russman model I want to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h48m54s)
00:48:54

[sure you kind of know how to find your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m02s)
00:49:02

[way around the code so you can answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m04s)
00:49:04

[these questions for yourself so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m05s)
00:49:05

[inside columnar model data now um we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m06s)
00:49:06

[started out by kind of saying hey if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m12s)
00:49:12

[want to look at the code for something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m13s)
00:49:13

[you couldn't like a question mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m15s)
00:49:15

[question mark like this and oh okay I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m17s)
00:49:17

[need to I haven't got this reading but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m21s)
00:49:21

[you can use question mark question mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m23s)
00:49:23

[to get the source code for something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m25s)
00:49:25

[right but obviously like that's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m27s)
00:49:27

[really a great way because often you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m31s)
00:49:31

[look at that source code and it turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m33s)
00:49:33

[out you need to look at something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m35s)
00:49:35

[right and so for those of you that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m36s)
00:49:36

[haven't done much coding you might not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m38s)
00:49:38

[be aware that almost certainly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m40s)
00:49:40

[editor you're using probably has the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m43s)
00:49:43

[ability to both open up stuff directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m45s)
00:49:45

[off SSH and to navigate through it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m48s)
00:49:48

[you can jump straight from place to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m51s)
00:49:51

[place right so want to show you what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[mean so if I were to find columnar model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[data and I have to be using vim here I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h49m57s)
00:49:57

[can basically say tag columnar model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m00s)
00:50:00

[data and it will jump straight to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[definition of that plus right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m05s)
00:50:05

[then I notice here that like oh it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m09s)
00:50:09

[actually building up a data loader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m10s)
00:50:10

[that's interesting if I get control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m12s)
00:50:12

[right square bracket it'll jump to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m15s)
00:50:15

[definition of the thing that was under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m17s)
00:50:17

[my cursor and after I finished reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m19s)
00:50:19

[it for a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[I can hit ctrl T to jump back up to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m22s)
00:50:22

[where I came from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m25s)
00:50:25

[right and you kind of get the idea right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m26s)
00:50:26

[or if I want to find it for usage of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m28s)
00:50:28

[this in this file of columnar model data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[I can hit star to jump to the next place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m34s)
00:50:34

[it's new used you know and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m38s)
00:50:38

[alright so in this case get learner was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m41s)
00:50:41

[the thing which actually got the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m46s)
00:50:46

[and we want to find out what kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m49s)
00:50:49

[model it is and apparently it uses a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m51s)
00:50:51

[I'm not using collaborative filtering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m55s)
00:50:55

[are we were using columnar model data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m56s)
00:50:56

[sorry columnar model data okay learner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h50m59s)
00:50:59

[which users and so here you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[mixed input model is the PI torch model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m10s)
00:51:10

[and then it wraps it in the structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[learner which is the the first day I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m16s)
00:51:16

[learn a type which wraps the data and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[the model together so if we want to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m23s)
00:51:23

[the definition of this actual PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m25s)
00:51:25

[model I can go to control right square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m27s)
00:51:27

[bracket to see it right and so here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m30s)
00:51:30

[the model right and nearly all of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m34s)
00:51:34

[we can now understand right so we got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m39s)
00:51:39

[past we got past a list of embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m42s)
00:51:42

[sizes in the mixed model that we saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h51m52s)
00:51:52

[does it always expect categorical and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m04s)
00:52:04

[continuous together yes it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m09s)
00:52:09

[and the the model data behind the scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m15s)
00:52:15

[if there are no none of the other type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m19s)
00:52:19

[it creates a column of ones or zeros or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m21s)
00:52:21

[something okay so if it is null it can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m26s)
00:52:26

[still work yeah yeah yeah it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m30s)
00:52:30

[ugly and hacky and will you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m35s)
00:52:35

[hopefully improve it but yeah you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m36s)
00:52:36

[pass in an empty list of categorical or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m39s)
00:52:39

[continuous variables to the model data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m42s)
00:52:42

[and it will basically yeah it'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m43s)
00:52:43

[basically pass an unused column of zeros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m46s)
00:52:46

[to avoid things breaking and I'm I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m49s)
00:52:49

[leaving fixing some of these slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m54s)
00:52:54

[hacky edge cases because height or 0.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m56s)
00:52:56

[as well as you're getting rid of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h52m59s)
00:52:59

[variables they're going to also add rank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m01s)
00:53:01

[0 tensors which is to say if you grab a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m04s)
00:53:04

[single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m08s)
00:53:08

[thing out of like a rent 110 sir rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m08s)
00:53:08

[than getting back at a number which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[like qualitatively different you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[actually going to get back like a tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m16s)
00:53:16

[that just happens to have no rank now it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m18s)
00:53:18

[turns out that a lot of this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m20s)
00:53:20

[codes gonna be actually easier to write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m21s)
00:53:21

[then so and for now it's it's a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[bit more happier than it needs to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m25s)
00:53:25

[Jeremy you talk about this a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m30s)
00:53:30

[before where maybe it's a good time at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m33s)
00:53:33

[some points talk about how can we write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m35s)
00:53:35

[something that is slightly different for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m38s)
00:53:38

[worries in the library yeah I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m41s)
00:53:41

[we'll cover that a little bit next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m44s)
00:53:44

[that I'm mainly going to do that in part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m47s)
00:53:47

[to like Pat who's going to cover quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m49s)
00:53:49

[lot of stuff one of the main things were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m53s)
00:53:53

[cover in part two is what it called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m55s)
00:53:55

[generative models so things where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m57s)
00:53:57

[output is a whole sentence or a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h53m59s)
00:53:59

[image but you know I also dig into like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m00s)
00:54:00

[powder really either customize the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m03s)
00:54:03

[day I library or use it on more custom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m08s)
00:54:08

[models but if we have time we'll touch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m11s)
00:54:11

[on it a little bit next week okay so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m16s)
00:54:16

[the learner we were passing in a list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m22s)
00:54:22

[embedding sizes and as you can see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m25s)
00:54:25

[embedding sizes list was literally just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m27s)
00:54:27

[the number of rows and the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m28s)
00:54:28

[columns in each embedding right and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m30s)
00:54:30

[number of code rose was just coming from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m32s)
00:54:32

[literally how many stores are there in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m35s)
00:54:35

[the store category for example and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m38s)
00:54:38

[number of columns was just a quarter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m42s)
00:54:42

[that divided by two and a maximum of 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m44s)
00:54:44

[so that thing that list of tuples was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m47s)
00:54:47

[coming in and so you can see here how we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m49s)
00:54:49

[use it right we go through each of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m51s)
00:54:51

[tuples grab the number of categories and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m53s)
00:54:53

[the size of the embedding and construct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h54m57s)
00:54:57

[an embedding all right and so that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m00s)
00:55:00

[that's a list right one minor thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m03s)
00:55:03

[height or specific thing we haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m05s)
00:55:05

[talked about before is for it to be able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m07s)
00:55:07

[to like register remember how we kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m11s)
00:55:11

[said like it registers your parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m13s)
00:55:13

[it registers your your layers like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m15s)
00:55:15

[someone we like listed the model it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m18s)
00:55:18

[actually printed out the Novation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m19s)
00:55:19

[varying an age bias it can't do that if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m21s)
00:55:21

[they're hidden inside a list right they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m24s)
00:55:24

[have to be like a there have to be a an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m27s)
00:55:27

[actual n n dot module subclass so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m29s)
00:55:29

[there's a special thing called an N n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m33s)
00:55:33

[dot module list which takes a list and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m35s)
00:55:35

[it basically says I want you to register](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m38s)
00:55:38

[everything in here has been part of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m40s)
00:55:40

[model okay so it's just a minor tweak so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m42s)
00:55:42

[yeah so our mixed input model has a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m47s)
00:55:47

[of embeddings and then I do the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[thing for a list of linear layers right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m53s)
00:55:53

[so when I said here 1000 comma 500 this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h55m56s)
00:55:56

[was saying how many activations I wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m03s)
00:56:03

[featured my lineal is okay and so here I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m06s)
00:56:06

[just go through that list and create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m09s)
00:56:09

[linear layer that goes from this size to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m13s)
00:56:13

[the next size okay so you can see like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m16s)
00:56:16

[how easy it is to kind of construct your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m19s)
00:56:19

[own not just your own model but a kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m21s)
00:56:21

[of a model which you can pass parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m24s)
00:56:24

[to have a constructed on the fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m26s)
00:56:26

[dynamically and that's normal talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m28s)
00:56:28

[next week this is initialization we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m30s)
00:56:30

[mentioned climbing her initialization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m34s)
00:56:34

[before and we mentioned it last week and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m36s)
00:56:36

[then drop out same thing right we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m40s)
00:56:40

[here a list of how much drop out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m44s)
00:56:44

[apply to each layer right so again here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m46s)
00:56:46

[it's just like go through each thing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m48s)
00:56:48

[that list and create a drop out layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m50s)
00:56:50

[for it okay so this constructor we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m52s)
00:56:52

[understand everything in it except for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m55s)
00:56:55

[batch norm which we don't have to worry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h56m57s)
00:56:57

[about for now so that's the constructor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m00s)
00:57:00

[and so then the forward also you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m03s)
00:57:03

[all stuff we're aware of go through each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m08s)
00:57:08

[of those embedding layers that we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m10s)
00:57:10

[saw and remember we've just treated like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m11s)
00:57:11

[as a function so call it with the ithe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m14s)
00:57:14

[categorical variable and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m16s)
00:57:16

[concatenate them all together put that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[through drop out and then go through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m22s)
00:57:22

[each one of our linear layers and call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m26s)
00:57:26

[it apply relia to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m29s)
00:57:29

[apply dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m32s)
00:57:32

[and then finally apply the final linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m33s)
00:57:33

[layer and the final linear layer has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m36s)
00:57:36

[this as its size which is here right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m40s)
00:57:40

[size one there's a single unit sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m47s)
00:57:47

[okay so we're kind of getting to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[point where oh and then of course at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[end if this I mentioned would come back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m55s)
00:57:55

[to this if you passed in a Y underscore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m57s)
00:57:57

[range parameter then we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h57m59s)
00:57:59

[the thing we just learned about last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m02s)
00:58:02

[week which is to use a sigmoid right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m03s)
00:58:03

[this is a cool little trick to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m06s)
00:58:06

[you're not just to make your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m07s)
00:58:07

[collaborative filtering better but in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m09s)
00:58:09

[this case my basic idea was you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m11s)
00:58:11

[sales are going to be greater than zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m14s)
00:58:14

[and probably less than the largest sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m17s)
00:58:17

[they've ever had so I just pass in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m21s)
00:58:21

[as Y range and so we do a sigmoid and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m25s)
00:58:25

[multiply with the sigmoid by the range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m29s)
00:58:29

[that I passed it all right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m30s)
00:58:30

[hopefully we can find that here yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m33s)
00:58:33

[here it is right so I actually said hey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m37s)
00:58:37

[maybe the range is between zero and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m39s)
00:58:39

[know the highest x one point two you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m43s)
00:58:43

[know cuz maybe maybe the next two weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m45s)
00:58:45

[we have one bigger but this is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m47s)
00:58:47

[like again try to make it a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m49s)
00:58:49

[easier for it to give us the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m51s)
00:58:51

[results that it thinks is right so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m53s)
00:58:53

[increasingly you know I'd love your wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m56s)
00:58:56

[to kind of try to not treat these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h58m59s)
00:58:59

[learners and models as black boxes but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[to feel like you now have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m07s)
00:59:07

[information you need to look inside them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[and remember you could then copy and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m10s)
00:59:10

[paste this plus paste it into a cell in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m12s)
00:59:12

[duple notebook and start fiddling with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m16s)
00:59:16

[it to create your own versions okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[I think what I might do is we might take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m30s)
00:59:30

[a bit of a early break because we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m33s)
00:59:33

[a lot to cover and I want to do it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[in one big go so let's take a let's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m37s)
00:59:37

[a break until 7:45 and then we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m42s)
00:59:42

[to come back and talk about recurrent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m46s)
00:59:46

[neural networks all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m47s)
00:59:47

[so we're going to talk about Aaron ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m56s)
00:59:56

[before we do we've got to kind of dig a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=00h59m58s)
00:59:58

[little bit deeper into SGD because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m02s)
01:00:02

[just want to make sure everybody's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[totally comfortable with with SGD and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m06s)
01:00:06

[what we're going to look at is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m11s)
01:00:11

[going to look at lesson six SGD notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m13s)
01:00:13

[and we're going to look at a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m17s)
01:00:17

[simple example of using SGD to learn y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m19s)
01:00:19

[equals ax plus B and so what we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m26s)
01:00:26

[to do here is we're going to create like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m29s)
01:00:29

[the simplest possible model y equals ax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m32s)
01:00:32

[plus B okay and then we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m36s)
01:00:36

[generate some random data that looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m38s)
01:00:38

[like so so here's our X and here's our Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m43s)
01:00:43

[we want to predict Y from X and we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m46s)
01:00:46

[passed in 3 &amp; 8 as our a and B so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m52s)
01:00:52

[going to kind of try and recover that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m56s)
01:00:56

[right and so the idea is that if we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h00m57s)
01:00:57

[solve something like this which has two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m00s)
01:01:00

[parameters we can use the same technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m03s)
01:01:03

[to solve we can use the same technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m05s)
01:01:05

[to solve something with a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m09s)
01:01:09

[million parameters right without any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m10s)
01:01:10

[changes at all so in order to find a and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m14s)
01:01:14

[a B that fits this we need a loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m22s)
01:01:22

[function and this is a regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m23s)
01:01:23

[problem because we have a continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m25s)
01:01:25

[output so for continuous output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m27s)
01:01:27

[regression we tend to use mean squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m30s)
01:01:30

[error all right and obviously all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m31s)
01:01:31

[this stuff there's there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m33s)
01:01:33

[implementations in non pious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m34s)
01:01:34

[implementations in flight or we're just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m36s)
01:01:36

[doing stuff by hand so you can see all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m37s)
01:01:37

[the steps right so there's MSE okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m39s)
01:01:39

[y hat is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m42s)
01:01:42

[we often call our predictions Y hat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m44s)
01:01:44

[mitis y squared mean there's I meant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m45s)
01:01:45

[whatever okay so for example if we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m48s)
01:01:48

[ten and five where a and B then there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m50s)
01:01:50

[our mean square R squared error three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m54s)
01:01:54

[point two five okay so if we've got an A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m56s)
01:01:56

[and a B and we've got an x and a y then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h01m59s)
01:01:59

[our mean square error loss is just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m00s)
01:02:00

[mean squared error of our linear that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m02s)
01:02:02

[our predictions and our way okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m05s)
01:02:05

[there's a last four ten five X Y all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m07s)
01:02:07

[right so that's a loss function right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m11s)
01:02:11

[and so when we talk about combining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m13s)
01:02:13

[linear layers and loss functions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m18s)
01:02:18

[optionally nonlinear layers this is all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m21s)
01:02:21

[we're doing right is we're putting a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m24s)
01:02:24

[function inside a function yeah that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m26s)
01:02:26

[that's all like I know people draw these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m29s)
01:02:29

[clever looking dots and lines all over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m31s)
01:02:31

[the screen when they're saying this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m35s)
01:02:35

[what a neural network is but it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m36s)
01:02:36

[it's just a function of a function of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m38s)
01:02:38

[function okay so here we've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m39s)
01:02:39

[prediction function being a linear layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m41s)
01:02:41

[followed by a loss function being MSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m43s)
01:02:43

[and now we can say like oh well let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m45s)
01:02:45

[just define this as MSA Lost's and we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m47s)
01:02:47

[use that in the future okay so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m49s)
01:02:49

[our loss function which incorporates our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m51s)
01:02:51

[prediction function okay so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m53s)
01:02:53

[generate 10,000 items or thick data and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[let's show them in two variables so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m00s)
01:03:00

[can use them with PI torch because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[Jeremy doesn't like taking derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m03s)
01:03:03

[so we're going to use PI torch for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m05s)
01:03:05

[and let's create random wait for a and B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m07s)
01:03:07

[so a single random number and we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m11s)
01:03:11

[the gradients of these to be calculated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m14s)
01:03:14

[as we start computing with them because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m16s)
01:03:16

[these are the actual things we need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m19s)
01:03:19

[update in our SGD okay so here's our a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[and B 0.029 0.111 all right so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m24s)
01:03:24

[pick a learning rate okay and let let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m31s)
01:03:31

[do 10,000 epochs of SGD in fact this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m34s)
01:03:34

[isn't really SGD it's not stochastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m40s)
01:03:40

[gradient it said this is actually full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m42s)
01:03:42

[gradient descent we're going to each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m43s)
01:03:43

[each loop is going to look at all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[data okay stochastic gradient descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m48s)
01:03:48

[would be looking at a subset each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[so to do gradient descent we basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m56s)
01:03:56

[calculate loss right so remember we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h03m58s)
01:03:58

[started out with a random a and B okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m01s)
01:04:01

[and so this is going to compute some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m03s)
01:04:03

[amount of loss and then it's nice from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m05s)
01:04:05

[time to time so one way of saying from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m08s)
01:04:08

[time to time is if the epoch number mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m10s)
01:04:10

[a thousand is zero right so every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m13s)
01:04:13

[thousand epochs just print out the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m15s)
01:04:15

[so you have it do it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m17s)
01:04:17

[so now that we've computed the loss we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m21s)
01:04:21

[can compute our gradients right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m23s)
01:04:23

[you just remember this thing here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m26s)
01:04:26

[both a number a single number that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[our lost something we can print but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m32s)
01:04:32

[also a variable because we passed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m34s)
01:04:34

[variables into it and therefore it also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m35s)
01:04:35

[has a method type backward which means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m38s)
01:04:38

[calculate the gradients of everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m41s)
01:04:41

[that we asked it to everything where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m43s)
01:04:43

[said requires radical is true okay so at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m45s)
01:04:45

[this point we now have a dot grad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m48s)
01:04:48

[property inside a and inside P and here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m52s)
01:04:52

[they are here is that grant grad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m57s)
01:04:57

[property okay so now that we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h04m59s)
01:04:59

[calculated the gradients for a and B we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m02s)
01:05:02

[can update them by saying a is equal to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m04s)
01:05:04

[whatever it used to be - the learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m07s)
01:05:07

[rate times the gradient okay dot data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m10s)
01:05:10

[because a is a variable and a variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m14s)
01:05:14

[contains a tensor and it's dot data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m18s)
01:05:18

[property and we again this is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m21s)
01:05:21

[disappear in height which point four but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m24s)
01:05:24

[for now it's actually the ten so that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m26s)
01:05:26

[need to update okay so update the tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m28s)
01:05:28

[inside here with whatever it used to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m31s)
01:05:31

[- the learning rate times the gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m33s)
01:05:33

[okay and that's basically it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m37s)
01:05:37

[all right that's basically all gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m40s)
01:05:40

[descent is okay so it's it's as simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m43s)
01:05:43

[as we claimed there's one extra step in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m45s)
01:05:45

[pi torch which is that you might have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m49s)
01:05:49

[like multiple different loss functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[or like lots of lots of output layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m54s)
01:05:54

[all contributing to the gradient and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m56s)
01:05:56

[like to have to add them all together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h05m59s)
01:05:59

[and so if you've got multiple loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m00s)
01:06:00

[functions you could be calling loss stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m04s)
01:06:04

[backward on each of them and what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m05s)
01:06:05

[does is an ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m07s)
01:06:07

[sit to the gradients right and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m08s)
01:06:08

[have to tell it when to set the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m10s)
01:06:10

[gradients back to zero okay so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m12s)
01:06:12

[where you just go okay set a to zero and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m15s)
01:06:15

[gradients in set B gradients to zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m18s)
01:06:18

[okay and so this is wrapped up inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m21s)
01:06:21

[the you know op TMS JD class right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m25s)
01:06:25

[when we say up Tim dot SGD and we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m31s)
01:06:31

[say you know dot step it's just doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[these for us so when we say dot zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[gradients is just doing this force and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m38s)
01:06:38

[this underscore here every pretty much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m41s)
01:06:41

[every function that applies to a tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[in pi torch if you stick an underscore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m48s)
01:06:48

[on the end it means do it in place okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m50s)
01:06:50

[so this is actually going to not return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m53s)
01:06:53

[a bunch of zeros but it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m54s)
01:06:54

[change this in place to be a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m56s)
01:06:56

[zeros so that's basically it we can look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h06m58s)
01:06:58

[at the same thing without PI torch which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m04s)
01:07:04

[means we actually do have to do some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[calculus so if we generate some fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m10s)
01:07:10

[data again we're just going to create 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m12s)
01:07:12

[data points this time just to make this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m16s)
01:07:16

[fast and easy to look at and so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m18s)
01:07:18

[create a function called update right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m21s)
01:07:21

[we're just going to use numpy no pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m23s)
01:07:23

[torch okay so our predictions is equal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m25s)
01:07:25

[to again linear and in this case we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m28s)
01:07:28

[actually gonna calculate the derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m31s)
01:07:31

[so the derivative of the square of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[loss is just two times and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m34s)
01:07:34

[derivative is the vector a is just that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m37s)
01:07:37

[you can confirm that yourself if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m39s)
01:07:39

[want to and so here our we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[update a minus equals learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m44s)
01:07:44

[times the derivative of loss with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m46s)
01:07:46

[respect to a and for B it's learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m49s)
01:07:49

[rate times derivative with respect to B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m52s)
01:07:52

[okay and so what we can do let's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m54s)
01:07:54

[run all this so just for fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[rather than looping through manually we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m02s)
01:08:02

[can use the map flop matplotlib func](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m04s)
01:08:04

[animation command to run the animate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m07s)
01:08:07

[function a bunch of times and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m12s)
01:08:12

[animate function is going to run 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m14s)
01:08:14

[epochs and at the end of each epoch it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m16s)
01:08:16

[going to print out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m20s)
01:08:20

[on the plot where the line currently is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m22s)
01:08:22

[and that creates this at all movie okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m24s)
01:08:24

[so you can actually see that the line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m27s)
01:08:27

[moving at a place right so if you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m30s)
01:08:30

[to play around with like understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m33s)
01:08:33

[how high torque gradients actually work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m35s)
01:08:35

[step-by-step here's like the world's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m40s)
01:08:40

[simplest at all example okay and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m42s)
01:08:42

[know it's kind of like it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m46s)
01:08:46

[weird to say like that's that's it like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m49s)
01:08:49

[when you're optimizing a hundred million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m52s)
01:08:52

[parameters in a neural net it's doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m53s)
01:08:53

[the same thing but it it actually is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m55s)
01:08:55

[alright you can actually look at the PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m57s)
01:08:57

[torch code and see it's this is it right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h08m59s)
01:08:59

[there's no trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m01s)
01:09:01

[well we load a couple of minor tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m04s)
01:09:04

[last time which was like momentum and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m07s)
01:09:07

[atom right that if you could do it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m09s)
01:09:09

[Excel you can do it invite them so okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m13s)
01:09:13

[so let's do talk about our lens so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m15s)
01:09:15

[now in less than six hour and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m19s)
01:09:19

[notebook and we're going to study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m20s)
01:09:20

[Nietzsche as you should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m29s)
01:09:29

[so Nietzsche says supposing that truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m34s)
01:09:34

[is a woman what then I love this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m38s)
01:09:38

[apparently all philosophers have failed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m41s)
01:09:41

[to understand women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m46s)
01:09:46

[so apparently at the point that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m47s)
01:09:47

[Nietzsche was alive there was no female](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m48s)
01:09:48

[philosophers or at least those that were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[around didn't understand women either so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m52s)
01:09:52

[anyway so this is the philosopher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m54s)
01:09:54

[apparently we've chosen to study it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m56s)
01:09:56

[leech is actually much less worse than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h09m59s)
01:09:59

[people think he is but it's a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m02s)
01:10:02

[era I guess alright so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m05s)
01:10:05

[learn to write philosophy like Nietzsche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m07s)
01:10:07

[and so we're going to do it one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m13s)
01:10:13

[character at a time so this is like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m16s)
01:10:16

[language model that we did in Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m18s)
01:10:18

[four where we did it a word at the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m20s)
01:10:20

[but this time we're going to do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[character at a time and so the main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m22s)
01:10:22

[thing I'm going to try and convince you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m26s)
01:10:26

[is an RNN is no different to anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m28s)
01:10:28

[you've already learned okay and so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m31s)
01:10:31

[show you that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m34s)
01:10:34

[going to build it from plain PI torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m35s)
01:10:35

[layers all of which are extremely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m39s)
01:10:39

[familiar already okay and eventually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m41s)
01:10:41

[we're going to use something really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m43s)
01:10:43

[complex which is a for loop okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m44s)
01:10:44

[that's when we're going to make a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m47s)
01:10:47

[sophisticated so the basic idea of our n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m48s)
01:10:48

[ends is that you want to keep track of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m52s)
01:10:52

[the main thing is you want to keep track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m55s)
01:10:55

[of kind of state over long term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m57s)
01:10:57

[dependencies so for example if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h10m59s)
01:10:59

[trying to model something like this kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m01s)
01:11:01

[of template language right then at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m04s)
01:11:04

[end of your percent comment blue percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m08s)
01:11:08

[you need a percent common end percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m10s)
01:11:10

[right and so somehow your model needs to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m13s)
01:11:13

[keep track of the fact that it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m15s)
01:11:15

[inside a comment over all of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m16s)
01:11:16

[different characters right and so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[is this idea of state it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m21s)
01:11:21

[memory right and this is quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m23s)
01:11:23

[difficult thing to do with like just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m25s)
01:11:25

[calm confident it turns out actually to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m29s)
01:11:29

[be possible but it's it's you know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m31s)
01:11:31

[little bit tricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m34s)
01:11:34

[where elsewhere as an iron in it turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m36s)
01:11:36

[out to be pretty straightforward all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m38s)
01:11:38

[right so these are the basic ideas if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m40s)
01:11:40

[you want the stateful representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[where you kind of keeping track of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m43s)
01:11:43

[where are we now have memory have long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m44s)
01:11:44

[term dependencies and potentially even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m47s)
01:11:47

[have variable length sequences these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m49s)
01:11:49

[all difficult things to do with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m53s)
01:11:53

[confidence they're very straightforward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m54s)
01:11:54

[with arid ends so for example SwiftKey a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h11m57s)
01:11:57

[year or so ago did a blog post about how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m02s)
01:12:02

[they had a new language model where they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m04s)
01:12:04

[basically this is from their blog post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m06s)
01:12:06

[we basically said like of course this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m08s)
01:12:08

[what their neural net looks like somehow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m10s)
01:12:10

[they always look like this on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m14s)
01:12:14

[internet you know you've got a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m15s)
01:12:15

[words and it's basically going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m17s)
01:12:17

[your particular words in their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m19s)
01:12:19

[particular orders and try and figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m21s)
01:12:21

[what the next words going to be which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m23s)
01:12:23

[to say they built a language model they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m25s)
01:12:25

[actually have a pretty good language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m27s)
01:12:27

[model if you've used SwiftKey they seem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m28s)
01:12:28

[to do better predictions than anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m30s)
01:12:30

[else still another cool example was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m31s)
01:12:31

[andre capaci a couple of years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m35s)
01:12:35

[showed that he could use character level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m36s)
01:12:36

[are a 10 to actually create an entire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m39s)
01:12:39

[latex document so he didn't actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m42s)
01:12:42

[tell it in any way what life looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m45s)
01:12:45

[he just passed the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m48s)
01:12:48

[some may tech text like this and said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m49s)
01:12:49

[generate more low text text and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m52s)
01:12:52

[literally started writing something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m54s)
01:12:54

[which means about as much to me as most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m56s)
01:12:56

[math papers do this okay so we're gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h12m58s)
01:12:58

[start with something that's not an RN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m05s)
01:13:05

[and I'm going to introduce Jeremy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m07s)
01:13:07

[patented neural network notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m11s)
01:13:11

[involving boxes circles and triangles so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m15s)
01:13:15

[let me explain what's going on as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m20s)
01:13:20

[rectangle is an input an arrow is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m23s)
01:13:23

[layer as a circle in fact every square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m29s)
01:13:29

[is a bunch of activate so every shape is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m35s)
01:13:35

[a bunch of activations right the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m38s)
01:13:38

[rectangle is the input activations the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m41s)
01:13:41

[circle is a hidden activations and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m43s)
01:13:43

[triangle is an output activations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[arrow is a layer operation right or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m51s)
01:13:51

[possibly more than one all right so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m56s)
01:13:56

[my rectangle is an input of number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[rows equal a batch size and number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[columns equal to the number of number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m04s)
01:14:04

[inputs number of variables all right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m06s)
01:14:06

[so my first arrow my first operation is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m08s)
01:14:08

[going to represent a matrix product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m11s)
01:14:11

[followed by our Lu and that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m13s)
01:14:13

[generate a set of activation remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m17s)
01:14:17

[activations like an activation is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m20s)
01:14:20

[number that an activation is a number a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m23s)
01:14:23

[number that's being calculated by a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m27s)
01:14:27

[value or a matrix product or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m29s)
01:14:29

[it's a number right so this circle here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m32s)
01:14:32

[represents a matrix of activations all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m35s)
01:14:35

[of the numbers that come out when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m39s)
01:14:39

[take the inputs we do a matrix product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m41s)
01:14:41

[followed by a value so we started with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m43s)
01:14:43

[batch size byte number of inputs and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m45s)
01:14:45

[after we do this matrix operation we now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m47s)
01:14:47

[have batch size by you know whatever the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m50s)
01:14:50

[number of columns in our matrix product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m54s)
01:14:54

[was by number of hidden units okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h14m56s)
01:14:56

[so if we now take these activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m00s)
01:15:00

[but it's the matrix and we put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m02s)
01:15:02

[through another operation in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m04s)
01:15:04

[another matrix product and the softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m06s)
01:15:06

[we get a triangle that's our output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m08s)
01:15:08

[activations another matrix of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m10s)
01:15:10

[activations and again number of roses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m12s)
01:15:12

[batch size number of columns number is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m14s)
01:15:14

[equal to the number of classes again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m17s)
01:15:17

[however many columns our matrix in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m18s)
01:15:18

[matrix product head so that's a that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m21s)
01:15:21

[neuro net right that's our basic kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m27s)
01:15:27

[one hidden layer neural net and if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m29s)
01:15:29

[haven't written one of these from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m34s)
01:15:34

[scratch try it you know and in fact in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m35s)
01:15:35

[lessons nine ten and eleven of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m39s)
01:15:39

[machine learning course we do this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m41s)
01:15:41

[we create one of these from scratch so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m43s)
01:15:43

[if you're not quite sure how to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m46s)
01:15:46

[you can check out the machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m47s)
01:15:47

[costs yeah in general the machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m49s)
01:15:49

[learning cost is much more like building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m51s)
01:15:51

[stuff up from the foundations where else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[this course is much more like best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m56s)
01:15:56

[practices kind of top-down all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h15m58s)
01:15:58

[if we were doing like a cognate with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m02s)
01:16:02

[single dense hidden layer our input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m05s)
01:16:05

[would be equal to actually number yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[that's very implied watch number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m11s)
01:16:11

[channels by height by width right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m13s)
01:16:13

[notice that here batch size appeared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m16s)
01:16:16

[every time so I'm not gonna I'm not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m18s)
01:16:18

[gonna write it anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m20s)
01:16:20

[okay so I've removed the batch size also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m21s)
01:16:21

[the activation function it's always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m26s)
01:16:26

[basically value or something similar for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[all the hidden layers and softmax at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m30s)
01:16:30

[end for classification so I'm not going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m33s)
01:16:33

[to write that either okay so I'm kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m34s)
01:16:34

[edge picture I'm going to simplify it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m36s)
01:16:36

[little bit alright so I'm not gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m38s)
01:16:38

[mention batch size it's still there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m41s)
01:16:41

[we're not going to mention real you or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m42s)
01:16:42

[softmax but it's still there so here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m43s)
01:16:43

[our input and so in this case rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m45s)
01:16:45

[than a matrix product will do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m47s)
01:16:47

[convolution let's drive to convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m50s)
01:16:50

[so we'll skip over every second one or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m53s)
01:16:53

[could be a convolution followed by a mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[spool in either case we end up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h16m58s)
01:16:58

[something which is replaced number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m01s)
01:17:01

[channels with number of filters right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m03s)
01:17:03

[and we have now height divided by two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m05s)
01:17:05

[and width divided by 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m08s)
01:17:08

[okay and then we can flatten that out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m09s)
01:17:09

[somehow we'll talk next week about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m12s)
01:17:12

[main way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m15s)
01:17:15

[we do that nowadays which is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m15s)
01:17:15

[to do something called an adaptive max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[pooling where we basically get an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[average across the height and the width](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[and turn that into a vector anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m24s)
01:17:24

[somehow we flatten it out into a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m28s)
01:17:28

[we can do a matrix product or a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m29s)
01:17:29

[of matrix products we actually tend to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m33s)
01:17:33

[do in fast AI so that'll be our fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m34s)
01:17:34

[connected layer with some number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[activations final matrix product give us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m40s)
01:17:40

[some number of classes okay so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m43s)
01:17:43

[our basic component remembering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m46s)
01:17:46

[rectangles input circle is hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m48s)
01:17:48

[triangle is output all other shapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m51s)
01:17:51

[represent a tensor of activations all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[the arrows represent a operation or lay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h17m59s)
01:17:59

[operation all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m02s)
01:18:02

[so now that's going to jump to the one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m04s)
01:18:04

[the first one that we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m06s)
01:18:06

[actually try to try to create for NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m07s)
01:18:07

[and we're going to basically do exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m12s)
01:18:12

[the same thing as here right and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m14s)
01:18:14

[going to try and predict the third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m17s)
01:18:17

[character in a three character sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m18s)
01:18:18

[based on the previous two characters so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m21s)
01:18:21

[our input and again remember we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m25s)
01:18:25

[removed the batch size dimension we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m29s)
01:18:29

[not saying that we're still here okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m33s)
01:18:33

[and also here I've removed the names of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m35s)
01:18:35

[the layer operations entirely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m39s)
01:18:39

[okay just keeping simplifying things so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m41s)
01:18:41

[for example our first import would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m43s)
01:18:43

[the first character of each string in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m46s)
01:18:46

[our mini batch okay and assuming this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m50s)
01:18:50

[one hot encoded then the width is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m54s)
01:18:54

[however many items there are in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m57s)
01:18:57

[vocabulary how many unique characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h18m59s)
01:18:59

[could we have okay we probably won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m01s)
01:19:01

[really one hot encoder will feed it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m04s)
01:19:04

[as an integer and pretend it's one hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m06s)
01:19:06

[encoded by using an embedding layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m08s)
01:19:08

[which is mathematically identical okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m09s)
01:19:09

[and then we that's going to give us some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m12s)
01:19:12

[activations which we can stick through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m15s)
01:19:15

[fully connected layer okay so we we put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m16s)
01:19:16

[that through if we click through a fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m23s)
01:19:23

[connected layer to get some activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m25s)
01:19:25

[we can then put that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m27s)
01:19:27

[another fully connected layer and now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m29s)
01:19:29

[we're going to bring in the input of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m31s)
01:19:31

[character to alright so the character to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m34s)
01:19:34

[input will be exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m36s)
01:19:36

[dimensionality as the character one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m37s)
01:19:37

[input and we now need to somehow combine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m39s)
01:19:39

[these two arrows together so we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m42s)
01:19:42

[just add them up for instance right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m45s)
01:19:45

[because remember this arrow here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m47s)
01:19:47

[represents a matrix product so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m50s)
01:19:50

[matrix product is going to spit out the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m53s)
01:19:53

[same dimensionality as this matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m55s)
01:19:55

[product so we could just add them up to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m56s)
01:19:56

[create these activations and so now we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h19m59s)
01:19:59

[can put that through another matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m02s)
01:20:02

[product and of course remember all these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m04s)
01:20:04

[metrics products have a RAL you as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m05s)
01:20:05

[and this final one will have a softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m08s)
01:20:08

[instead to create our predicted set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m10s)
01:20:10

[characters right so it's a standard you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m13s)
01:20:13

[know two hidden layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m18s)
01:20:18

[I guess it's actually three matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[products neural net this first one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m23s)
01:20:23

[coming through an embedding layer the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m27s)
01:20:27

[only difference is that we're also got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m29s)
01:20:29

[second input coming in here that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m32s)
01:20:32

[just adding in right but it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m34s)
01:20:34

[conceptually identical so let's let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m36s)
01:20:36

[implement that for Nietzsche all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m39s)
01:20:39

[so I'm not going to use torch text I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m46s)
01:20:46

[gonna try not to use almost any fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m48s)
01:20:48

[so we can see it all kind of again from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m51s)
01:20:51

[raw right so here's the first 400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m53s)
01:20:53

[characters of the collected works let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m56s)
01:20:56

[grab a set of all of the letters that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h20m59s)
01:20:59

[see there and sort them okay and so a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m02s)
01:21:02

[set creates all the unique letters so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m06s)
01:21:06

[we've got 85 unique letters in our vocab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m08s)
01:21:08

[let's pop up it's nice to put an empty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m12s)
01:21:12

[kind of a null or some some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m15s)
01:21:15

[padding character in there for padding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m17s)
01:21:17

[so we're gonna put a parenting character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m18s)
01:21:18

[at the start right and so here is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m20s)
01:21:20

[our vocab looks like okay so so Kars is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m23s)
01:21:23

[our bouquet so as per usual we want some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m29s)
01:21:29

[way to map every character to a unique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m33s)
01:21:33

[ID and every unique ID to a character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m37s)
01:21:37

[and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m41s)
01:21:41

[so now we can just go through our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m42s)
01:21:42

[collected works of niche and grab the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m44s)
01:21:44

[index of each one of those characters so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m48s)
01:21:48

[now we've just turned it into this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m51s)
01:21:51

[so rather than quote PR e we now have 40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h21m54s)
01:21:54

[42 29 okay so so that's basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m01s)
01:22:01

[first step and just to confirm we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m08s)
01:22:08

[now take each of those indexes and turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m10s)
01:22:10

[them back into characters and join them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[together and yeah there it is okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m15s)
01:22:15

[from now on we're just going to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m20s)
01:22:20

[with this IDX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m21s)
01:22:21

[list the list of character members in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m23s)
01:22:23

[the connected works of Nietzsche yes so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m26s)
01:22:26

[Jeremy why are we doing like a model of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m30s)
01:22:30

[characters and not a model of words I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m33s)
01:22:33

[just thought it seemed simpler you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m36s)
01:22:36

[with a vocab of 80-ish items we can kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m38s)
01:22:38

[of see it better character level models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m42s)
01:22:42

[turn out to be potentially quite useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m47s)
01:22:47

[in a number of situations but we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m50s)
01:22:50

[cover that in part two the short answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m51s)
01:22:51

[is like you generally want to combine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m54s)
01:22:54

[both the word level model and a connect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m57s)
01:22:57

[character level model like if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m58s)
01:22:58

[doing say translation it's a great way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h22m59s)
01:22:59

[to deal with unknown like unusual words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m02s)
01:23:02

[rather than treating it as unknown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m04s)
01:23:04

[anytime you see a word you haven't seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m05s)
01:23:05

[before you could use a character level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m07s)
01:23:07

[model for that and there's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[something in between the two quarter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m11s)
01:23:11

[byte pair and coding vpe which basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m13s)
01:23:13

[looks at at all engrams of characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m15s)
01:23:15

[but we'll cover all that in part two if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m18s)
01:23:18

[you want to look at it right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m22s)
01:23:22

[then part two of the existing course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m24s)
01:23:24

[already has this stuff taught and part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m27s)
01:23:27

[two of the version 1 of this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m30s)
01:23:30

[although the NLP stuff is in flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m33s)
01:23:33

[which by the way so you'll understand it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m35s)
01:23:35

[straight away it was actually the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m38s)
01:23:38

[that inspired us to move to piped watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m41s)
01:23:41

[because trying to do it in chaos turned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m43s)
01:23:43

[out to be a nightmare all right so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m44s)
01:23:44

[create the inputs to this we're actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m48s)
01:23:48

[going to do something slightly different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m52s)
01:23:52

[what I said we're actually going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m53s)
01:23:53

[I predict the fourth character that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m55s)
01:23:55

[actually this the fifth character using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h23m58s)
01:23:58

[the first four so the index four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m00s)
01:24:00

[character using the index zero one two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m02s)
01:24:02

[and three okay so it was exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m04s)
01:24:04

[same thing but with just a couple more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m06s)
01:24:06

[layers so that means that we need a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m08s)
01:24:08

[of the zeroth first second and third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m11s)
01:24:11

[characters that's why I'm just cutting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m17s)
01:24:17

[every character from the start from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m19s)
01:24:19

[one from two from three skipping over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[three at a time okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m24s)
01:24:24

[so hmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m28s)
01:24:28

[this is I I said this wrong so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m32s)
01:24:32

[going to predict the third character the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m36s)
01:24:36

[fourth character from the third for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m39s)
01:24:39

[first story okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m41s)
01:24:41

[the fourth character is history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m42s)
01:24:42

[all right so our inputs will be these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m46s)
01:24:46

[three lists right so we can just use n P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m50s)
01:24:50

[dot stack to pop them together all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m53s)
01:24:53

[so here's the zero one and two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h24m57s)
01:24:57

[characters that are going to feed into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[model and then here is the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m04s)
01:25:04

[character in the list so for example X 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m05s)
01:25:05

[X 2 X 3 and Y all right so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m13s)
01:25:13

[for example we start off the first the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m23s)
01:25:23

[very first item would be 40 42 and 29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m25s)
01:25:25

[right so that's characters naught 1 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m33s)
01:25:33

[2 and then we'd be predicting 30 that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m36s)
01:25:36

[the fourth character which is the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m40s)
01:25:40

[of the next row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m44s)
01:25:44

[all right so then 30 25 27 we need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m46s)
01:25:46

[predict 29 which is the start of next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m49s)
01:25:49

[row and so forth so we're always using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m52s)
01:25:52

[three characters to predict the fourth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m54s)
01:25:54

[so there are 200,000 of these that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h25m59s)
01:25:59

[going to try and model right so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m05s)
01:26:05

[going to build this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m08s)
01:26:08

[which means we need to decide how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m09s)
01:26:09

[activations so I'm going to use 256 okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m11s)
01:26:11

[and we need to decide how big our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m18s)
01:26:18

[embeddings are going to be and so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m19s)
01:26:19

[decided to use 42 so about half the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m21s)
01:26:21

[number of characters I have and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m24s)
01:26:24

[play around these so you can come up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m27s)
01:26:27

[with better numbers it's just a kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m28s)
01:26:28

[experimental and now we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m30s)
01:26:30

[build our model now I'm gonna change my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m32s)
01:26:32

[model slightly and so here is the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m35s)
01:26:35

[full version so predicting character for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m38s)
01:26:38

[using characters 1 2 &amp; 3 as you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m41s)
01:26:41

[it's the same picture as a previous page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m44s)
01:26:44

[but I put some very important coloured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m45s)
01:26:45

[arrows here all the arrows of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m48s)
01:26:48

[color are going to use the same matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m51s)
01:26:51

[the same weight matrix right so all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m54s)
01:26:54

[our input embeddings are going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h26m58s)
01:26:58

[the same matrix all of our layers that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m00s)
01:27:00

[go from one layer to the next they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m05s)
01:27:05

[going to use the same orange arrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m07s)
01:27:07

[weight matrix and then our output will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m09s)
01:27:09

[have its own matrix so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m13s)
01:27:13

[have one two three weight matrices right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m15s)
01:27:15

[and the idea here is the reason I'm not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m19s)
01:27:19

[gonna have a separate one but every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m22s)
01:27:22

[everything here is that like why would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m24s)
01:27:24

[kind of semantically a carrot to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m27s)
01:27:27

[different meaning depending if it's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m29s)
01:27:29

[first or the second or the third item in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m31s)
01:27:31

[a sequence like it's not like we're even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m33s)
01:27:33

[starting every sequence at the start of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m34s)
01:27:34

[a sentence we're just arbitrarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m36s)
01:27:36

[chopped it into groups of three right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m37s)
01:27:37

[you would expect these to all have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m39s)
01:27:39

[same kind of conceptual mapping and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m41s)
01:27:41

[ditto like when we're moving from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m44s)
01:27:44

[claritin or character one you know to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m45s)
01:27:45

[kind of say build up some state here why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m48s)
01:27:48

[would that be any different kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m51s)
01:27:51

[operation to moving from character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m52s)
01:27:52

[wonder character to so that's the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m53s)
01:27:53

[idea so let's create a three character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h27m56s)
01:27:56

[model and so we're going to create one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m00s)
01:28:00

[linear layer for our Green Arrow one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m04s)
01:28:04

[linear layer fat orange arrow and one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m06s)
01:28:06

[linear layer for our blue arrow and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m09s)
01:28:09

[also one embedding okay so the embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m11s)
01:28:11

[is going to bring in something with size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m16s)
01:28:16

[whatever it was 84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m18s)
01:28:18

[I think vocab size and spit out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m20s)
01:28:20

[something with an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m22s)
01:28:22

[factors in the embedding well then put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m23s)
01:28:23

[that through a linear layer and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m26s)
01:28:26

[we've got our hidden layers before the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m29s)
01:28:29

[output layer so when we call forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m30s)
01:28:30

[they're going to be passing in one two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m34s)
01:28:34

[three characters so if each one will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m37s)
01:28:37

[stick it through an embedding we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m40s)
01:28:40

[stick it through a linear layer and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m42s)
01:28:42

[we'll stick it through a value just to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m44s)
01:28:44

[do it the character one character - and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m46s)
01:28:46

[character three okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m48s)
01:28:48

[then I'm going to create this circle of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h28m51s)
01:28:51

[activations here okay and that matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m05s)
01:29:05

[I'm going to call H right and so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m07s)
01:29:07

[going to be equal to my input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m10s)
01:29:10

[activations okay after going through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m12s)
01:29:12

[value and the linear layer and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m17s)
01:29:17

[embedding right and then I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m19s)
01:29:19

[apply this l hidden so the orange arrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m21s)
01:29:21

[and that's going to get me to here okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m26s)
01:29:26

[so that's what this layer here does and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m30s)
01:29:30

[then to get to the next one I need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m32s)
01:29:32

[reply the same thing and it apply the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m34s)
01:29:34

[orange arrow to that okay but I also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m36s)
01:29:36

[have to add in this second input right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m40s)
01:29:40

[so take my second input and add in okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m43s)
01:29:43

[my previous layer your neck could you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m48s)
01:29:48

[pass it back three rows I don't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m52s)
01:29:52

[see how these dimensions are the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h29m58s)
01:29:58

[from eight and in2 from literature which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m01s)
01:30:01

[from yeah okay let's go through so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m05s)
01:30:05

[figure out the dimensions together so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m07s)
01:30:07

[self dot E is gonna be of length 42 okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m10s)
01:30:10

[and then it's gonna go through L in I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m16s)
01:30:16

[just gonna make it of size n hidden okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m18s)
01:30:18

[and so then we're going to pass that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m24s)
01:30:24

[which is now size n hidden through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m26s)
01:30:26

[which is also going to return something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m30s)
01:30:30

[of size n hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m34s)
01:30:34

[okay so it's a really important to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m35s)
01:30:35

[notice that this is square this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m37s)
01:30:37

[square weight matrix okay so we now know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[that this is of size n hidden into it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m43s)
01:30:43

[going to be exactly the same size as in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m46s)
01:30:46

[one was which is n hidden so we can now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m47s)
01:30:47

[sum together two sets of activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m50s)
01:30:50

[both the size n hidden passing it into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m53s)
01:30:53

[here and again it returns something of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m56s)
01:30:56

[size n hidden so basically the trick was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h30m59s)
01:30:59

[to make this a square matrix and to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m01s)
01:31:01

[sure that it's square matrix was the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m03s)
01:31:03

[same size as the output of this hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m05s)
01:31:05

[well thanks for the great question can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m06s)
01:31:06

[you pass that out to you now Jeremy is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m09s)
01:31:09

[summing the only thing people can do in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m16s)
01:31:16

[these cases I'll come back to that in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m19s)
01:31:19

[moment that's great point okay um I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m21s)
01:31:21

[don't like it when I have like three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m25s)
01:31:25

[bits of code that look identical and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m28s)
01:31:28

[then three bits of codes that look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m29s)
01:31:29

[nearly identical but aren't quiet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m31s)
01:31:31

[because it's harder to refactor so I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m32s)
01:31:32

[going to put a make H into a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m35s)
01:31:35

[zeros so that I can then put H here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m40s)
01:31:40

[these are now identical okay so that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m45s)
01:31:45

[hugely complex trick that we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m49s)
01:31:49

[do very shortly is to replace these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m51s)
01:31:51

[three things with a for loop okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m54s)
01:31:54

[it's going to loop through one two and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h31m57s)
01:31:57

[three that's that's going to be the for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m00s)
01:32:00

[loop or actually zero one two okay at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m02s)
01:32:02

[that point we'll be able to call it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m05s)
01:32:05

[recurrent neural network okay so just to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m06s)
01:32:06

[skip ahead a little bit alright so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m09s)
01:32:09

[create that that model make sure I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m12s)
01:32:12

[run all these so we can actually run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m16s)
01:32:16

[this thing okay so we can now just use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m17s)
01:32:17

[the same columnar model data class that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m24s)
01:32:24

[we've used before and if we use from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m26s)
01:32:26

[arrays then it's basically it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m28s)
01:32:28

[spit back the exact arrays we gave it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m31s)
01:32:31

[right so if we pass if we stack together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m33s)
01:32:33

[those three arrays then it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m36s)
01:32:36

[feed us those three things back to our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m38s)
01:32:38

[forward method so if you want to like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m40s)
01:32:40

[play around with training models using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m43s)
01:32:43

[like you know as roar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m47s)
01:32:47

[approach as possible but without writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m49s)
01:32:49

[lots of boilerplate this is kind of how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m51s)
01:32:51

[to do it here's column Namit model data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m53s)
01:32:53

[from arrays and then if you pass in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m55s)
01:32:55

[whatever you pass in here right you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h32m58s)
01:32:58

[going to get back here okay so I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m01s)
01:33:01

[passed in three things which means I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m06s)
01:33:06

[going to get sent three things okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m09s)
01:33:09

[that's how that works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m11s)
01:33:11

[batch size 512 because this is you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m14s)
01:33:14

[this data is tiny so I can use a bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m16s)
01:33:16

[batch size so I'm not using really much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m18s)
01:33:18

[faster i stuff at all I'm using fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m23s)
01:33:23

[stuff just to save me fiddling around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m25s)
01:33:25

[with data loaders and data sets and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m27s)
01:33:27

[stuff but I'm actually going to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m28s)
01:33:28

[standard ply torch model I'm not going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m30s)
01:33:30

[to create a loner okay so this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m33s)
01:33:33

[standard paper model and because I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m35s)
01:33:35

[using ply towards that means I have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m36s)
01:33:36

[remember to write CUDA okay let's tick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m38s)
01:33:38

[it on the GPU so here is how we can look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m40s)
01:33:40

[inside at what's going on right so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m49s)
01:33:49

[can say it er MD train data loader to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m50s)
01:33:50

[grab the iterator to iterate through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m54s)
01:33:54

[training set we can then call next on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m56s)
01:33:56

[that to grab a mini batch and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h33m59s)
01:33:59

[going to return all of our X's and why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m01s)
01:34:01

[tensor and so we can then take a look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m05s)
01:34:05

[you know here's our X's for example all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m08s)
01:34:08

[right and so you would expect have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m13s)
01:34:13

[think about what you would expect for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m16s)
01:34:16

[this length three not surprisingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m17s)
01:34:17

[because these are the three things okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[and so then XS 0 not surprisingly okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m24s)
01:34:24

[is of length 512 and it's not actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m32s)
01:34:32

[one hot encoded because we use an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m37s)
01:34:37

[embedding to pretend it is okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m38s)
01:34:38

[then we can use a model as if it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m41s)
01:34:41

[function okay by passing to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m42s)
01:34:42

[the variable eyes version of our tensors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m46s)
01:34:46

[and so have a think about what you would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m49s)
01:34:49

[expect to be returned here okay so not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m51s)
01:34:51

[surprisingly we had a mini batch of 512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m56s)
01:34:56

[so we still have 5 12 and then 85 is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h34m58s)
01:34:58

[probability of each of the possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m01s)
01:35:01

[vocab items and of course we've got the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m03s)
01:35:03

[log of them because that's kind of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m05s)
01:35:05

[we do in pi torch okay you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m07s)
01:35:07

[the softmax alright so that's how you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m09s)
01:35:09

[can look inside alright so you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m12s)
01:35:12

[here how to do everything really very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m14s)
01:35:14

[much by hand so we can create an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m15s)
01:35:15

[optimizer again using standard pipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m19s)
01:35:19

[torch so with PI torch when you use a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m22s)
01:35:22

[plate or optimizer you have to pass in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m24s)
01:35:24

[list of the things to optimize and so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m27s)
01:35:27

[you call m dot parameters that will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m29s)
01:35:29

[return that list for you and then we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m31s)
01:35:31

[fit and there it goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m34s)
01:35:34

[okay and so we don't have learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m37s)
01:35:37

[finders and sttr and all that stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m43s)
01:35:43

[because we're not using a learner so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m46s)
01:35:46

[we'll have to manually do learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m47s)
01:35:47

[annealing so set the learning rate a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m48s)
01:35:48

[little bit lower and fit again okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m50s)
01:35:50

[so now we can write a little function to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h35m57s)
01:35:57

[to test this thing out okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m01s)
01:36:01

[so here's something called getnext where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m03s)
01:36:03

[we can pass in three characters like why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m10s)
01:36:10

[full top space right and so I can then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m14s)
01:36:14

[go through and turn that into a tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m17s)
01:36:17

[with capital T of an array of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m19s)
01:36:19

[character index for each character in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m24s)
01:36:24

[that list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m26s)
01:36:26

[so basically turn those into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m27s)
01:36:27

[integers turn those into variables pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m28s)
01:36:28

[that to our model right and then we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m31s)
01:36:31

[do an Arg max on that to grab which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m35s)
01:36:35

[character number is it and in order to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m38s)
01:36:38

[do stuff in none pile and I use two NP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m40s)
01:36:40

[to turn that variable into a lumpy array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m43s)
01:36:43

[right and then I can return that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m45s)
01:36:45

[character and so for example a capital T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m47s)
01:36:47

[because what it thinks would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m49s)
01:36:49

[reasonable after seeing why . space that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m51s)
01:36:51

[seems like a very reasonable way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m55s)
01:36:55

[start a sentence if it was ppl a that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h36m56s)
01:36:56

[sounds reasonable space th a that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m00s)
01:37:00

[bouncer e small a and D space that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m02s)
01:37:02

[sounds reasonable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m05s)
01:37:05

[so it seems to reflect created something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m05s)
01:37:05

[sensible alright so you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m08s)
01:37:08

[important thing to note here is our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m11s)
01:37:11

[character model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m15s)
01:37:15

[is a totally standard fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m17s)
01:37:17

[model right the only slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m21s)
01:37:21

[interesting thing we did was to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m23s)
01:37:23

[do this addition of each of the inputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m27s)
01:37:27

[one at a time okay but there's nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m31s)
01:37:31

[new conceptually here we're training it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m36s)
01:37:36

[in the usual way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m39s)
01:37:39

[all right let's now create an errand in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m42s)
01:37:42

[so an iron in is when we do exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m49s)
01:37:49

[same thing that we did here all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h37m59s)
01:37:59

[but I could draw this more simply by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m03s)
01:38:03

[saying you know what if we've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m05s)
01:38:05

[green arrow going to a circle let's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m07s)
01:38:07

[draw a green arrow go into a circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m10s)
01:38:10

[again and again and again so let's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m12s)
01:38:12

[draw it like this green arrow going to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m14s)
01:38:14

[circle right and rather than drawing an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m16s)
01:38:16

[orange arrow going to a circle let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m18s)
01:38:18

[just draw it like this okay so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m20s)
01:38:20

[the same picture exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m24s)
01:38:24

[picture as this one right and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m27s)
01:38:27

[just have to say how many times to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m32s)
01:38:32

[around this circle right so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m33s)
01:38:33

[if we were to predict character number n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m35s)
01:38:35

[from characters one through n minus one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m37s)
01:38:37

[then we can take the character one input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m39s)
01:38:39

[get some activations feed that to some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m41s)
01:38:41

[new activations that go through remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m44s)
01:38:44

[orange is the hidden to hidden weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m46s)
01:38:46

[matrix right and each time we'll also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m49s)
01:38:49

[bring in the next character of input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m51s)
01:38:51

[through its embeddings okay so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m53s)
01:38:53

[picture and that picture I have two ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h38m57s)
01:38:57

[of writing the same thing but this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m01s)
01:39:01

[is more flexible because rather than me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m04s)
01:39:04

[having to say hey let's do it for H I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m06s)
01:39:06

[don't have to draw eight circles right I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m07s)
01:39:07

[can just say I'll just repeat this so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m10s)
01:39:10

[could simplify this a little bit further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m16s)
01:39:16

[by saying you know what rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m17s)
01:39:17

[having this thing as a special case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m21s)
01:39:21

[let's actually start out with a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m23s)
01:39:23

[zeros right and then let's have all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m26s)
01:39:26

[our characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m28s)
01:39:28

[inside here yes yeah so I was wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m30s)
01:39:30

[if you can explain it be better why are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m39s)
01:39:39

[you reusing those why you think oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m41s)
01:39:41

[they're the same yeah where are you you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m45s)
01:39:45

[kind of seem to be reusing the same same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m47s)
01:39:47

[weight matrices weight matrices yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m50s)
01:39:50

[maybe this is kind of similar to what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m52s)
01:39:52

[did in convolution your Nets like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m55s)
01:39:55

[somehow no I don't think so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h39m57s)
01:39:57

[at least not that I can see so the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m00s)
01:40:00

[is just kind of semantically speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m02s)
01:40:02

[like this arrow here this this arrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m05s)
01:40:05

[here is saying take a character of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m12s)
01:40:12

[import and represented as some says some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m17s)
01:40:17

[set of features right and this arrow is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m21s)
01:40:21

[saying the same thing take some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m24s)
01:40:24

[character and represent as a set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m26s)
01:40:26

[features and so is this one okay so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m27s)
01:40:27

[why would the three be represented with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m30s)
01:40:30

[different weight matrices because it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m32s)
01:40:32

[all doing the same thing right and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m34s)
01:40:34

[orange arrow is saying kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m36s)
01:40:36

[transition from character 0 state to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m40s)
01:40:40

[character 1 state 2 characters to state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m44s)
01:40:44

[again it's it's the same thing it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m46s)
01:40:46

[why would the transition from character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m49s)
01:40:49

[0 to 1 be different to character from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m51s)
01:40:51

[transition from one or two so the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m53s)
01:40:53

[is like but is to like say hey if if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m55s)
01:40:55

[it's doing the same conceptual thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h40m59s)
01:40:59

[let's use the exact same white matrix my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m02s)
01:41:02

[comment on convolution neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m07s)
01:41:07

[is that a filter or so this apply to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m09s)
01:41:09

[multiple places I think something like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m12s)
01:41:12

[convolution is almost like a kind of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m16s)
01:41:16

[special dot product with shared weights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m18s)
01:41:18

[yeah no that's okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m21s)
01:41:21

[that's very good point and in fact one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m22s)
01:41:22

[of our students actually wrote a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m25s)
01:41:25

[blog post about that last year we should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m27s)
01:41:27

[dig that up okay I totally see where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m29s)
01:41:29

[you're coming from and I totally agree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m31s)
01:41:31

[with you all right so let's let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m32s)
01:41:32

[implement this version so this time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m37s)
01:41:37

[we're going to do eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m41s)
01:41:41

[as eight sees okay and so let's create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m43s)
01:41:43

[list of every eighth character from zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m48s)
01:41:48

[through seven and then our outputs will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m52s)
01:41:52

[be the next character and so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m55s)
01:41:55

[stack them together and so now we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h41m57s)
01:41:57

[six hundred thousand by eight so here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m00s)
01:42:00

[an example so for example after this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m05s)
01:42:05

[series of eight characters right so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m11s)
01:42:11

[is characters north through eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m15s)
01:42:15

[this is characters one through nine this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m17s)
01:42:17

[is two through ten these are all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m20s)
01:42:20

[overlapping okay so after characters one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m21s)
01:42:21

[north through eight this is going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m25s)
01:42:25

[the next one okay and then after these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m27s)
01:42:27

[characters this will be the next one all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m30s)
01:42:30

[right so you can see that this one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m33s)
01:42:33

[has 43 is its Y value right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m35s)
01:42:35

[after those the next one will be 43 okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m39s)
01:42:39

[so so this is the first eight characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m42s)
01:42:42

[this is two through nine three through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m46s)
01:42:46

[ten and so forth right so these are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m49s)
01:42:49

[overlapping groups of eight characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m51s)
01:42:51

[and then this is the the next one okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m53s)
01:42:53

[so let's create that model okay so again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h42m57s)
01:42:57

[we use from arrays to create a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m06s)
01:43:06

[data class and so you'll see here we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m09s)
01:43:09

[have exactly the same code as we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m12s)
01:43:12

[before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m14s)
01:43:14

[there's our embedding Linea hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m14s)
01:43:14

[output these are literally identical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m18s)
01:43:18

[okay and then we've replaced our value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m20s)
01:43:20

[of the linear input of the embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m25s)
01:43:25

[with something that's inside a loop okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m27s)
01:43:27

[and then we've replaced the cell hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m30s)
01:43:30

[thing okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m33s)
01:43:33

[also inside the loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m35s)
01:43:35

[I just realize didn't mentioned last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m43s)
01:43:43

[time the use of the hyperbolic tan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m45s)
01:43:45

[hyperbolic tan looks like this okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m48s)
01:43:48

[it's just a sigmoid that's offset right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m57s)
01:43:57

[and it's very common to use a hyperbolic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h43m59s)
01:43:59

[tan inside this trend this state to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m02s)
01:44:02

[state transition because it kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m05s)
01:44:05

[stops it from flying off too high or too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m07s)
01:44:07

[low you know it's nicely controlled back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m09s)
01:44:09

[in the old days we used to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m14s)
01:44:14

[hyperbolic tanh or the equivalent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m15s)
01:44:15

[sigmoid a lot as most of our activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m19s)
01:44:19

[functions nowadays we tend to use value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m22s)
01:44:22

[but in these hidden state to here in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m24s)
01:44:24

[hidden state transition weight matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m28s)
01:44:28

[we still tend to use hyperbolic tanh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m31s)
01:44:31

[quite a lot so you'll see I've done that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m33s)
01:44:33

[also yeah hyperbolic tanh okay so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m36s)
01:44:36

[is exactly the same as before but I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m42s)
01:44:42

[just replaced it with a Pollard and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m43s)
01:44:43

[here's my output yes you know so a does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m45s)
01:44:45

[he have to do anything with convergence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m50s)
01:44:50

[these networks yeah we'll talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m52s)
01:44:52

[that a little bit over time let's let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h44m57s)
01:44:57

[let's come back to that though for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m00s)
01:45:00

[we're not really going to do anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m03s)
01:45:03

[special at all you know recognizing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m04s)
01:45:04

[is just a standard fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m06s)
01:45:06

[Network you know interestingly it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m09s)
01:45:09

[quite a deep one right like because this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m11s)
01:45:11

[is actually this that we've got eight of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m16s)
01:45:16

[these things now we've now got a deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m19s)
01:45:19

[eight layer Network which is why units](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m22s)
01:45:22

[starting suggest we should be concerned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m24s)
01:45:24

[as you know as we get deeper and deeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m26s)
01:45:26

[networks they can be harder and harder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m28s)
01:45:28

[to train but let's try training this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m29s)
01:45:29

[all right so when it goes as before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m37s)
01:45:37

[we've got a batch size of 512 we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m41s)
01:45:41

[using Adam and where it goes so we will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m45s)
01:45:45

[sit there watching it so we can then set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m49s)
01:45:49

[the learning rate down back to 20 neg 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m51s)
01:45:51

[we can fit it again and yeah it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m53s)
01:45:53

[actually it seems to be training fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h45m58s)
01:45:58

[okay but we're gonna try something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m01s)
01:46:01

[which is we're going to use this a trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m05s)
01:46:05

[that your net rather hinted at before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m07s)
01:46:07

[which is maybe we shouldn't be adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m09s)
01:46:09

[these things together and so the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m11s)
01:46:11

[you might want to be feeling a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m14s)
01:46:14

[uncomfortable about adding these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m15s)
01:46:15

[together is that the input state and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m18s)
01:46:18

[hidden state are kind of qualitatively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m23s)
01:46:23

[different kinds of things right the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m26s)
01:46:26

[input state is the is the encoding of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m28s)
01:46:28

[this character for us H represents the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m31s)
01:46:31

[encoding of the series of characters so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m34s)
01:46:34

[far and so adding them together is kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m36s)
01:46:36

[of potentially going to lose information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m39s)
01:46:39

[so I think what your net was going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m42s)
01:46:42

[prefer that we might do is maybe to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m44s)
01:46:44

[concatenate these instead of adding them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m46s)
01:46:46

[so it sound good to you you know she's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m47s)
01:46:47

[not it okay so let's now make a copy of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m49s)
01:46:49

[the previous cell all the same right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m53s)
01:46:53

[rather than using plus let's use cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m56s)
01:46:56

[okay now if we can cat then we need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h46m59s)
01:46:59

[make sure now that our input layer is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m03s)
01:47:03

[not from n fac-2 hidden which is what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m06s)
01:47:06

[had before but because we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m11s)
01:47:11

[concatenated it needs to be in fact plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m12s)
01:47:12

[and hidden to end hidden okay and so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m15s)
01:47:15

[that's going to make all the dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m19s)
01:47:19

[work nicely so this now is of size n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m20s)
01:47:20

[fact plus and hidden this now makes it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m26s)
01:47:26

[back to size n hidden again okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m30s)
01:47:30

[then this is putting it through the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m33s)
01:47:33

[square matrix as before so it's still a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m35s)
01:47:35

[size n here okay so this is like a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m37s)
01:47:37

[design heuristic if you're designing an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m42s)
01:47:42

[architecture is if you've got different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m45s)
01:47:45

[types of information that you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m47s)
01:47:47

[combine you generally want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m49s)
01:47:49

[concatenate it okay you know adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m51s)
01:47:51

[things together even if they're the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m54s)
01:47:54

[shape is losing information okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h47m56s)
01:47:56

[once you've concatenated things together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m00s)
01:48:00

[you can always convert it back down to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m02s)
01:48:02

[fixed size by just tracking it through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m05s)
01:48:05

[matrix product okay so that's what we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m08s)
01:48:08

[done here again it's the same thing but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m11s)
01:48:11

[now we're concatenating instead and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m12s)
01:48:12

[we can fit that and so last time we got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m17s)
01:48:17

[one point seven two this time you go at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m19s)
01:48:19

[one point six six so it's not setting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m23s)
01:48:23

[the world on fire but it's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m25s)
01:48:25

[improvement and the improvements of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m26s)
01:48:26

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m28s)
01:48:28

[so we can now test that with get next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m29s)
01:48:29

[and so now we can pass in eight things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m32s)
01:48:32

[right so it's no before those let's go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m34s)
01:48:34

[to a part of that sounds good as well so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m38s)
01:48:38

[Queens and that sounds good too all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m41s)
01:48:41

[right so great so that's enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m45s)
01:48:45

[manual hackery let's see if pi torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m49s)
01:48:49

[couldn't do some of this for us and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m53s)
01:48:53

[basically what pi torch will do for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m55s)
01:48:55

[is it will write this loop automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h48m58s)
01:48:58

[okay and it will create these linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m02s)
01:49:02

[input layers automatically okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m05s)
01:49:05

[to ask it to do that we can use the n n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m08s)
01:49:08

[dot R and n plus so here's the exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m11s)
01:49:11

[same thing in less code by taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m15s)
01:49:15

[advantage of height choice and again I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m19s)
01:49:19

[not using a conceptual analogy to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m21s)
01:49:21

[player torches doing something like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m23s)
01:49:23

[I'm saying play torch is doing it now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m25s)
01:49:25

[this is just the code you just saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m28s)
01:49:28

[wrapped up a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m30s)
01:49:30

[reflect it a little bit for your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m32s)
01:49:32

[convenience right so where we say we now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m33s)
01:49:33

[want to create an era ten call our it n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m36s)
01:49:36

[then what this does is it does that for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m39s)
01:49:39

[live now notice that our for loop needed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m43s)
01:49:43

[a starting point you remember why right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m47s)
01:49:47

[because otherwise our for loop didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m51s)
01:49:51

[quite work we couldn't quite refactor it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m53s)
01:49:53

[out and because this is exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m54s)
01:49:54

[this needs our starting point to and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m56s)
01:49:56

[let's give it a starting point and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h49m59s)
01:49:59

[you have to pass in your initial hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m01s)
01:50:01

[State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m03s)
01:50:03

[for reasons that will become apparent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m05s)
01:50:05

[later on it turns out to be quite useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m07s)
01:50:07

[to be able to get back that here in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m14s)
01:50:14

[state at the end and just like we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m17s)
01:50:17

[here we could actually keep track of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m20s)
01:50:20

[hidden state we get back to things we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m21s)
01:50:21

[get back both the output and the hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m25s)
01:50:25

[state right so we pass in the input in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m28s)
01:50:28

[the hidden State when we get back the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m30s)
01:50:30

[output and the hidden state yes could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m32s)
01:50:32

[you remind us what the hint state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m36s)
01:50:36

[represents the hidden state is H so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m38s)
01:50:38

[the it's the orange circle ellipse of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m42s)
01:50:42

[activations okay and so it is of size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m49s)
01:50:49

[256 okay all right so we can okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h50m54s)
01:50:54

[there's one other thing too to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m06s)
01:51:06

[which is in our case we were replacing H](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m07s)
01:51:07

[with a new hidden state the one minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m11s)
01:51:11

[difference in pi torch is they append](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m16s)
01:51:16

[the new hidden state to a list or to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m19s)
01:51:19

[tensor which gets bigger and bigger so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m22s)
01:51:22

[they actually give you back all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m24s)
01:51:24

[hidden states so in other words rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m25s)
01:51:25

[than just giving you back the final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m27s)
01:51:27

[ellipse they give you back all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m29s)
01:51:29

[ellipses stacked on top of each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m32s)
01:51:32

[and so because we just want the final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m33s)
01:51:33

[one I was got indexed into it with minus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m35s)
01:51:35

[one here okay other than that this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m38s)
01:51:38

[the same code as before put that through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m40s)
01:51:40

[our output layer to get the correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m44s)
01:51:44

[vocab size and then we can train that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m46s)
01:51:46

[alright so you can see here I can do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m57s)
01:51:57

[manually I can create some hidden state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h51m59s)
01:51:59

[I can pass it to that area and I can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m01s)
01:52:01

[the stuff I get back you'll see that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m03s)
01:52:03

[dimensionality of H it's actually a rank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m08s)
01:52:08

[3 tensor where else in my version it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m12s)
01:52:12

[a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m16s)
01:52:16

[let's see it was a rank two tensor okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m19s)
01:52:19

[and the difference is here we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m23s)
01:52:23

[just a unit axis at the front we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m25s)
01:52:25

[learn more about why that is later but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m28s)
01:52:28

[basically it turns out you can have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m30s)
01:52:30

[second R and n that goes backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m32s)
01:52:32

[alright one that goes forwards one that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m34s)
01:52:34

[goes backwards from the idea is neck and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m36s)
01:52:36

[then it's going to be better at finding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m38s)
01:52:38

[relationships that kind of go backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m40s)
01:52:40

[that's quite a bi-directional eridan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m43s)
01:52:43

[also it turns out you can have an error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m44s)
01:52:44

[in feed to an iron in that's got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m47s)
01:52:47

[multi-layer eridan so basically if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m48s)
01:52:48

[have those things you need an additional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m51s)
01:52:51

[access on your tensor to keep track of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m53s)
01:52:53

[those additional layers of hidden state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m56s)
01:52:56

[but for now we'll always have a one yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h52m58s)
01:52:58

[and we'll always also get back a one at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m01s)
01:53:01

[the end okay so if we go ahead and fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m05s)
01:53:05

[this now let's actually trade it for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m10s)
01:53:10

[bit longer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m13s)
01:53:13

[okay so last time we only kind of did a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m14s)
01:53:14

[couple of epochs this time we're due for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m17s)
01:53:17

[a pox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m20s)
01:53:20

[what have we sit at one in egg three and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m21s)
01:53:21

[then we'll do another to epochs at one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m24s)
01:53:24

[in egg four and so we've now got our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m28s)
01:53:28

[lost down to one point five so getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m31s)
01:53:31

[better and better so here's our get next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m34s)
01:53:34

[again okay and you know let's just it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m39s)
01:53:39

[was the same thing so what we can now do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m43s)
01:53:43

[is we can look through like forty times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m45s)
01:53:45

[calling get next each time and then each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m49s)
01:53:49

[time will replace our input by removing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m52s)
01:53:52

[the first character and adding the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m54s)
01:53:54

[that we just predicted and so that way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m56s)
01:53:56

[we can like feed in a new set of eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h53m58s)
01:53:58

[characters that get them again and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m00s)
01:54:00

[and so that way we'll call that get next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m02s)
01:54:02

[in so here are 40 characters that we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m05s)
01:54:05

[generated so we started out with four th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m09s)
01:54:09

[OS so we got four those of the same -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m11s)
01:54:11

[the same - the same you can probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m14s)
01:54:14

[guess what happens if you can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m17s)
01:54:17

[predicting the same - the same all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m18s)
01:54:18

[so it's you know it's doing okay we we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m20s)
01:54:20

[now have something which you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m25s)
01:54:25

[we've basically built from scratch and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m31s)
01:54:31

[then we've said here's how high torture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m33s)
01:54:33

[effected it for us so if you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m37s)
01:54:37

[like have an interesting little homework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m39s)
01:54:39

[assignment this week try to write your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m41s)
01:54:41

[own version of an RNN plus all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m44s)
01:54:44

[like try to like literally like create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m48s)
01:54:48

[your like you know Jeremy's aren't in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m51s)
01:54:51

[and then like type in here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m53s)
01:54:53

[Jeremy's aren't in or in your case maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m55s)
01:54:55

[your name's not Jeremy which is okay too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h54m58s)
01:54:58

[and then get it to run writing your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m00s)
01:55:00

[implementation that's fast from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m04s)
01:55:04

[without looking at the piped water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m06s)
01:55:06

[source code you know like basically it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m07s)
01:55:07

[just a case of like going up and seeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m10s)
01:55:10

[what we did back here right and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m12s)
01:55:12

[make sure you get the same answers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m14s)
01:55:14

[confirm that you do so that's kind of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m17s)
01:55:17

[good little test simply simple at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m19s)
01:55:19

[assignment but I think you'll feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m21s)
01:55:21

[really good when you seem like oh I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m24s)
01:55:24

[just reimplemented an end alone in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m25s)
01:55:25

[alright so I'm going to do one other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m30s)
01:55:30

[thing when I switched from this one when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m36s)
01:55:36

[I've moved the car one input inside the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m37s)
01:55:37

[dotted line right this dotted rectangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m40s)
01:55:40

[represents the thing I'm repeating I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m41s)
01:55:41

[also watch the triangle the output I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m44s)
01:55:44

[moved that inside as well now that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m47s)
01:55:47

[big difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m51s)
01:55:51

[because now what I've actually done is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m51s)
01:55:51

[I'm actually saying spit out an output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m55s)
01:55:55

[after every one of these circles so spit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h55m59s)
01:55:59

[out an output here and here and here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m03s)
01:56:03

[alright so in other words if I have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m07s)
01:56:07

[three character input I'm going to spit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m09s)
01:56:09

[out a three character output I'm saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m12s)
01:56:12

[half the character 1 this will be next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m13s)
01:56:13

[after character to this be next after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m15s)
01:56:15

[character 3 this will be next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m17s)
01:56:17

[so again nothing different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m20s)
01:56:20

[and again this you know if you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m24s)
01:56:24

[go a bit further with the assignment you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m26s)
01:56:26

[could write this by hand as well but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m28s)
01:56:28

[basically what we're saying is in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m31s)
01:56:31

[for loop would be saying like you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m33s)
01:56:33

[results equals some empty list right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m37s)
01:56:37

[then would be going through and rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m41s)
01:56:41

[than returning that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m42s)
01:56:42

[we're instead be saying you know results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m44s)
01:56:44

[dot append that right and then like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m48s)
01:56:48

[return whatever torch dot stat something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h56m55s)
01:56:55

[like that right that it made me right in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m00s)
01:57:00

[my question so now you know we now have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m02s)
01:57:02

[like every step we've created an output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m05s)
01:57:05

[okay so which is basically this picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m09s)
01:57:09

[and so the reason was lots of reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m13s)
01:57:13

[that's interesting but I think the main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m16s)
01:57:16

[reason right now that's interesting is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m19s)
01:57:19

[that you probably noticed this this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m21s)
01:57:21

[approach to dealing with our data seems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m29s)
01:57:29

[terribly inefficient like we're grabbing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m32s)
01:57:32

[the first eight right but then this next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m34s)
01:57:34

[set all but one of them overlap the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m38s)
01:57:38

[previous one right so we're kind of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m41s)
01:57:41

[recalculating the exact set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m45s)
01:57:45

[embeddings seven out of eight of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m48s)
01:57:48

[are going to be exact same embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m50s)
01:57:50

[right exact same transitions it kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m51s)
01:57:51

[seems weird to like do all this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m55s)
01:57:55

[calculation to just predict one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h57m58s)
01:57:58

[and then go back and recalculate seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m00s)
01:58:00

[out of eight of them and add one more to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m02s)
01:58:02

[the end to calculate the next thing all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m04s)
01:58:04

[right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m06s)
01:58:06

[so the basic idea then is to say well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m06s)
01:58:06

[let's not do it that way instead let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m09s)
01:58:09

[taking non overlapping sets of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m16s)
01:58:16

[characters all right so like so here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m18s)
01:58:18

[our first eight characters here is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m22s)
01:58:22

[next day characters here are the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m25s)
01:58:25

[day characters so like if you read this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m27s)
01:58:27

[top left to bottom right that would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m29s)
01:58:29

[the whole nature right and so then if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m32s)
01:58:32

[these are the first eight characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m38s)
01:58:38

[then offset this by one starting here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m39s)
01:58:39

[that's a list of outputs right so after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m43s)
01:58:43

[we see characters zero through seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m48s)
01:58:48

[we should predict characters 1 through 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m51s)
01:58:51

[the XS so after 40 should come 42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m54s)
01:58:54

[as it did after 42 should come 29 as it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h58m58s)
01:58:58

[did okay and so now that can be our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m02s)
01:59:02

[inputs and labels for that model and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m05s)
01:59:05

[it shouldn't be any more or less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m11s)
01:59:11

[accurate it should just be the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m14s)
01:59:14

[right pretty much but it should allow us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m17s)
01:59:17

[to do it more efficiently so let's try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m20s)
01:59:20

[that all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m27s)
01:59:27

[so I mentioned last time that we had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m34s)
01:59:34

[minus 1 index here because we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m40s)
01:59:40

[wanted to grab the last triangle okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m43s)
01:59:43

[in this case we're going to grab all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m48s)
01:59:48

[triangles so this this is actually the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m50s)
01:59:50

[way it end on RNN creates things we we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m52s)
01:59:52

[only kept the last one but this time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m55s)
01:59:55

[we're going to keep all of them so we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=01h59m58s)
01:59:58

[made one change which is to remove that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m06s)
02:00:06

[minus one other than that this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m07s)
02:00:07

[exact same code as before okay so but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m12s)
02:00:12

[there's nothing much to show you here I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m22s)
02:00:22

[mean except of course at this time if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m24s)
02:00:24

[look at the labels it's now 512 by eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m26s)
02:00:26

[factors we're trying to predict eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m31s)
02:00:31

[things every time through so there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m33s)
02:00:33

[one complexity here which is that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m38s)
02:00:38

[want to use the negative log likelihood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m42s)
02:00:42

[loss function as before right but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m46s)
02:00:46

[ligand if lost likelihood loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m50s)
02:00:50

[just like our MSE expects to receive to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m53s)
02:00:53

[rank one tensors actually with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m56s)
02:00:56

[mini-batch access to rank two tensors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h00m59s)
02:00:59

[all right so two to mini-batches of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m02s)
02:01:02

[vectors problem is that we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m05s)
02:01:05

[eight-time steps you know it characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m12s)
02:01:12

[in an RNN we call it a time step right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m15s)
02:01:15

[we have eight time steps and then for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m18s)
02:01:18

[each one we have 84 probabilities we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m20s)
02:01:20

[have the probability for every single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m24s)
02:01:24

[one of those eight times deaths and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m27s)
02:01:27

[we have that for each of our 512 items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m30s)
02:01:30

[in the mini batch so we have a rank 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m34s)
02:01:34

[tensor not a rank two tensor um so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m37s)
02:01:37

[means that the negative log likelihood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m42s)
02:01:42

[loss function is going to spit out an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m44s)
02:01:44

[error now frankly I think this is kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m46s)
02:01:46

[of dumb you know I think it would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m48s)
02:01:48

[better if PI torch had written the loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m50s)
02:01:50

[functions in such a way that they didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m54s)
02:01:54

[care at all about rank and they just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m56s)
02:01:56

[applied it to whatever rank you gave it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h01m59s)
02:01:59

[but for now at least it does care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m01s)
02:02:01

[rick but the nice thing is I get to show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m05s)
02:02:05

[you how to write a custom loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m07s)
02:02:07

[okay so we're going to create a special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m09s)
02:02:09

[negative log likelihood loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m11s)
02:02:11

[for sequences okay and so it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m14s)
02:02:14

[take an input in the target and it's got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m17s)
02:02:17

[a call f dot negative log likelihood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m19s)
02:02:19

[lost so the pipe launched one all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m21s)
02:02:21

[but what we're going to do is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m25s)
02:02:25

[going to flatten our input and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m28s)
02:02:28

[going to flatten our targets right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m33s)
02:02:33

[so and it turns out these are going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m37s)
02:02:37

[be the first two axes that I have to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m40s)
02:02:40

[transposed so the way PI torch handles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m45s)
02:02:45

[are and end data by default is the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m50s)
02:02:50

[axis is the sequence length in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m54s)
02:02:54

[eight right so the sequence length of an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m56s)
02:02:56

[R and n is how many times deaths so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h02m59s)
02:02:59

[have eight characters so a sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m02s)
02:03:02

[length of eight the second axis is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m04s)
02:03:04

[batch size and then as would expect the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m06s)
02:03:06

[third axis is the actual hidden state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m10s)
02:03:10

[itself okay so this is going to be eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m12s)
02:03:12

[by 512 by n hidden which I think was 256](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m15s)
02:03:15

[yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m22s)
02:03:22

[okay so we can grab the size and unpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m24s)
02:03:24

[it into each of these sequence length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m28s)
02:03:28

[batch size and I'm hidden now target](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m31s)
02:03:31

[mighty dot size is 512 by 8 where else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m39s)
02:03:39

[this one here was 8 by 512 so to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m49s)
02:03:49

[them match we're going to have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m53s)
02:03:53

[transpose the first two axis okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h03m55s)
02:03:55

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m00s)
02:04:00

[hi torch when you do something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m01s)
02:04:01

[transpose doesn't generally actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m04s)
02:04:04

[shuffle the memory order but instead it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m06s)
02:04:06

[just kind of keeps some internal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m09s)
02:04:09

[metadata to say like hey you should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m11s)
02:04:11

[treat this as if it's transposed and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m13s)
02:04:13

[some things in pi torch will give you an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m17s)
02:04:17

[error if you try and use it when it has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m20s)
02:04:20

[these like this internal state and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m23s)
02:04:23

[basically say error this tensor is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m26s)
02:04:26

[contiguous if you ever see that error at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m30s)
02:04:30

[the word contiguous after it and it goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m33s)
02:04:33

[away so I don't know they can't do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m35s)
02:04:35

[for you apparently so in this particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m38s)
02:04:38

[case I got that error so I wrote the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m39s)
02:04:39

[code contiguous after it okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m41s)
02:04:41

[then finally we need to flatten it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m44s)
02:04:44

[into a single vector and so we can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m46s)
02:04:46

[go a dot view which is the same as non](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m49s)
02:04:49

[PI dot reshape and minus one means as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m50s)
02:04:50

[long as it needs to be okay and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m53s)
02:04:53

[input again we also reshape that right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h04m58s)
02:04:58

[but remember the input sorry the the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m02s)
02:05:02

[predictions also have this axis of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m05s)
02:05:05

[length 84 all of the predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m09s)
02:05:09

[probabilities okay so so here's a custom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m11s)
02:05:11

[these are custom lost function that's it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m15s)
02:05:15

[right so if you ever want to play around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m18s)
02:05:18

[with your own loss functions you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m20s)
02:05:20

[just do that like so and then pass that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m22s)
02:05:22

[to fit okay so it's important to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m27s)
02:05:27

[remember that Fitch is this like lowest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m30s)
02:05:30

[level fast AI abstraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m34s)
02:05:34

[that's--it's that this is the thing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m37s)
02:05:37

[implements the training look okay and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m39s)
02:05:39

[like you're the stuff you pass it in is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m42s)
02:05:42

[all standard pi torch stuff except for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m45s)
02:05:45

[this this is our model data object this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m50s)
02:05:50

[is the thing that wraps up the test set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m53s)
02:05:53

[the training set and the validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m56s)
02:05:56

[to get that okay your neck could you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h05m58s)
02:05:58

[pass that back so when we pull the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m01s)
02:06:01

[triangle into the replicator structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m06s)
02:06:06

[right so the the first n minus one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m09s)
02:06:09

[iterations of the sequence length we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m13s)
02:06:13

[don't see the whole sequence length yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m15s)
02:06:15

[so does that mean that the batch size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m18s)
02:06:18

[should be much bigger so that be careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m20s)
02:06:20

[you don't mean that size you main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m24s)
02:06:24

[sequence length right because the batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m26s)
02:06:26

[size is like some firing yeah okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m28s)
02:06:28

[yes yes if you have a short sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m31s)
02:06:31

[length like eight yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m34s)
02:06:34

[the first character has nothing to go on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m37s)
02:06:37

[it starts with an empty hidden state of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m41s)
02:06:41

[zeros okay so what we're going to start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m46s)
02:06:46

[with next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m49s)
02:06:49

[is we're going to learn how to avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m51s)
02:06:51

[that problem right and so it's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m52s)
02:06:52

[insightful question or concern right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m55s)
02:06:55

[but if you think about it the basic idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h06m59s)
02:06:59

[is why should we reset this to zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m01s)
02:07:01

[every time you know like if we can kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m05s)
02:07:05

[of line up these mini batches somehow so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m09s)
02:07:09

[that the next mini batch joins up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m13s)
02:07:13

[correctly it represents like the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m16s)
02:07:16

[letter in leaches works then we'd want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m18s)
02:07:18

[to move this up into the constructor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m22s)
02:07:22

[right and then like pass that here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m26s)
02:07:26

[then store it here right and now we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m32s)
02:07:32

[not resetting the hidden state each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m38s)
02:07:38

[we're actually we're actually keeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m40s)
02:07:40

[the hidden state from call to call and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m43s)
02:07:43

[so the only time that it would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m45s)
02:07:45

[failing to benefit from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m48s)
02:07:48

[learning state would be like literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m51s)
02:07:51

[at the very start of the document so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m53s)
02:07:53

[that's where but that's where we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m55s)
02:07:55

[going to try and ahead next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m56s)
02:07:56

[I feel like this lesson every time I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h07m58s)
02:07:58

[got a punch line coming somebody asks me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m09s)
02:08:09

[a question where I have to like do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m11s)
02:08:11

[punch line ahead of time okay so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m13s)
02:08:13

[fit that and we can fit that and I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m17s)
02:08:17

[to show you something interesting and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m21s)
02:08:21

[this is coming to the punch line that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m22s)
02:08:22

[another punch line that you net try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m25s)
02:08:25

[spoil which is when we're you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m27s)
02:08:27

[remember this is just doing a loop right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m33s)
02:08:33

[applying the same matrix multiply again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m35s)
02:08:35

[and again if that matrix multiply tends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m37s)
02:08:37

[to increase the activations each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m42s)
02:08:42

[then effectively we're doing that to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m46s)
02:08:46

[power of eight right so it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m48s)
02:08:48

[like to shoot off really high or if it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m50s)
02:08:50

[decreasing it a little bit each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m53s)
02:08:53

[that's going to shoot off really low so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m54s)
02:08:54

[this is what we call a gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m57s)
02:08:57

[explosion right and so we really want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h08m58s)
02:08:58

[make sure that the initial H naught H](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m01s)
02:09:01

[the initial but if we call it the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m07s)
02:09:07

[initial L hidden that we create is is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m11s)
02:09:11

[like oversize that's not going to cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m16s)
02:09:16

[our activations on average to increase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m19s)
02:09:19

[or decrease right and there's actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m22s)
02:09:22

[very nice matrix that does exactly that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m25s)
02:09:25

[called the identity matrix so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m29s)
02:09:29

[identity matrix for those that don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m33s)
02:09:33

[quite remember their linear algebra is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m35s)
02:09:35

[this this would be a size 3 identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m39s)
02:09:39

[matrix all right and so the trick about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m42s)
02:09:42

[an identity matrix is anything times an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m46s)
02:09:46

[identity matrix is itself right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m49s)
02:09:49

[therefore you could multiply it by this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m52s)
02:09:52

[again and again and again and again and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m54s)
02:09:54

[still end up with itself right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m56s)
02:09:56

[there's no gradient explosion so what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h09m59s)
02:09:59

[could do is instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m03s)
02:10:03

[of using whatever the default random in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m04s)
02:10:04

[it is for this matrix we could instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m08s)
02:10:08

[after we create our errand in is we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m11s)
02:10:11

[go into that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m14s)
02:10:14

[Erol in right and notice this right we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m15s)
02:10:15

[can go m dot RN n right and if we now go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m17s)
02:10:17

[like so we can get the docs for m dot R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m22s)
02:10:22

[and M right and as well as the arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m25s)
02:10:25

[for constructing it it also tells you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m29s)
02:10:29

[the inputs and outputs for calling the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m31s)
02:10:31

[layer and it also tells you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m33s)
02:10:33

[attributes and so it tells you there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m35s)
02:10:35

[something called weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m37s)
02:10:37

[H H and these are the learn about hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m39s)
02:10:39

[to hidden weights that's that square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m42s)
02:10:42

[matrix right so after we've constructed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m43s)
02:10:43

[our M we can just go in and say all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m46s)
02:10:46

[right m dot R and n dot weight h HL dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m49s)
02:10:49

[data that's the tensor dot copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m55s)
02:10:55

[underscore in place torch I that is I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h10m58s)
02:10:58

[for identity in case you are wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m03s)
02:11:03

[so this is an identity matrix of size n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m07s)
02:11:07

[hidden so this both puts into this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m11s)
02:11:11

[weight matrix and returns the identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m14s)
02:11:14

[matrix and so this was like actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m18s)
02:11:18

[Geoffrey Hinton paper was like hey you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m24s)
02:11:24

[know after it was it's 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m29s)
02:11:29

[so after recurrent neural Nets have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m31s)
02:11:31

[around for decades here's like hey gang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m34s)
02:11:34

[maybe we should just use the identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m38s)
02:11:38

[matrix to initialize this and like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m40s)
02:11:40

[actually turns out to work really well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m44s)
02:11:44

[and so that was a 2015 paper believe it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m46s)
02:11:46

[or not from the father of neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m49s)
02:11:49

[networks and so here is the here is our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m52s)
02:11:52

[implementation of his paper and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m54s)
02:11:54

[an important thing to know right when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m56s)
02:11:56

[very famous people like Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m58s)
02:11:58

[write a paper sometimes in entire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h11m59s)
02:11:59

[implementation of that paper looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m02s)
02:12:02

[one line of code okay so let's do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m04s)
02:12:04

[before we got point six one two five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m07s)
02:12:07

[seven we'll fit it with exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m10s)
02:12:10

[parameters and now we get 0.5 1 and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m12s)
02:12:12

[fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m16s)
02:12:16

[can keep training 0.50 so like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m16s)
02:12:16

[tweak really really really helped okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m19s)
02:12:19

[now one of the nice things about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m22s)
02:12:22

[tweak was before I could only use a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m24s)
02:12:24

[learning rate of one in x3 before it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m26s)
02:12:26

[started going crazy but after identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m29s)
02:12:29

[matrix I found I could use one in egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m32s)
02:12:32

[too because it's you know it's better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m34s)
02:12:34

[behaved weight initialization I found I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m36s)
02:12:36

[could use a higher learning rate okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m38s)
02:12:38

[and honestly these things you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m41s)
02:12:41

[increasingly we're trying to incorporate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m46s)
02:12:46

[into the defaults in first day I you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m49s)
02:12:49

[know you don't necessarily personally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m51s)
02:12:51

[need to actually know them but you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m53s)
02:12:53

[at this point we're still at a point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m56s)
02:12:56

[where you know most things in most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h12m59s)
02:12:59

[libraries most of the time don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m00s)
02:13:00

[great defaults it's good to know all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m02s)
02:13:02

[these little tricks it's also nice to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m03s)
02:13:03

[know if you want to improve something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m05s)
02:13:05

[what kind of tricks people have used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m07s)
02:13:07

[elsewhere because you can often borrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m09s)
02:13:09

[them yourself all right well that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m11s)
02:13:11

[end of the lesson today and so next week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m15s)
02:13:15

[we will look at this idea of a stateful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m17s)
02:13:17

[RNN that's going to keep this hidden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m20s)
02:13:20

[state around and then we're going to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m22s)
02:13:22

[back to looking at language models again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m23s)
02:13:23

[and then finally we're going to go all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m27s)
02:13:27

[the way back to computer vision and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m28s)
02:13:28

[learn about things like rez nets and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m30s)
02:13:30

[batch norm and all the tricks that were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m32s)
02:13:32

[in figured out in cats versus dogs see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m35s)
02:13:35

[you then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcLkfRrgoQ#t=02h13m38s)
