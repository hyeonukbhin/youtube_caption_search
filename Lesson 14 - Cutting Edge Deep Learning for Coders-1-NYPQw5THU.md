[the end about like what now but as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m14s)
00:00:14

[can see from what's increasingly the in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m18s)
00:00:18

[happening what next is very much about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m19s)
00:00:19

[you're with us rather than us we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m21s)
00:00:21

[leading you or telling you so you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m25s)
00:00:25

[Vera community now and we can figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m29s)
00:00:29

[these out together and obviously USF is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m31s)
00:00:31

[a one for Li to have yeah so for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m33s)
00:00:33

[this is the last of these lessons and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m40s)
00:00:40

[one of the things that is great to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m45s)
00:00:45

[this week was a terrific article in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m47s)

00:00:54

[our terrific students worth and focuses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h00m56s)
00:00:56

[on the great work of some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m00s)
00:01:00

[students that have come through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m01s)
00:01:01

[course and yeah so I wanted to say thank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m04s)
00:01:04

[you very much and congratulations on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m07s)
00:01:07

[this great article I hope everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m09s)
00:01:09

[check it out really beautifully written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m11s)
00:01:11

[as well and terrific stories I found a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m15s)
00:01:15

[quite inspiring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m18s)
00:01:18

[so today we are going to be talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m24s)
00:01:24

[about a couple things that we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m28s)
00:01:28

[to start with kind of time series and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m31s)
00:01:31

[structured data and time series I wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m34s)
00:01:34

[to start very briefly by talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m42s)
00:01:42

[something which I think you basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m44s)
00:01:44

[know how to do this is a fantastic paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m45s)
00:01:45

[because it is not side deepmind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m49s)
00:01:49

[nobody's heard of it it actually comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m52s)
00:01:52

[from the Children's Hospital of Los](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m55s)
00:01:55

[Angeles and believe it or not perhaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h01m56s)
00:01:56

00:02:22

[years they've been tracking every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m25s)
00:02:25

[electronic signal about how every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m27s)
00:02:27

[patient every kid in the hospital was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m31s)
00:02:31

[treated and what all their ongoing kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m33s)
00:02:33

[of sensor readings are and one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m35s)
00:02:35

[extraordinary things they do is when the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m40s)
00:02:40

[when the doctors there do rounds data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m42s)
00:02:42

[science has come with them like I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m44s)
00:02:44

[know anywhere in the world else in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m47s)
00:02:47

[world that happens and so a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m48s)
00:02:48

[months ago they released a draft for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m54s)
00:02:54

[this amazing paper where they talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m57s)
00:02:57

[about how they pulled out all this data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h02m59s)
00:02:59

[from the EMR and from the senses and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m03s)
00:03:03

[attempted to predict patient mortality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m05s)
00:03:05

[now the reason this is interesting is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m08s)
00:03:08

[that when a kid goes into the ICU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m10s)
00:03:10

[if if the morals start saying this kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m13s)
00:03:13

[looking like they might die then that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m16s)
00:03:16

[that's the thing that sets the alarms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m19s)
00:03:19

[going and everybody rushes over and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m21s)
00:03:21

[bucks you don't looking after them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[and they found that they built a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m24s)
00:03:24

[that was more accurate than any existing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m26s)
00:03:26

[model those existing models were built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m28s)
00:03:28

[on many years of deep clinical input and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m29s)
00:03:29

[are using RNN now this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m33s)
00:03:33

[time series data is is what I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m37s)
00:03:37

[refer to as a signal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m40s)
00:03:40

[hi I'm Terry's data so let's say you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m42s)
00:03:42

[got a series of like blood pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m45s)
00:03:45

[readings right so they might be you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m49s)
00:03:49

[they come in and their blood pressure is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m53s)
00:03:53

[kind of low and it's kind of all over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m54s)
00:03:54

[the place and then suddenly it shoots up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m56s)
00:03:56

[right then and then you know in addition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h03m58s)
00:03:58

[to that maybe there's other readings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m03s)
00:04:03

[such as like you know at which points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m05s)
00:04:05

[they receive some kind of medical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m11s)
00:04:11

[intervention you know there's one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m14s)
00:04:14

[one here and then there was like six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m16s)
00:04:16

[here and local so these kinds of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m18s)
00:04:18

[generally speaking the state of health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m22s)
00:04:22

[at time T is probably best predicted by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m26s)
00:04:26

[all of the various sensor readings at t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m29s)
00:04:29

[minus 1 and t minus 2 and 2 months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m31s)
00:04:31

[really great so in statistical terms we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m34s)
00:04:34

[would refer to that as autocorrelation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m37s)
00:04:37

[what are correlation in correlation 35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m40s)
00:04:40

[years right and for this kind of signal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m43s)
00:04:43

[I think it's very likely that an RNN is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m46s)
00:04:46

[the way to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m52s)
00:04:52

[obviously you could probably get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m54s)
00:04:54

[better result using a bi-directional RNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m55s)
00:04:55

[but that's not going to be any help to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m58s)
00:04:58

[you because you don't have to keep your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h04m59s)
00:04:59

[time period sentence right so be careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m01s)
00:05:01

[of this verb data linkage issues and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m04s)
00:05:04

[indeed this is what this team at the VT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m07s)
00:05:07

[curve at Children's Hospital where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m10s)
00:05:10

[central incisors use an R and n to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m12s)
00:05:12

[this state of the Amazon um I'm not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m14s)
00:05:14

[really going to teach you more about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m17s)
00:05:17

[this because basically you already know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m18s)
00:05:18

[how to do it ok that's it you can check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m20s)
00:05:20

[out the papers you'll see this almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m22s)
00:05:22

[nothing special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m24s)
00:05:24

[the only thing which was quite clever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m25s)
00:05:25

[was that their their sensor readings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m28s)
00:05:28

[were not necessarily equally spaced so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m33s)
00:05:33

[for example you know did they receive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m36s)
00:05:36

[some particular medical intervention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m40s)
00:05:40

[clearly they're very widely spaced and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m42s)
00:05:42

[they're not equally spaced so rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m44s)
00:05:44

[than having the RNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m47s)
00:05:47

[have basically a sequence of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m50s)
00:05:50

[interventions that gets fed to the R and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m55s)
00:05:55

[N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m58s)
00:05:58

[instead they actually have two things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h05m58s)
00:05:58

[one is the signal and the other is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m00s)
00:06:00

[time since the last signal is red so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m05s)
00:06:05

[each point at the R and if you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m09s)
00:06:09

[errand is basically just some function s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m11s)
00:06:11

[it's receiving two things that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m12s)
00:06:12

[receiving the signal at time T and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m14s)
00:06:14

[value of T observe right what is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m19s)
00:06:19

[time for the difference in time I wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m22s)
00:06:22

[in the last one but that doesn't require](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m25s)
00:06:25

[any different deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m28s)
00:06:28

[that's just concatenating one extra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m29s)
00:06:29

[thing in director and they actually show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m33s)
00:06:33

[kind of mathematically that this makes a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m35s)
00:06:35

[certain amount of sense as a way to deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m38s)
00:06:38

[with this and then they find empirically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m40s)
00:06:40

[that it does actually seem to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m42s)
00:06:42

[pretty well okay so I can't tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m44s)
00:06:44

[whether this is state-of-the-art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m48s)
00:06:48

[anything because I just haven't seen you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m49s)
00:06:49

[know deep comparative papers or any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m53s)
00:06:53

[competitions or anything that really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m56s)
00:06:56

[have this kind of data which is weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h06m58s)
00:06:58

[it'll have some kind of trend to it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h08m32s)

[think although like no one publishes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h11m29s)

[then through went through a sigmoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h12m18s)

[actually wrote a paper about this the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h12m36s)

[continuous variables basically get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h12m40s)
00:12:40

[directly into the desk where okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h12m42s)
00:12:42

[that's that's the structure of the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h12m44s)

[kind of 100 in whatever but then the AE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m06s)
00:13:06

[is entity embeddings so adding in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m10s)
00:13:10

[idea of using embeddings interestingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m13s)
00:13:13

[you can take the embedding trained by a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m16s)

[neural network and fit it into a KNN or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m19s)
00:13:19

[a random forest or a GBM and in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m22s)
00:13:22

[using embeddings with every one of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[things is way better and all of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m28s)
00:13:28

[things are any of anything other than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m32s)
00:13:32

[your own networks ok so that's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m34s)
00:13:34

[interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m37s)
00:13:37

[and then if you use the embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m37s)
00:13:37

[within your network you get the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m39s)
00:13:39

[results still so this actually it's kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m41s)
00:13:41

[of fascinating because training this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h13m47s)

[screwed something up and then I kept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m08s)

[know in your organization you know you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m17s)

[could think of as a categorical variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m23s)

[and once a month train a neural net with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m25s)

[want to create a model that incorporates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m39s)
00:14:39

[day a week or a store ID or customer ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[you know you can go grab the embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m45s)
00:14:45

[and so they're basically like word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[vectors but their customer that is in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m50s)
00:14:50

[store vectors and product vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m52s)
00:14:52

[so um I've never seen anybody write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m55s)
00:14:55

[about this other than this paper and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h14m59s)
00:14:59

[even in this paper they don't really get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m03s)
00:15:03

[to the the hugely important idea of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[what you could do with these inventing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m09s)
00:15:09

[what's the difference between a and B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m12s)
00:15:12

[and C is like different data types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[flowing in a and B and C are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m15s)
00:15:15

[prettiest yeah we're going to get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m18s)
00:15:18

[that in a moment so yeah basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m20s)
00:15:20

[different things is like a might be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[store ID beat might be the product a B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m24s)
00:15:24

[and C might be today of which one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m27s)
00:15:27

[really nice things that they did in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m33s)
00:15:33

[paper was to then draw some projections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m35s)
00:15:35

[some projections of some of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m38s)
00:15:38

[embeddings and they just use teasley it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m40s)
00:15:40

[doesn't really matter what projection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m42s)
00:15:42

[method is but is them some interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[ideas they talk on each state of Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m49s)
00:15:49

[deserve more votes and Germany and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m53s)
00:15:53

[did a projection of the embeddings from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m56s)
00:15:56

[the state field okay and here is those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h15m58s)
00:15:58

[projections and I've drawn around them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m02s)
00:16:02

[different colored circles and you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m05s)
00:16:05

[notice the different colored circles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m07s)
00:16:07

[exactly correspond to the different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[colored circles on a map of Germany now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m11s)
00:16:11

[this work just random embeddings trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m14s)
00:16:14

[with SGD trying to predict sales and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m18s)
00:16:18

[stores at ruffman and yet somehow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m22s)
00:16:22

[they've drawn a map of Germany so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m25s)
00:16:25

[obviously the reason why is because you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m29s)
00:16:29

[know things close to each other in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m31s)
00:16:31

[Germany have similar behaviour around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m32s)
00:16:32

[how they respond to events and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m34s)
00:16:34

[who buys what kinds of products and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m38s)
00:16:38

[on and so forth so that's like crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m40s)
00:16:40

[fascinating here it's the kind of bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m44s)
00:16:44

[picture every one of these dots is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m47s)
00:16:47

[distance between two stores and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m52s)
00:16:52

[shows the correlation between the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m57s)
00:16:57

[distance in embedding space versus the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h16m59s)
00:16:59

[actual distance between the stores right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m01s)
00:17:01

[and so you can basically see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[there's a strong correlation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m06s)
00:17:06

[the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[between things being close to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[in real life and close to each other in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m10s)
00:17:10

[these SGD train embeddings you have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m12s)
00:17:12

[couple more pictures those are all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m17s)
00:17:17

[lines drawn on top of mine but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m18s)
00:17:18

[everything else is just there from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m20s)
00:17:20

[paper on the left is days of the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m21s)
00:17:21

[inventing and you can see the days of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m24s)
00:17:24

[the week better near each other have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m26s)
00:17:26

[ended up embedded close together on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m27s)
00:17:27

[right each month of the year inventing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m30s)
00:17:30

[again same thing so and you can see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m32s)
00:17:32

[you know the weekend is clearly separate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m35s)
00:17:35

[so that that's where we're going to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m40s)
00:17:40

[to all right and I'm actually going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m45s)
00:17:45

[take you through the end-to-end process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m48s)
00:17:48

[and I rebuilt the I rebuilt the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m50s)
00:17:50

[end-to-end process from scratch and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m53s)
00:17:53

[tried to make it in as few lines of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m56s)
00:17:56

[as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m58s)
00:17:58

[because you know we just haven't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h17m59s)
00:17:59

[looked at any of these structured data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m02s)
00:18:02

[type problems before so you know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m05s)
00:18:05

[kind of a very different process and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m09s)
00:18:09

[know even a kind of a different set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m15s)
00:18:15

[all right so we import the usual stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m20s)
00:18:20

[when you're trying to do this stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m24s)
00:18:24

[yourself you'll find a tree or four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m26s)
00:18:26

[libraries we haven't used before so when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m29s)
00:18:29

[you hit something that says module not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[sound just pick install you can just get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m36s)
00:18:36

[install all these things if you were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m39s)
00:18:39

[pure piped we'll talk about them is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m41s)
00:18:41

[beginner okay so the data that comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m43s)
00:18:43

[from Carol comes down a bunch of CSV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m47s)
00:18:47

[files and I wrote a quick thing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m49s)
00:18:49

[combine some of those TSVs together and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m53s)
00:18:53

[this is one of those competitions where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m56s)
00:18:56

[people were allowed to use additional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h18m59s)
00:18:59

[external data as long as they were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[shared on the forum so the data I'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[share with you I'm going to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m06s)
00:19:06

[combine it all into one place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m08s)
00:19:08

[for you so I've commented these apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m11s)
00:19:11

[because the the stuff I'll give you will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m13s)
00:19:13

[already run this concatenation process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m15s)
00:19:15

[so the basic tables that you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m17s)
00:19:17

[get access to is the training set itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m19s)
00:19:19

[a list of stores a list of which stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m23s)
00:19:23

[each store is in a list of each the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m29s)
00:19:29

[abbreviation in the name of each stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m33s)
00:19:33

[in Germany a list of data from Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[Trends so like if you've used Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m38s)
00:19:38

[Trends you can basically see how Pixlr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m40s)
00:19:40

[keywords change over time I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m42s)
00:19:42

[actually and I actually know which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m44s)
00:19:44

[keywords they used but it'll somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m47s)
00:19:47

[found that there was in Google Trends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m51s)
00:19:51

[keywords that correlated well so we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m52s)
00:19:52

[got access to those some information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m55s)
00:19:55

[about the weather and then a test set so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h19m57s)
00:19:57

[I'm not sure that we've really used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m01s)
00:20:01

[pandas much if at all yet so let's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m03s)
00:20:03

[a bit about pandas so pandas lets us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m06s)
00:20:06

[take this kind of structured data and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m08s)
00:20:08

[manipulate it in similar ways to the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m11s)
00:20:11

[you would manipulated in a database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m13s)
00:20:13

[right so the first thing you do so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m15s)
00:20:15

[pandas the flight number items become MP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m17s)
00:20:17

[pandas tends to become pleading so PD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[htsb is going to return a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[a data frame okay so a data frame it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[like a database table if you use ours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m29s)
00:20:29

[called the setting so this red CSV is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m33s)
00:20:33

[going to return a data frame containing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m36s)
00:20:36

[the information from this CSV file and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m39s)
00:20:39

[we're going to go through each one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m43s)
00:20:43

[those table names and read the CSV so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m45s)
00:20:45

[this will end up this list comprehension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m47s)
00:20:47

[is going to return a list of data frames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[so I can now go ahead and display the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m54s)
00:20:54

[Hance so the first five rows from each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h20m59s)
00:20:59

[table and that's a good way to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m02s)
00:21:02

[get a sense of what these tables are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[okay so here's the the first one is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m06s)
00:21:06

[trading set so to some store on some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m09s)
00:21:09

[date they had some level of sales to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[some number of customers and they were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m20s)
00:21:20

[either open or closed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m23s)
00:21:23

[they are they had a promotion on all it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m24s)
00:21:24

00:21:26

[wasn't for steak and school and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m28s)
00:21:28

[some additional information of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m31s)
00:21:31

[annotation so that's the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m32s)
00:21:32

[information we have and then everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m35s)
00:21:35

[else we join on to that so for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m37s)
00:21:37

[for each store we can join up some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m41s)
00:21:41

[information some kind of categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m45s)
00:21:45

[variable what kind of store it is I have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m47s)
00:21:47

[no idea what this is it might be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m50s)
00:21:50

[different brand or something what kinds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m51s)
00:21:51

[of products do they carry again just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m54s)

[letter I don't know what it means that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m57s)
00:21:57

[maybe it's like summer electronics maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h21m58s)
00:21:58

[summer supermarkets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m00s)
00:22:00

[maybe summer full-spectrum how far away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m01s)
00:22:01

[is the nearest competitor and what year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m06s)
00:22:06

[and month did the competitor open for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m11s)
00:22:11

[business notice that sometimes the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[competitor open for business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m17s)
00:22:17

[quite linked in the game like like later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m19s)
00:22:19

[than some of the data were actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m22s)
00:22:22

[looking at so that's going to be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m24s)
00:22:24

[little bit confusing and then there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m26s)
00:22:26

[thing called promo - which as far as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m29s)
00:22:29

[understand it is basically is this a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m31s)
00:22:31

[store which has some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m33s)
00:22:33

[standard promotion training going on and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m35s)
00:22:35

[so you can see here that these are this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m38s)
00:22:38

[store has standard promotions in January](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m40s)
00:22:40

[April July and October so that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m42s)
00:22:42

[stores we also know if each store what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m46s)
00:22:46

[state they're in based on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m51s)
00:22:51

[abbreviation and then we can find out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m52s)
00:22:52

[for each state what is the name of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m55s)
00:22:55

[state and then for each this is slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h22m56s)
00:22:56

[weird this is a state abbreviation the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m01s)
00:23:01

[last two letters in this state during](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m02s)
00:23:02

[this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m05s)
00:23:05

[this was the Google trend data for some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m06s)
00:23:06

[keyword I'm not sure what key what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m09s)
00:23:09

[was for this state name on this date is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m11s)
00:23:11

[the temperature dew point so forth and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m18s)
00:23:18

[then finally here's the test set it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m24s)
00:23:24

[identical to the training set but we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m26s)
00:23:26

[don't have the number of customers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m28s)
00:23:28

[we don't have the number of sales okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m29s)
00:23:29

[so like this is a pretty standard kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m33s)
00:23:33

[of industry data set it's you know we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m36s)
00:23:36

[got something we've got a kind of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m39s)
00:23:39

[central table various tables related to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m40s)
00:23:40

[that and some things representing time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m43s)
00:23:43

[periods or plan points one of the nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m46s)
00:23:46

[things you can do in pandas is to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m50s)
00:23:50

[this pandas summary module and called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m54s)
00:23:54

[data frame summary for a table summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h23m57s)
00:23:57

[and that will return a whole bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m00s)
00:24:00

[information about every field so I'm not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m02s)
00:24:02

[going to go through all of it in detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m05s)
00:24:05

[but you can see if example for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m06s)
00:24:06

[number for the sales you know on average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m08s)
00:24:08

[fifty eight hundred sales standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m10s)
00:24:10

[deviation of thirty eight hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m13s)
00:24:13

[sometimes sales heads all the way down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m14s)
00:24:14

[to zero sometimes all the way up to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m16s)
00:24:16

[forty one thousand there's no missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m17s)
00:24:17

[details that's good to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m21s)
00:24:21

[so this is kind of thing that's quick to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m24s)
00:24:24

[kind of scroll through and identify you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m26s)
00:24:26

[know okay competition token since month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m28s)
00:24:28

[is missing about a third at the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m30s)
00:24:30

[it's good to know there's 12 unique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m33s)
00:24:33

[states that might be worth checking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m38s)
00:24:38

[because there's actually 16 things in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m43s)
00:24:43

[our state table for some reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m45s)
00:24:45

[um Google trend data is never missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m47s)
00:24:47

[that's good the ear goes from 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[through 2016 the weather data is never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h24m56s)
00:24:56

[missing and then is our test set you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m02s)
00:25:02

[know this is the kind of things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m09s)
00:25:09

[might screw up a model is like actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m10s)
00:25:10

[sometimes the test set is missing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m12s)
00:25:12

[information about whether that store was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m13s)
00:25:13

[open or not that's going to be careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m15s)
00:25:15

[of okay so we can take that list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m17s)
00:25:17

[tables and just see structure it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[into a whole bunch of different table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m23s)
00:25:23

[names find out how big the training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m24s)
00:25:24

[is find out how big the test set is and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m27s)
00:25:27

[then you know with this kind of problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m30s)
00:25:30

[there's going to be a whole bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m35s)
00:25:35

[data cleaning and I want your picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m37s)
00:25:37

[engineering and so you know neural nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m40s)
00:25:40

[don't make any of that go away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m44s)
00:25:44

[particularly because we're using this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[style of neural net where you know we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[basically feeding in a whole bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m52s)
00:25:52

[separate continuous and categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m53s)
00:25:53

[variables so simplify things a bit to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m55s)
00:25:55

[take holidays into billions and then I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h25m59s)
00:25:59

[going to join all of these tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m03s)
00:26:03

[together right so I always use a default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m04s)
00:26:04

[join type of an alpha join right so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m11s)
00:26:11

[can see here this is how we join in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m14s)
00:26:14

[pendants we say table don't merge table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m17s)
00:26:17

[two and then to make a left outer join](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m21s)
00:26:21

[how it will left and then you say okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m23s)
00:26:23

[what's the name of the field that you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m26s)
00:26:26

[going to join on the left hand side what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m28s)
00:26:28

[are the fields are going to join on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m30s)
00:26:30

[right hand side and then if both tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m31s)
00:26:31

[have some fields with the same name what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[are you going to Suffolk so fields with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m38s)
00:26:38

[so the left hand side we're looking to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m41s)
00:26:41

[add any suffix on the right hand side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m43s)
00:26:43

[we'll put in underscore Y so you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m45s)
00:26:45

[again I try to refactor things as much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m48s)
00:26:48

[as I can so we're going to join lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m50s)
00:26:50

[things let's create one function to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m52s)
00:26:52

[the joining and then we can call a lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m53s)
00:26:53

[of terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m55s)
00:26:55

[was there any fields or referring to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h26m59s)
00:26:59

[same value but named different king I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m03s)
00:27:03

[look at I saw no but it and it wouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m06s)
00:27:06

[matter too much if there were because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m11s)
00:27:11

[you know when we run the model no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m13s)
00:27:13

[problem I think we have a question in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[the forum would you liken the use of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m19s)
00:27:19

[embeddings from a neural network to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m22s)
00:27:22

[extraction of implicit features or can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m24s)
00:27:24

[they think of it more like what a PCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m27s)
00:27:27

[would do like dimensionality reduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m29s)
00:27:29

[let's talk about it more when we get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m36s)
00:27:36

[there but I mean basically when you deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m38s)
00:27:38

[with categorical variables in any kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m41s)
00:27:41

[of model you have to decide what to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m43s)
00:27:43

[with them right and one of my favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m45s)
00:27:45

[data scientists or pair of them actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m50s)

[who very nearly neighbors of Rachel and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m54s)

[mine have this fantastic R package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h27m56s)
00:27:56

[called V trees which has like a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m00s)
00:28:00

[state of the art approaches to to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m05s)
00:28:05

[dealing with stuff like categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m11s)
00:28:11

[variable encoding and so you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m12s)
00:28:12

[the obvious way to do categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[variable encoding is to just do a 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m21s)

00:28:25

[everybody puts it into their gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m27s)

[whatever but one of the things that V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m31s)

[tree does is it has some much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m34s)
00:28:34

[interesting techniques so for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m39s)
00:28:39

[such as John and Nina's package you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m42s)
00:28:42

[you could look at the univariate mean of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m47s)
00:28:47

[sales for you know each day of week and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m52s)
00:28:52

[you could kind of encode day of week you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m55s)
00:28:55

[know using a continuous variable which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h28m58s)
00:28:58

[rested the mean and sales but then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m01s)
00:29:01

[have to think about like oh well would I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m03s)
00:29:03

[take that mean from the trading set or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m05s)
00:29:05

[the test set or the validation set how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[do I avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m09s)
00:29:09

[kidding you know there's all kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m10s)
00:29:10

[complex statistical battlekey's to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m12s)
00:29:12

[about that lead tree handles all this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m16s)
00:29:16

[stuff automatically now that is you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m18s)
00:29:18

[that there's a lot of great techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m23s)
00:29:23

[that they're kind of complicated and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[the end they tend to make a whole bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[of assumptions about like linearity or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m30s)
00:29:30

[univariate correlations or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m32s)

00:29:35

[SGG to learn how to deal with it you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m40s)
00:29:40

[know just like we do when we build an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m44s)
00:29:44

[NLP model or or a laboratory filtering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m46s)
00:29:46

[model you know we provide some initially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m51s)
00:29:51

[random embeddings and the you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h29m53s)

[very or words dairy or in enough so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m01s)
00:30:01

[know this is a to me the ultimate pure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m05s)
00:30:05

[technique and of course the other nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m08s)
00:30:08

[thing about embeddings is we get to pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m10s)
00:30:10

[the dimensionality of the embedding so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m12s)
00:30:12

[we can decide how much complexity and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[how much learning are we going to put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m17s)
00:30:17

[into each of the categorical variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m19s)
00:30:19

[and what we'll see how to do that in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m22s)
00:30:22

[moment okay so one complexity was that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[the because the weather yes the weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m31s)
00:30:31

[uses the name of the stage rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m39s)
00:30:39

[the radiation of the stage so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[just go ahead and join whether two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m44s)
00:30:44

[states to get the abbreviation the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m47s)
00:30:47

[Google Trends information about the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m51s)
00:30:51

[you know week from from A to B we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m52s)
00:30:52

[split that apart you can see here one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h30m55s)
00:30:55

[the things that happens in the Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m01s)

[trend data is that one of the states is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m05s)
00:31:05

[called ni or L so the rest of the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m06s)
00:31:06

[is called HD konna ni so this is a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m09s)
00:31:09

[opportunity to learn about pandas in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m12s)
00:31:12

[so pattered indexing first the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m14s)
00:31:14

[you're watching uses spot ax method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m18s)
00:31:18

[right and the dot IX method is your kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m20s)
00:31:20

[of general indexing methods and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m25s)
00:31:25

[going to take two things a list of rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m26s)
00:31:26

[to select and a list of columns the flat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m29s)
00:31:29

[and you can use it in kind of pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m31s)
00:31:31

[standard intuitive way this is a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m33s)
00:31:33

[like numpy right this here is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m35s)
00:31:35

[return a list of boolean which things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m37s)
00:31:37

[are in this state and if you pass the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m41s)
00:31:41

[list of boolean to the pandas root](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m43s)
00:31:43

[selector it will just return the rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m46s)
00:31:46

[where that ball in is true so therefore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m47s)
00:31:47

[this is just going to return the rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m50s)
00:31:50

[from Google trend where Google Translate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m53s)
00:31:53

[state is and I and then the second thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m55s)
00:31:55

[we pass in is a list of columns in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h31m57s)
00:31:57

[case we just want one column and one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m01s)
00:32:01

[very important thing to remember again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m02s)
00:32:02

[just like lump a you can put this kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m04s)
00:32:04

[of thing on the left hand side of an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m07s)
00:32:07

[equal sign in computer science we call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m08s)
00:32:08

[it an L value so you can use it as an L](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m10s)
00:32:10

[value so we can take this state field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m12s)
00:32:12

[for things which equal to NI and change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m15s)
00:32:15

[their value to this okay so this is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m19s)
00:32:19

[a very nice simple technique that you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m21s)
00:32:21

[use all the time independence both for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m26s)
00:32:26

[looking at things and for changing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[things excuse me we have a few questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m31s)
00:32:31

[and one is in this particular example do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m39s)
00:32:39

[you think the granularity of the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m42s)
00:32:42

[matter is in per day or per week it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m44s)
00:32:44

[one better than the other yeah I mean I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m47s)
00:32:47

[would want to have the lower granularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m52s)
00:32:52

[so that I can capture that I mean the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m56s)
00:32:56

[ideally you at one time as well it kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h32m59s)
00:32:59

[of depends how the organization is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m03s)
00:33:03

[to use it right like today what are they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m06s)
00:33:06

[going to do with this information it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m08s)
00:33:08

[probably for like purchasing and stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m10s)
00:33:10

[so maybe they don't care about an hourly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m11s)
00:33:11

[level there clearly the difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[between Sunday sales and Wednesday sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m16s)
00:33:16

[will be quite significant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m19s)
00:33:19

[yeah it's mainly a kind of business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m20s)
00:33:20

[context or domain understanding question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m24s)
00:33:24

[another question is do you know if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m27s)
00:33:27

[there's any work that compares for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m29s)
00:33:29

[structured data supervised DIMM beddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m30s)
00:33:30

[like these two embeddings that come from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m33s)
00:33:33

[an unsupervised paradigm such as an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m35s)
00:33:35

[autoencoder it seems like you get more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m37s)
00:33:37

[useful for prediction embeddings with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[the former case but if you wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m41s)
00:33:41

[general-purpose embeddings you might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m43s)
00:33:43

[prefer the latter yeah I mean I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m45s)
00:33:45

[you guys are aware of my feelings that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m47s)
00:33:47

[orderly owners you know it's like giving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m48s)
00:33:48

[up in life you know you can always come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m51s)
00:33:51

[up with a lost function that's more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m55s)
00:33:55

[interesting than an autoencoder loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m56s)
00:33:56

[notion basically I would be very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m57s)
00:33:57

[surprised if embeddings that came from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h33m59s)
00:33:59

[sales model were not more useful for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m01s)
00:34:01

[just about everything there's something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m05s)
00:34:05

[from the unsupervised model that these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m06s)
00:34:06

[these things are easily tested and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m09s)
00:34:09

[you do find a model that they don't work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m11s)
00:34:11

[as well with and you can come up with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[different set of supervisors embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m14s)
00:34:14

[for that model I'm in a there's also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m16s)
00:34:16

[just to note that dot IX is deprecated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m18s)
00:34:18

[and we should use dot Logan said okay I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m21s)
00:34:21

[was going to mention pandas is changing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m24s)
00:34:24

[a lot and because I've been running this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m26s)
00:34:26

[course I have not been keeping track of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m30s)
00:34:30

[the recent versions of pandas so thank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m31s)
00:34:31

[you so that should be Google trend oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m33s)
00:34:33

[look there's impendence there's a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m39s)
00:34:39

[page called advanced indexing methods I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m43s)
00:34:43

[don't find the pandas documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m44s)
00:34:44

[terribly clear to be honest but there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m47s)
00:34:47

[a fantastic book by the author of pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m48s)
00:34:48

[called pison for data analysis there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m50s)
00:34:50

[a new edition out and it covers pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m54s)
00:34:54

[done primarily of whatever yeah that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h34m59s)
00:34:59

[understand tenders to the documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m07s)
00:35:07

[is a bit of a nightmare and it keeps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m09s)

[changing so the new version has all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m11s)

[new stuff it oh yeah with these kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m13s)
00:35:13

[indexing methods pandas tries really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m16s)
00:35:16

[hard to be intuitive which means that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m19s)
00:35:19

[like quite often you'll read the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m22s)
00:35:22

[documentation for these methods and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m23s)
00:35:23

[will say like you know if if you pass it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m25s)
00:35:25

[a boolean it'll behave in this way if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m28s)
00:35:28

[you pass it a float this way if it's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m30s)

[index](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m32s)
00:35:32

[it this way unless this other thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m33s)
00:35:33

[happens and like I don't find it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m36s)
00:35:36

[intuitive at all because in the end I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m39s)
00:35:39

[need to know how something works in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m40s)
00:35:40

[order to use it correctly and so you end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m41s)
00:35:41

[up having to remember this huge list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[things right so this is I think pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m45s)
00:35:45

[is great but this is one thing to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m47s)
00:35:47

[very careful of is to really make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m48s)
00:35:48

[you understand how all these indexing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m52s)
00:35:52

[methods actually work and I know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m54s)
00:35:54

[Rachel's laughing because you've been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m55s)

[Augusta or you want to go through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[another question when you use embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m03s)
00:36:03

[from a supervised model in another model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m06s)
00:36:06

[do you have to worry about data leakage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m08s)
00:36:08

[yes you always have to worry about their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m14s)
00:36:14

[leash I think that's a great point you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m17s)
00:36:17

[know I I think I've anything to add to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m19s)
00:36:19

[that you can figure out easily enough of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m22s)
00:36:22

[his data leakage so yeah but so it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m24s)
00:36:24

[great question and you need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m32s)
00:36:32

[definitely think to think about okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m34s)
00:36:34

[there's this kind of standard set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m40s)
00:36:40

[steps that I take for every single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m44s)
00:36:44

[structured machine learning model I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m48s)
00:36:48

[and one of those is every time I see SH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m51s)
00:36:51

[I always do this but I always create for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m54s)
00:36:54

[more feelings the year the month of here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h36m59s)
00:36:59

[the week of year and the day of whim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m02s)
00:37:02

[this is um you know something which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m07s)
00:37:07

[should be like automatically built into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m12s)
00:37:12

[every data loader I feel it's so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m15s)
00:37:15

[important because you know these are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m18s)
00:37:18

[kinds of structures that you see and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m20s)
00:37:20

[once every single baek's has got this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m23s)
00:37:23

[added to it you're doing great so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m25s)
00:37:25

[can see that I add that into all of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m28s)
00:37:28

[tables that have a date field and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m34s)
00:37:34

[we'll have that for now on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m38s)
00:37:38

[so then we go ahead and do what with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m41s)
00:37:41

[these out of joints and you'll see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m43s)
00:37:43

[the first thing I do after every outer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m46s)
00:37:46

[join is check whether the thing I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m49s)
00:37:49

[joined with has any nodes but so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m53s)
00:37:53

[even if you're sure that these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h37m57s)
00:37:57

[match perfectly I still never ever do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m01s)
00:38:01

[in a joint right through the outer join](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m04s)
00:38:04

[and then check the Noles and that way at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m07s)
00:38:07

[anything changes ever or if you ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m09s)
00:38:09

[make a mistake one of these things will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m11s)
00:38:11

[not be zero now if this was happening in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m14s)
00:38:14

[a production process you know this would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m17s)
00:38:17

[be this would be an assert this would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m19s)
00:38:19

[you know emailing Henry at 2:00 a.m. to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m21s)
00:38:21

[say like you know something you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m24s)
00:38:24

[relying on it's not working the way it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[was meant to walk out so that's why I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m28s)
00:38:28

[always do it this way so you can see I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m33s)
00:38:33

[just basically joining my training to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m36s)
00:38:36

[everything else until it's all in there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m39s)
00:38:39

[together in one big thing okay so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m43s)
00:38:43

[table everything drawing together is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m49s)
00:38:49

[called join and then I do a whole bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m50s)
00:38:50

[more thinking about what I'll enjoy the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m54s)
00:38:54

[thinking of the people that won this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m57s)
00:38:57

[competition and I replicated their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h38m58s)
00:38:58

[results from scratch you know think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m00s)
00:39:00

[about what are all the other things you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m03s)
00:39:03

[might want to do with these days so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m05s)
00:39:05

[competition open we notice before a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m07s)
00:39:07

[third of the time they're empty so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m10s)
00:39:10

[just fill in the empties with some kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m13s)
00:39:13

[of sentinel value because a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m16s)
00:39:16

[machine learning systems don't like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m19s)
00:39:19

[missing values fill in the missing month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m21s)
00:39:21

[with some Sentinel value again keep on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m25s)
00:39:25

[filling in missing data so fill in a is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m28s)
00:39:28

[a really important thing to be aware of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m31s)
00:39:31

[retro is the filling in the month with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m35s)
00:39:35

[one isn't one and a real-valued it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m44s)
00:39:44

[a problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m48s)
00:39:48

[the answer is yes it is the problem but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m52s)
00:39:52

[in this case they happen to know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m55s)
00:39:55

[every time year is empty month is also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h39m58s)
00:39:58

[empty and we only ever use both of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m01s)
00:40:01

[together so any model whether it be tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m03s)
00:40:03

[based or neural net based or whatever is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m05s)
00:40:05

[going to take advantage of that of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m07s)
00:40:07

[fact so yeah probably would have been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m10s)
00:40:10

[secretive differently innocence okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m13s)
00:40:13

[we don't really care actually when the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m18s)
00:40:18

[competitions door was open what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m22s)
00:40:22

[really care about is how long is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m24s)
00:40:24

[between when they were open and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m26s)
00:40:26

[particular row that we're looking at you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m28s)
00:40:28

[know the sales on the 2nd of February](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m30s)
00:40:30

[2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m32s)
00:40:32

[how long was it between second of every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[2014 and when the competition opened so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[you can see here we use this a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m39s)
00:40:39

[important apply function which just run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m41s)
00:40:41

[the Python function on every row of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[data frame and in this case the function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m49s)
00:40:49

[is to create a new date from the opens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m52s)
00:40:52

[in here and the open since month we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m57s)
00:40:57

[just going to assume that at the middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m58s)
00:40:58

[of month and that's our competition open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h40m59s)
00:40:59

[sense and then we can get our days open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m03s)
00:41:03

[by just doing a subtract in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m05s)
00:41:05

[pandas every date field has this special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m11s)
00:41:11

[metrical DT property which is what all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m15s)
00:41:15

[the then you know days month year all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m18s)
00:41:18

[that stuff is sits inside this little DT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m21s)
00:41:21

[property now sometimes as I mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m23s)
00:41:23

[the competition actually opens later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m30s)
00:41:30

[than the particular observation we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m33s)
00:41:33

[looking at so that will gives us a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m35s)
00:41:35

[negative so if we replace our negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m37s)
00:41:37

[to zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m39s)
00:41:39

[um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m40s)
00:41:40

[we're going to use an embedding for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m43s)
00:41:43

[so that's why we replace days open with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m47s)
00:41:47

[months open so we have less values yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m50s)
00:41:50

[I mean I didn't actually try replacing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h41m57s)
00:41:57

[this with a continuous variable I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m00s)
00:42:00

[suspect it wouldn't make too much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m02s)
00:42:02

[difference but you know this is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m03s)
00:42:03

[they do in order to make the embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m06s)
00:42:06

[again not too big they replace anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m10s)
00:42:10

[that was bigger than two years with two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m13s)
00:42:13

[years okay so there's our unique values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m15s)
00:42:15

[now every time you do something print](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m21s)
00:42:21

[something out to make sure that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m23s)
00:42:23

[thing you thought you did is what you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m24s)
00:42:24

[actually do it's much easier if we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m26s)
00:42:26

[using Excel because like you see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[straightaway what we're doing so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m30s)
00:42:30

[Python you know this is the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[stuff that you have to really be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m35s)
00:42:35

[rigorous about checking your work at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[every step you know when I build stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m39s)
00:42:39

[like this I generally make you know at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m43s)
00:42:43

[least one error in every cell so check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m46s)
00:42:46

[carefully okay do the same thing for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m50s)
00:42:50

[promo days turn those into weeks yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h42m53s)
00:42:53

[okay so that's some basic pre-processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m00s)
00:43:00

[you get the idea of how pandas works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[socially so the next thing that they did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m04s)
00:43:04

[in the paper was some again some a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m08s)
00:43:08

[common kind of time series feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m15s)
00:43:15

[manipulation one to be aware of which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m17s)
00:43:17

[they basically wanted to say okay every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[time there's a promotion very time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m25s)
00:43:25

[there's a holiday I want to create some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m29s)
00:43:29

[additional fields to every you know for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m31s)
00:43:31

[every one of our training set roads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m35s)
00:43:35

[which is on a particular date which it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m36s)
00:43:36

[like on that date how long is it until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m38s)
00:43:38

[the next holiday how long was it until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m40s)
00:43:40

[the previous holiday how long was it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m43s)
00:43:43

[until the next promotion how long is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[since the previous promotion so if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m47s)
00:43:47

[basically create those fields you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m49s)
00:43:49

[this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m54s)
00:43:54

[this is the kind of thing which is super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m55s)
00:43:55

[difficult for any GBM or random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h43m57s)
00:43:57

[or neural net to figure out how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m00s)
00:44:00

[calculate itself right it's not a you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m02s)
00:44:02

[know there's no obvious sort of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m06s)
00:44:06

[mathematical function that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m08s)
00:44:08

[build on its own so we've this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m09s)
00:44:09

[kind of feature engineering we have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m11s)
00:44:11

[do in order to allow us to use these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[kinds of techniques effectively on time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m15s)
00:44:15

[series data so a lot of people who work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m18s)
00:44:18

[with time series data are particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m21s)
00:44:21

[in academia outside of industry they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m26s)
00:44:26

[just not aware of the fact that the you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m27s)
00:44:27

[know the state of the art approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m30s)
00:44:30

[really involve all these heuristics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m32s)
00:44:32

[right you know separating out your dates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m35s)
00:44:35

[into their components turning everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m38s)
00:44:38

[you can into durations before backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m40s)
00:44:40

[and also doing a bunch of you'll see in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m45s)
00:44:45

[a moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m47s)
00:44:47

[running averages so you know when I used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m47s)
00:44:47

[to do a lot of this kind of work I had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m52s)
00:44:52

[you know a bunch of library functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[that I would run on every file that came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h44m58s)
00:44:58

[in and would automatically do these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m01s)
00:45:01

[things for every combination of dates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m03s)
00:45:03

[you know so this thing of like how long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m05s)
00:45:05

[until the next promotion how long the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m10s)
00:45:10

[previous promotion is not easy to do in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m11s)
00:45:11

[any database system pretty much or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m16s)
00:45:16

[indeed in pandas because generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m20s)
00:45:20

[speaking these kind of systems are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m22s)
00:45:22

[looking for relationships between tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m24s)
00:45:24

[but we're trying to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m25s)
00:45:25

[relationships between rows okay so I had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m27s)
00:45:27

[to create a tiny little simple little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m30s)
00:45:30

[class to do this so basically what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m33s)
00:45:33

[happens is let's say I'm looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m36s)
00:45:36

[school holiday right so I sort my data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m39s)
00:45:39

[frame by store and then by date and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m42s)
00:45:42

[call this little function called add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m47s)
00:45:47

[elapsed school holiday after and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m48s)
00:45:48

[does add elapsed to an elapsed is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m53s)
00:45:53

[to create an instance of this class or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m55s)
00:45:55

[elapsed and it's going to be poor with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h45m59s)
00:45:59

[school holiday so what this class is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m02s)
00:46:02

[going to do we're going to be calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m05s)
00:46:05

[this apply function again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m06s)
00:46:06

[so I'm just going to run them every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m08s)
00:46:08

[single row and it's got a call my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m09s)
00:46:09

[elapsed class yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m13s)
00:46:13

[for every row so I'm going to go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m14s)
00:46:14

[every row in order a store in order date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[and then try to find how long has it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m20s)
00:46:20

[been since the last school holiday so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m23s)
00:46:23

[when I create this object I just have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m26s)
00:46:26

[keep track of okay what field is it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m30s)
00:46:30

[school holidays initialize when was the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m32s)
00:46:32

[last time we saw a school holiday and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m36s)
00:46:36

[the answer is we have interested you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m39s)
00:46:39

[know initialize it's another number and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m41s)
00:46:41

[we also have to know like each time we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m44s)
00:46:44

[like cross over to a new store like when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m47s)
00:46:47

[we cross over means to all with exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[reinitialized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m50s)
00:46:50

[so the previous store was zero so every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m51s)
00:46:51

[time we call catch we basically check ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m54s)
00:46:54

[have we crossed over to a new store and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m57s)
00:46:57

[if so just initialize those are those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h46m59s)
00:46:59

[things back again and then we just say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m02s)
00:47:02

[ok if this a school holiday if so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m05s)
00:47:05

[the last time you saw a school holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m10s)
00:47:10

[is today and then finally return how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m11s)
00:47:11

[long is it the train today and the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m16s)
00:47:16

[time you saw a school holiday right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m18s)
00:47:18

[it's basically this class is a way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m20s)
00:47:20

[keeping track of kind of to memory about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[like when do they last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m27s)
00:47:27

[see these observation so I've been by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m28s)
00:47:28

[this calling EF not apply it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m31s)
00:47:31

[keep track of this to every single row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m33s)
00:47:33

[and so that I can call that for school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m36s)
00:47:36

[holiday after and before the only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m38s)
00:47:38

[difference being that I four before I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m41s)
00:47:41

[just sort my dates in descending order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m43s)
00:47:43

[state holiday and promo ok so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m46s)
00:47:46

[going to add in the end six fields how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m51s)
00:47:51

[long until and how long since the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m54s)
00:47:54

[school holidays state holidays and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m56s)
00:47:56

[promotion and then there's a question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h47m58s)
00:47:58

[our two questions and one asking is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m02s)
00:48:02

[similar to a windowing function look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[what we're about to do a window resume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m10s)
00:48:10

[and then is there a reason to think that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m11s)
00:48:11

[the current approach would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m13s)
00:48:13

[problematic with sparse data but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m15s)
00:48:15

[see why that I'm not sure I quite follow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m20s)
00:48:20

[along at all so we don't care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m23s)
00:48:23

[absolute DS we care about time dentist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m25s)
00:48:25

[between events we care about two things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m29s)
00:48:29

[we can we do care about the date that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m31s)
00:48:31

[we've already let's hold out the it we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m33s)
00:48:33

[don't care about the like what year is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m35s)
00:48:35

[Earth whatever we could is yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m37s)
00:48:37

[and we also care about the elapsed time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m39s)
00:48:39

[between the the data and predicting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m42s)
00:48:42

[sales for and the previous and missed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m47s)
00:48:47

[appearances okay and then windowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m49s)
00:48:49

[functions to do another room yes and for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m53s)
00:48:53

[the features that are time until an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m56s)
00:48:56

[event how do you deal with that given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h48m58s)
00:48:58

[that not you might not know when the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m01s)
00:49:01

[last event is in the data well all I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m03s)
00:49:03

[is I've sort of sorted descending right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m07s)
00:49:07

[and then we initialize last with a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m11s)
00:49:11

[of number so basically when we then go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m16s)
00:49:16

[subtract here we are subtracted it tries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m20s)
00:49:20

[to subtract not a number will end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m23s)
00:49:23

[with an all right so basically anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m25s)
00:49:25

[that's unknown time because it's at one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m28s)
00:49:28

[end or the other is going to end up null](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m31s)
00:49:31

[which is why we there is later on but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m32s)
00:49:32

[shortly and we're going to replace those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m38s)
00:49:38

[noises with zeros okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m40s)
00:49:40

[pandas have this slightly strange way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m45s)
00:49:45

[thinking about indexes but what to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m48s)
00:49:48

[used to define at any point you can call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m50s)
00:49:50

[data frames octet index and pass in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m52s)
00:49:52

[field you don't have to just kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m57s)
00:49:57

[remember what field you have as the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h49m59s)
00:49:59

[index because quite a few methods in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m01s)
00:50:01

[pandas use they're kind of currently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m03s)
00:50:03

[active index by default and of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m05s)
00:50:05

[things will run faster when you do stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m08s)
00:50:08

[they're currently active index thumb and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m10s)
00:50:10

[you can pass multiple fields in which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m13s)
00:50:13

[actually end up with a multiple key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m15s)
00:50:15

[index](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m17s)
00:50:17

[okay so the next thing we do is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m19s)
00:50:19

[windowing function so a windowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[function in pandas we can use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[rolling it's like a rolling mean rolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m27s)
00:50:27

[mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[that's whatever you like so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[basically said all right let's take our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[data frame with the columns we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m37s)
00:50:37

[interested in school holiday state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m40s)
00:50:40

[holiday and Provo and we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m42s)
00:50:42

[keep track of like how many holidays are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m44s)
00:50:44

[there in the next week and the previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m46s)
00:50:46

[week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m49s)
00:50:49

[how many promos are there in the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m50s)
00:50:50

[week of previously so to do that we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[sort by date group by store and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h50m58s)
00:50:58

[rolling will it be applied to each group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m05s)
00:51:05

[so within each group create a rolling 7d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[son okay so it's kind of like you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m12s)
00:51:12

[it's the kind of notation I'm never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m19s)
00:51:19

[likely to remember you know if it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m23s)
00:51:23

[just look it up and this is how you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m25s)
00:51:25

[like group by type stuff Candace's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m27s)
00:51:27

[actually has quite a lot of time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m31s)
00:51:31

[functions when this rolling function is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m34s)
00:51:34

[one of the motions for one's you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m37s)
00:51:37

[where the Kinney had a background with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m38s)
00:51:38

[the quantitative memory says directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m40s)
00:51:40

[and so you know quads love their time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m42s)
00:51:42

[serious functions I think that was a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m44s)
00:51:44

[of the history of dependence so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m46s)
00:51:46

[you're interested in time series stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m49s)
00:51:49

[you'll find a lot of times recess and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m50s)
00:51:50

[pendants okay one helpful parameter that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h51m52s)
00:51:52

[sits inside a lot of methods is in place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m03s)
00:52:03

[equals true that means that rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m05s)
00:52:05

[returning a new data frame with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m08s)
00:52:08

[change made it changes the data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m11s)
00:52:11

[you already have and when your data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m13s)
00:52:13

[frames are quite big this is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m16s)
00:52:16

[save a lot of time in memory so that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m17s)
00:52:17

[good little trick to know about okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m19s)
00:52:19

[now we've merge all these together and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m23s)
00:52:23

[we can now see that we've got all these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m24s)
00:52:24

[after school holiday before school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m27s)
00:52:27

[holiday and our backward and forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m29s)
00:52:29

[running means um and then we join that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m31s)
00:52:31

[up to our original data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m38s)
00:52:38

[and here we have our final result so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m41s)
00:52:41

[there it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m46s)
00:52:46

[you know we ended up we started out with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m48s)
00:52:48

[a pretty small set of field from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m50s)
00:52:50

[training set but we've done this feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m52s)
00:52:52

[engineering and this feature engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m55s)
00:52:55

[is not arbitrary like although I didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h52m59s)
00:52:59

[create this solution I was just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m01s)
00:53:01

[reimplemented the solution that was came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m03s)
00:53:03

[from the competition so please get us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m07s)
00:53:07

[this is nearly exactly the set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m12s)
00:53:12

[picture engineering steps I would have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[done like it's just a really standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m16s)
00:53:16

[way of thinking about a time series okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m18s)
00:53:18

[so you know you can definitely borrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m20s)
00:53:20

[these ideas pretty closely ok so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m24s)
00:53:24

[that we've got that you know we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m32s)
00:53:32

[this this table we've done our feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m36s)
00:53:36

[engineering we now want to feed it into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m40s)
00:53:40

[a neural network so to feed it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m45s)
00:53:45

[neural network we have to do a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m49s)
00:53:49

[things the categorical variables have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m51s)
00:53:51

[be turned into 100 coded variables or at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m53s)
00:53:53

[least in two contiguous integers and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h53m59s)
00:53:59

[continuous variables we probably want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m04s)
00:54:04

[normalize to a zero mean one standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m05s)
00:54:05

[deviation there's a very little known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m08s)
00:54:08

[package called SK learn pandas and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m12s)
00:54:12

[actually I contributed some new stuff to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m16s)
00:54:16

[it for this course to make this even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m18s)
00:54:18

[easier to use if you use this data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m19s)
00:54:19

[mapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m22s)

[makes life very easy without it life is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m25s)
00:54:25

[very hard and because very few people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m29s)
00:54:29

[know about it about the jority of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m31s)
00:54:31

[you will find on the internet makes life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m33s)
00:54:33

[look very hard ok so use this code not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m35s)
00:54:35

[the other code actually I was talking to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m39s)
00:54:39

[some of the students the other day and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m43s)
00:54:43

[they were saying like for their project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m44s)
00:54:44

[they were like feeling lots of code from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m46s)
00:54:46

[part one of the course because I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m48s)
00:54:48

[couldn't find you know anywhere else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m50s)
00:54:50

[people writing any of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m52s)
00:54:52

[kinds of code that we've used like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m55s)
00:54:55

[know the stuff that we've learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m57s)
00:54:57

[throughout this course is in on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h54m58s)
00:54:58

[whole not not code that lives elsewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m00s)
00:55:00

[very much at all so like feel you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m04s)
00:55:04

[feel free to use a lot of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m06s)
00:55:06

[functions in your own work you know cuz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m07s)
00:55:07

[I've really tried to make them the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m11s)
00:55:11

[version of that function so one way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m13s)
00:55:13

[do the embeddings and the way that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m16s)
00:55:16

[did it in the paper is to basically say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m19s)
00:55:19

[for each categorical variable they just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m22s)
00:55:22

[manually decided what inventing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m24s)
00:55:24

[dimensionalities use they don't say in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m27s)
00:55:27

[the paper how they pick these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m29s)
00:55:29

[dimensionalities by generally speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m30s)
00:55:30

[things with a larger number of separate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m33s)
00:55:33

[levels tend to have more dimensions so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m36s)
00:55:36

[like there's I think there's like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m38s)
00:55:38

[thousand stores so that has a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m40s)
00:55:40

[embedding dimensionality where else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m43s)
00:55:43

[obviously things like promo or what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m46s)
00:55:46

[backward or they've week or whatever you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m48s)
00:55:48

[know have much smaller so this is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m51s)
00:55:51

[dictionary I created that basically goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h55m55s)

00:56:30

[make sure that there's no null so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h56m36s)

[models with empty s and then here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h56m42s)
00:56:42

[where we use the data frame member a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h56m44s)
00:56:44

[data frame mapper takes a list of tuples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h56m47s)
00:56:47

[a list of tuples with just two items in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h56m51s)
00:56:51

[the first item is the name of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h56m54s)
00:56:54

[variable for this case I'm looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h56m56s)
00:56:56

[through each categorical variable name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h56m58s)
00:56:58

[the second thing is a tuple is a class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h56m59s)
00:56:59

[or actually an instance of a class which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m03s)
00:57:03

[is going to do your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m07s)
00:57:07

[processing and there's really just two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m08s)
00:57:08

[that you're going to use almost all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m11s)
00:57:11

00:57:13

[comes with something called label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m16s)
00:57:16

[encoder it it's really badly documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[and certainly misleading you documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m22s)
00:57:22

[but this is just most this is exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m23s)
00:57:23

[what you want it's something that takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m27s)
00:57:27

[a column figures out what are other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m28s)
00:57:28

[unique values that appear in that column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m31s)
00:57:31

[and replaces them with a set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m33s)
00:57:33

[contiguous integers and so if you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m35s)
00:57:35

[the days of the week Monday through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m38s)
00:57:38

[Sunday it will replace them with zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m39s)
00:57:39

[through zero through seven and then very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m42s)
00:57:42

[importantly this is critically important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m45s)
00:57:45

[you need to make sure that the training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m49s)
00:57:49

[set and the test set have the same codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m50s)
00:57:50

[there is no point having Sunday be zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[in a training set and one in the test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m55s)
00:57:55

[set so it can't square actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h57m57s)
00:57:57

[instantiating this this class here this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m00s)
00:58:00

[object is going to actually keep track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m03s)
00:58:03

[of which codes it's using and then ditto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m05s)
00:58:05

[for the continuous we want to normalize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m09s)
00:58:09

[them to 0 1 variables but again we need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m11s)
00:58:11

[to remember what was the mean that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m15s)
00:58:15

[subtracted what was the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m17s)
00:58:17

[deviation we divided by so that we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m18s)
00:58:18

[do exactly the same thing to the test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m21s)
00:58:21

[set otherwise again our models will need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m22s)
00:58:22

[nearly totally useless so the way the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m24s)
00:58:24

[data frame mapper works is that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m27s)
00:58:27

[using this instantiated object it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m28s)
00:58:28

[going to keep track with its information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m30s)
00:58:30

[so this is basically code you can copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m32s)
00:58:32

[and paste in every one of your models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m34s)
00:58:34

[right once we cut those mappings you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m36s)
00:58:36

[just pass those to a data frame mapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m40s)
00:58:40

[and then you call dot fetch passing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m43s)
00:58:43

[your data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m47s)
00:58:47

[and so this thing now is a special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[object which has a dot features property](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m51s)
00:58:51

[that's going to contain all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m56s)
00:58:56

[pictures all of the pre-processed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h58m59s)
00:58:59

[features that you want so categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m01s)
00:59:01

[columns contains a result of doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[mapping basically doing this label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m07s)
00:59:07

[encoding so yeah so it you know in some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[ways the details of how this work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m14s)
00:59:14

[doesn't matter too much because you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m15s)
00:59:15

[just use exactly this code and every one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m17s)
00:59:17

[of your models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m19s)
00:59:19

[continuous is exactly the same code but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m21s)
00:59:21

[of course continuous it's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m24s)
00:59:24

[using standard Tacoma which is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m26s)
00:59:26

[scikit-learn thing that turns it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[zero mean one standard deviation and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m31s)
00:59:31

[variable so we've know about continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m34s)
00:59:34

[columns have all been standardized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m36s)
00:59:36

[here's an example of the first five rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m39s)
00:59:39

[from the zero column for a categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m46s)
00:59:46

[and then ditto for a continuous okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m50s)
00:59:50

[you can see these have been turned into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m53s)
00:59:53

[integers and these have been turned into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m56s)
00:59:56

[numbers which averaged to zero and have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=00h59m59s)
00:59:59

[a standard deviation of one one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m01s)
01:00:01

[nice things about this data frame mapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[is that you can now take that object and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m08s)
01:00:08

[actually store it nicoleff and so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m11s)
01:00:11

[you can use those categorical and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m14s)
01:00:14

[codings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m18s)

[and scaling parameters elsewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m18s)
01:00:18

[unpicking it you've immediately got the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m23s)
01:00:23

[same same parameters and for my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m25s)
01:00:25

[categorical variables you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m30s)
01:00:30

[the number of unique classes and every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m34s)
01:00:34

[one okay so here's my thousand one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m37s)
01:00:37

[hundred doors and thirty one day to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m39s)
01:00:39

[months and seven days of the week and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m42s)
01:00:42

[forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m45s)
01:00:45

[alright so that's the kind of key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m47s)
01:00:47

[pre-processing that has to be done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m51s)
01:00:51

[so here is their big mistake and I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m55s)
01:00:55

[if they didn't do this big mistake they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h00m59s)
01:00:59

[probably would have won their big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h01m00s)
01:01:00

[mistake is that they went join join but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h01m02s)
01:01:02

[sales not equal to zero so they've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h01m07s)
01:01:07

[removed all of the rows with no sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h01m10s)
01:01:10

[and over all of the roads where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h01m13s)
01:01:13

[store was closed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h01m16s)
01:01:16

[why was its big mistake because if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h01m18s)
01:01:18

[go to the rustman store sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h01m23s)

[neural net can capture although it might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m08s)
01:03:08

[have been better to be explicit some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m11s)
01:03:11

[stores open on Sundays not most students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m14s)
01:03:14

[but some did and for those stores that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m19s)
01:03:19

[opened on Sundays their sales on Sundays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m22s)
01:03:22

[for far higher than on any other day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m26s)
01:03:26

[right I guess that's because in Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m28s)
01:03:28

[I guess not many shops open on Sundays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m30s)
01:03:30

[so something else that they didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m32s)
01:03:32

[explicitly do was create a like in store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m35s)
01:03:35

[open on Sunday field having said that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m38s)
01:03:38

[stick the neural net may have been able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m42s)
01:03:42

[to put that in the embedding so like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m44s)
01:03:44

[you're interested during the week you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[could try and in this field and see if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m48s)
01:03:48

[it actually improves it or not certainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m50s)
01:03:50

[be interested to hear if your try adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[this field like do you find that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m53s)
01:03:53

[actually would win the competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m56s)
01:03:56

[because this this Sunday thing this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h03m59s)
01:03:59

[these are all from the same Cargill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m03s)
01:04:03

[kernel here's the day of week and here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m04s)
01:04:04

[the sales of the box plot and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m07s)
01:04:07

[see you know normally on a Sunday it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m10s)
01:04:10

[not that the sales in my China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m13s)
01:04:13

[so it's really explicitly just for these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m16s)
01:04:16

[particular stores ok so that's the kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m18s)
01:04:18

[of visualization stuff which is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m23s)
01:04:23

[helpful to do as you work through these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m27s)
01:04:27

[kinds of problems is July now I'll just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[throw lots of pictures and those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m33s)
01:04:33

[pictures were drawn in are and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m35s)
01:04:35

[are is actually pretty good for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m37s)
01:04:37

[kind of structured data so we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m38s)
01:04:38

[question so for categorical fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m41s)
01:04:41

[they're converted by the numbers not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m44s)
01:04:44

[lose me in zero right they were kept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m47s)
01:04:47

[your kids you know Monday zero Tuesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m50s)
01:04:50

[one whatever easy will send to neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m53s)
01:04:53

[network just like we're going to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m57s)
01:04:57

[there oh yeah yep we're going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h04m59s)
01:04:59

[embeddings just like we get with word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m01s)
01:05:01

[embeddings remember we turn every word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m05s)
01:05:05

[into a into a word index you know so our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m08s)
01:05:08

[sentences rather than being like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m11s)
01:05:11

[you know the dog ate the beans it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m14s)
01:05:14

[be you know three six twelve two we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m18s)
01:05:18

[going to do the same basic thing we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m21s)
01:05:21

[done the same basically okay so now that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m23s)
01:05:23

[we've done our terrible mistake we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m26s)
01:05:26

[now put still got eight hundred twenty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m30s)
01:05:30

[four thousand rows left as per usual I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m31s)
01:05:31

[made it really easy for me to create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m35s)
01:05:35

[random example and did most of my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m38s)
01:05:38

[analysis with a random sample but can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m40s)
01:05:40

[just as easily not do the random sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m42s)
01:05:42

[so now I put a separate sample version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m45s)
01:05:45

[of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m48s)
01:05:48

[okay split it into training and test now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m50s)
01:05:50

[notice here the way I spit it into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m54s)
01:05:54

[training and test is not randomly and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h05m57s)
01:05:57

[the reason it's not randomly is because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m01s)
01:06:01

[in the cattle competition they set it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m02s)
01:06:02

[the smart way the smart way to set up a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m04s)
01:06:04

[test set in a time series is to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m08s)
01:06:08

[your test sets the most recent period of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m11s)
01:06:11

[time but if you choose random points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m13s)
01:06:13

[you've got two problems the first is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m17s)
01:06:17

[you're predicting tomorrow's sales where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m19s)
01:06:19

[you always have the previous day's sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m22s)
01:06:22

[which you know is very rarely the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m24s)
01:06:24

[things really work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m27s)
01:06:27

[and then secondly you're ignoring the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m28s)
01:06:28

[fact that in the real world you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m32s)
01:06:32

[always trying to model you know a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[days or a few weeks or a few months in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[the future that hasn't happened yet so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m39s)
01:06:39

[the way you want to set up if you were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m41s)
01:06:41

[building if you were setting up the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m43s)
01:06:43

[for such a model yourself you would need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[to be deciding okay how often am I going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m48s)
01:06:48

[to be running this model how long is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m51s)
01:06:51

[going to take for those model results to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m53s)
01:06:53

[get into the field they used and however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m55s)
01:06:55

[they're being used in this case I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h06m57s)
01:06:57

[I can't really look like a month or two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m00s)
01:07:00

[alright so in that case I should make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m03s)
01:07:03

[sure there's a month or two gap between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m06s)
01:07:06

[you know or a month or two test set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[which is the last bit right so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m12s)
01:07:12

[see here I've taken the last ten percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m14s)
01:07:14

[of my validation set and it's literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m17s)
01:07:17

[just is the first bit and here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m20s)
01:07:20

[last bit and since it was already sorted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m23s)
01:07:23

[by date this ensures that I have it done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m27s)
01:07:27

[the way I want I just wanted to point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m30s)
01:07:30

[out that it's tend to lead since your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m33s)
01:07:33

[public take a break then we sure will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m35s)
01:07:35

[okay so this is how you take that data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[frame metal object we created earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m50s)
01:07:50

[and we caught fit in order to like learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m52s)
01:07:52

[you know the transformation parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m55s)
01:07:55

[see you then call transform to actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h07m58s)
01:07:58

[do it right so take my training set and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m02s)
01:08:02

[transform it to grab the categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m07s)
01:08:07

[variables and then the continuous creep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m09s)
01:08:09

[processing needs the same things my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m12s)
01:08:12

[continuous map so pre-process my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m13s)
01:08:13

[training set and grab my continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m16s)
01:08:16

[variables okay so that's nearly done the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m18s)
01:08:18

[only final piece is in their solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[they modified their their target so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m31s)
01:08:31

[there's their sales value and the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m36s)
01:08:36

[they modified it was that they found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m38s)
01:08:38

[what is the highest amount of sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m40s)
01:08:40

[right and they took along with that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m43s)
01:08:43

[then they modified all of their y-values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m47s)
01:08:47

[to take the log of sales divided by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m50s)
01:08:50

[maximum work or sales so what this means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m53s)
01:08:53

[is that if the Y values are going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m56s)
01:08:56

[vary they're going to be no higher than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h08m59s)
01:08:59

[one and furthermore remember how they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m02s)
01:09:02

[had a long tail the average was five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m05s)
01:09:05

[thousand but the maximum was like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m06s)
01:09:06

[40-something thousand this is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m08s)
01:09:08

[common right like most financial data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m11s)
01:09:11

[sales data so forth generally has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m13s)
01:09:13

[nicer shape when it's logged that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m16s)
01:09:16

[does not so taking the log is a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[good idea the reason that that as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m21s)
01:09:21

[as taking the log they also did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m24s)
01:09:24

[division and as it means that what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m25s)
01:09:25

[can now do is we can use an activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m28s)
01:09:28

[function in our neural net of a sigmoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m30s)
01:09:30

[right which goes between Norton one and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m32s)
01:09:32

[then just multiply by the maximum log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m35s)
01:09:35

[and so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m38s)
01:09:38

[actually go to ensure that the data is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m39s)
01:09:39

[in the right scaling area I actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m41s)
01:09:41

[tried taking this out and it actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m44s)
01:09:44

[this technique doesn't really seem to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m46s)
01:09:46

[help and it actually reminds me of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[style transfer paper where they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m52s)
01:09:52

[mentioned they originally had like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m56s)
01:09:56

[hyperbolic tanh layer at the end so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h09m58s)
01:09:58

[exactly the same reason to make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m00s)
01:10:00

[everything was black between Norton to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m02s)
01:10:02

[55 and actually turns out if you just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m03s)
01:10:03

[use linear activation it worked just as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m05s)
01:10:05

[well so interestingly this idea of using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m07s)
01:10:07

[sigmoids at the end in order to get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[right range doesn't seem to be that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m14s)
01:10:14

[helpful my guess is the reason why is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m16s)
01:10:16

[because for a sigmoid it's like really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m19s)
01:10:19

[difficult to get the maximum and I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[actually what they should have done is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m25s)
01:10:25

[they probably should have like instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m26s)
01:10:26

[of using maximum they should have used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m28s)
01:10:28

[like maximum x 1.25 you know so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m30s)
01:10:30

[they never have to predict one you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m34s)
01:10:34

[but it's impossible to predict one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m36s)
01:10:36

[because it's a sigmoid someone asked is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m38s)
01:10:38

[there any issue in fitting the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m43s)
01:10:43

[pre-processors on the full training and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m44s)
01:10:44

[validation data shouldn't they be fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m46s)
01:10:46

[only to the training set no it's fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m48s)
01:10:48

[in fact to the categorical variables you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m53s)
01:10:53

[know if you don't insert the test set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h10m59s)
01:10:59

[then you're going to have some codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m01s)
01:11:01

[that aren't there at all or else its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m02s)
01:11:02

[weight is going to be random which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m05s)
01:11:05

[better than failing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m07s)

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m08s)
01:11:08

[yeah as for deciding you know what to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m10s)
01:11:10

[divide and subtract in order to get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m13s)

[zero one random variable it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m14s)

[really matter it's not it's there's no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m16s)
01:11:16

[leakage involved that's what you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[worried about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m20s)
01:11:20

[okay root mean squared percent error is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m23s)
01:11:23

[what the cattle competition use as the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m28s)
01:11:28

[official loss function so this is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m30s)
01:11:30

[calculating it so before we take a break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m32s)
01:11:32

[we'll just finally take a look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m35s)
01:11:35

[definition of the model I'll kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m38s)
01:11:38

[work backwards this okay here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[basic model right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m47s)
01:11:47

[get our embeddings combine the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m51s)
01:11:51

[embeddings for the continuous variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m53s)

[ten players more drop out and then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h11m58s)
01:11:58

[final sigmoid activation function you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m01s)
01:12:01

[see that I've got like comments as out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[stuff all over the place and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m07s)
01:12:07

[because like I had a lot of questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m09s)
01:12:09

[we're going to cover this after the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m11s)
01:12:11

[break a lot of questions about some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m12s)
01:12:12

[the details like why did they do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m13s)
01:12:13

[think certain ways you know some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m17s)
01:12:17

[things they did were like so weird I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m19s)
01:12:19

[just thought they couldn't possibly be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m20s)
01:12:20

[right I did some experimenting we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m22s)
01:12:22

[know more about that in a moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m24s)
01:12:24

[so the embeddings as per usual I create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m26s)
01:12:26

[a little function to create an embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m30s)
01:12:30

[which first of all creates my regular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m34s)
01:12:34

[chaos input layer and then it creates my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m37s)
01:12:37

[embedding layer and then how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m41s)
01:12:41

[embedding dimensions are going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m44s)
01:12:44

[sometimes I look them up in their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m46s)
01:12:46

[dictionary I had earlier and sometimes I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m48s)
01:12:48

[calculated them using this simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m52s)
01:12:52

[approach of saying I will use however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m54s)
01:12:54

[many levels there are in the categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m56s)
01:12:56

[variable divided by two with a maximum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h12m58s)
01:12:58

[of 50 so it's like these for two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m02s)
01:13:02

[different techniques other planners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m04s)
01:13:04

[normally with like word embeddings you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[have a whole sentence right and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m10s)
01:13:10

[end up you've got to feed it to an hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m12s)
01:13:12

[and n and so you have time steps but so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m14s)
01:13:14

[normally you have an input length equal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m16s)
01:13:16

[to the length of your sentence now this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m18s)
01:13:18

[is the time sketch when ironing we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m21s)
01:13:21

[have an R we don't have any time steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m23s)
01:13:23

[we just have one element in one column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m26s)
01:13:26

[so therefore I have to pass flattened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m30s)
01:13:30

[after this because it's going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m33s)
01:13:33

[this redundant unit one prime axis that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m36s)
01:13:36

[I don't want right so this is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m40s)
01:13:40

[because you know people don't normally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m42s)
01:13:42

[do this kind of stuff with embedding so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m44s)
01:13:44

[they're assuming that you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m46s)
01:13:46

[kind of want it in a format ready to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m48s)
01:13:48

[to an R and n so this is just turning it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m49s)
01:13:49

[back into a normal format so we grabbed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m51s)
01:13:51

[each embedding we end up with a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m55s)
01:13:55

[list of those we then combine all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h13m57s)
01:13:57

[those embeddings with all of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m01s)
01:14:01

[continuous variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[into a single list of variables and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m03s)
01:14:03

[then our model is going to have all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m06s)
01:14:06

[those embedding inputs and all about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m10s)
01:14:10

[continuous inputs and then we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m12s)
01:14:12

[compile it and train it alright so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m15s)
01:14:15

[take a break and see you back here at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m20s)
01:14:20

[five past 8:00 okay so so we've got our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m23s)
01:14:23

[neural net set up we trained it in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m48s)
01:14:48

[usual way go see it and yeah where we go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h14m53s)
01:14:53

[so that's basically that and it's um the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m04s)
01:15:04

[Train reasonably quickly six minutes in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m10s)
01:15:10

[this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m18s)
01:15:18

[sorry to show you and so you got two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m20s)
01:15:20

[questions that came in and right when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m23s)
01:15:23

[bring you over one of them is for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m25s)
01:15:25

[normalization is it possible to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m28s)
01:15:28

[another function other than log such as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m30s)
01:15:30

[sigmoid I don't think you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m32s)
01:15:32

[use stick noise like a kind of financial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m40s)
01:15:40

[data and sales data and stuff tends to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m43s)
01:15:43

[be of a shake we're low chroma cat more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m45s)
01:15:45

[linear which is generally what you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m49s)
01:15:49

[and then when we lock lock transform our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m51s)
01:15:51

[target variable we're also transforming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[the squared error is this a problem or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m56s)
01:15:56

[is it helping the model to find a better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h15m59s)
01:15:59

[minimum air in the I'm transforming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m01s)
01:16:01

[space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m03s)
01:16:03

[yeah so you're going to be careful about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m03s)
01:16:03

[what loss function you want in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m05s)
01:16:05

[the caracal competition is trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m06s)
01:16:06

[minimize root mean square error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[so I actually then said okay I want you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m10s)
01:16:10

[to do mean absolute error because that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m13s)
01:16:13

[you know what in in log space that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m18s)
01:16:18

[kind of basically doing the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m20s)
01:16:20

[right the percent is a ratio so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m22s)
01:16:22

[the absolute error between two logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m26s)
01:16:26

[which is basically the same as a ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[so yeah you need to make sure your loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m29s)
01:16:29

[function is appropriate in that space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m32s)
01:16:32

[and I think this is one of the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m37s)
01:16:37

[that they didn't do in the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m39s)
01:16:39

[competition with node tribe as you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m40s)
01:16:40

[see I tried changing it I think it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m42s)
01:16:42

[helped okay by the way extra boost is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m44s)
01:16:44

[fantastic here is the same series of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m54s)
01:16:54

[steps to run this model with extra boost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h16m59s)
01:16:59

[as you can see I just concatenate my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m02s)
01:17:02

[categorical and continuous for training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m05s)
01:17:05

[and for my validation set here is a set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m07s)
01:17:07

[of parameters which tends to work pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m11s)
01:17:11

[well now XG boost has a data type called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m14s)
01:17:14

[D matrix of data metrics which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m20s)
01:17:20

[basically a normal matrix but it keeps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m22s)
01:17:22

[track of the names of the features so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m25s)
01:17:25

[like print out or you know better better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m28s)
01:17:28

[information and then you go to on train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m31s)
01:17:31

[and this takes like less than a second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m33s)
01:17:33

[to run and it's not massively worse than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m36s)
01:17:36

[our previous result and so it's like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m39s)
01:17:39

[good way to kind of get started the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m45s)
01:17:45

[reason that next G boost and random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m47s)
01:17:47

[forests is particularly helpful it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m49s)
01:17:49

[because it does something called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m52s)
01:17:52

[variable importance right so this is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m53s)
01:17:53

[you get the variable importance for an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[excuse model so it takes a second and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h17m58s)
01:17:58

[suddenly here is the information you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m01s)
01:18:01

[need so when I was having trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m04s)
01:18:04

[replicating the original results from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m08s)

[the first place Twitter's one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m12s)
01:18:12

[things that helped me a lot was to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m14s)
01:18:14

[at this feature importance plot and say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m16s)
01:18:16

[okay competition distance holy cow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m18s)
01:18:18

[that's really really important let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m21s)
01:18:21

[make sure that my competition distance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m24s)
01:18:24

[results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m26s)
01:18:26

[you know pre-processing really is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m27s)
01:18:27

[exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m28s)
01:18:28

[on the other hand event doesn't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m31s)
01:18:31

[matter at all so I'm not going to worry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m36s)
01:18:36

[really at all about checking my events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m38s)
01:18:38

[this feature importance or variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m41s)
01:18:41

[importance plot also it's known you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m45s)
01:18:45

[also create with a random forest these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m47s)
01:18:47

[things are amazing right because you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m50s)
01:18:50

[using a tree ensemble it doesn't like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m52s)
01:18:52

[doesn't matter the shape of anything it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m56s)
01:18:56

[doesn't matter if you have or don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h18m59s)
01:18:59

[interactions you know this is all like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m01s)
01:19:01

[totally kind of assumption free so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m03s)
01:19:03

[this is in real life this is the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m08s)
01:19:08

[thing I do like the first thing I do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m10s)
01:19:10

[try to get a feature important spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m12s)
01:19:12

[printer because that tells me it often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m14s)
01:19:14

[it turns out there's only three or four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m18s)
01:19:18

[variables in there but like if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m19s)
01:19:19

[got 10,000 variables so I worked on a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m22s)
01:19:22

[big credit scoring problem a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m24s)
01:19:24

[years ago I have nine and a half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m26s)
01:19:26

[thousand variables it turned out that 99](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m28s)
01:19:28

[is the matter great and so the company I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m30s)
01:19:30

[was working for like literally it spent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m32s)
01:19:32

[something like five million dollars on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m35s)
01:19:35

[this big management consulting project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m37s)
01:19:37

[and this big management consulting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m38s)
01:19:38

[projects have told them all these ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m40s)
01:19:40

[in which they can like capture all this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m42s)
01:19:42

[information is really clean way to their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m43s)
01:19:43

[credit scoring models and of course none](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m46s)
01:19:46

[of those things are in these nine and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m49s)
01:19:49

[that you know so they could have saved a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m51s)
01:19:51

[billion dollars down it goes it's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m53s)
01:19:53

[shrinking so many companies don't these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m57s)
01:19:57

[random firsts so you know I can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h19m59s)
01:19:59

[overestimate you know uh overstate the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m02s)
01:20:02

[importance of this plot but you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m04s)
01:20:04

[it's this is a deep learning course so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m07s)
01:20:07

[we're not really going to spend time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m09s)
01:20:09

[talks about it now I mentioned that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m10s)
01:20:10

[had a whole bunch of like there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[whole bunch of like really really really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m19s)
01:20:19

[weird things in the way that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m21s)
01:20:21

[competitions that place getters did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m24s)
01:20:24

[things for one Thank You does normalized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m26s)
01:20:26

[a continuous variance who does that but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m32s)
01:20:32

[then when people do well no competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m36s)
01:20:36

[something's working you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m39s)
01:20:39

[[Music]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m42s)
01:20:42

[the ways in which they initialize their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m44s)
01:20:44

[embedding were really really weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m49s)
01:20:49

[there's all these things that really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m52s)
01:20:52

[really weird so what I did was I wrote a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m53s)
01:20:53

[little script](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h20m59s)
01:20:59

[rosemon experiments and what I did was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m07s)
01:21:07

[basically I copied and pasted all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m11s)
01:21:11

[important code out of my logbook and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m13s)
01:21:13

[remember I've already pickled the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m16s)
01:21:16

[parameters for the you know label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m19s)
01:21:19

[encoder and the gala so I don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m22s)
01:21:22

[worry about doing those again and once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m24s)
01:21:24

[they copied and pasted all that code in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m28s)
01:21:28

[so this is exactly all the code you just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m29s)
01:21:29

[saw I then had this you know bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m31s)
01:21:31

[for loops right pretty inelegant but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m42s)
01:21:42

[these are all of the things that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m45s)
01:21:45

[wanted to basically find out like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m46s)
01:21:46

[doesn't matter whether or not you use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m48s)
01:21:48

[you know one zero scanning it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m52s)
01:21:52

[matter whether you use that we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m56s)
01:21:56

[approach to initializing embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m57s)
01:21:57

[doesn't matter whether you use their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h21m58s)
01:21:58

[particular dictionary of embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m00s)
01:22:00

[dimensions or use my simple little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m04s)
01:22:04

[formula something else I tried it you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m05s)
01:22:05

[know they basically took all their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m09s)
01:22:09

[continuous variables and put them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m11s)
01:22:11

[through like a separate little dense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[layer each so I was like why don't we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m14s)
01:22:14

[put them all together now so try some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m16s)
01:22:16

[other things like using batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m18s)
01:22:18

[normalization so I ran this and got back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m19s)
01:22:19

[every possible combination of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m23s)
01:22:23

[right so this is like this is where you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m26s)
01:22:26

[want to be using the script you know and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m28s)
01:22:28

[like I'm not going to tell you that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m30s)
01:22:30

[jump straight to this first of all I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m32s)
01:22:32

[spent days screwing around experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m35s)
01:22:35

[in a notebook by hand continually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m38s)
01:22:38

[forgetting what I had just done until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m40s)
01:22:40

[eventually I just you know it took me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m44s)
01:22:44

[like an hour to write this and then of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m45s)
01:22:45

[course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m50s)
01:22:50

[i pasted it into Excel and here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m51s)
01:22:51

[right chuck it into a pivot table use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h22m56s)
01:22:56

[conditional formatting and here's my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m00s)
01:23:00

[results right so you can see all my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m02s)
01:23:02

[different combinations with and without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m03s)
01:23:03

[normalization with my special function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m05s)
01:23:05

[versus their dictionary using a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[dense matrix S is putting everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m12s)
01:23:12

[together using their weird in FS not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m14s)
01:23:14

[using a weird inner so my n FS is there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m16s)
01:23:16

[live in it and here is this stark blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m19s)
01:23:19

[here is their what they do right I'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m24s)
01:23:24

[like to it's full of weird to me right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m29s)
01:23:29

[then as you can see it's actually the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m33s)
01:23:33

[darkest blue it's actually it actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m36s)
01:23:36

[is the band but then when you kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m37s)
01:23:37

[zoom out you realize there's a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m40s)
01:23:40

[corner over here that's like got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m42s)
01:23:42

[couple of eight-six's nearly as good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m45s)
01:23:45

[right but seems much more consistent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m48s)
01:23:48

[which is and also more consistent with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m51s)
01:23:51

[sanity like yet do normalize your data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m54s)
01:23:54

[and yes do use an appropriate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h23m57s)
01:23:57

[initialization function and if you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m00s)
01:24:00

[those two things and it doesn't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m02s)
01:24:02

[matter what else you do and so on and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m03s)
01:24:03

[work fine so when I then did was I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m04s)
01:24:04

[created a little spark line in Excel for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m07s)
01:24:07

[the actual training graphs right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m11s)
01:24:11

[here's their here's their winning one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m14s)
01:24:14

[chomp again went over 85 that here's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m17s)
01:24:17

[variance of like getting there and as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[you can see their approach was kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m25s)
01:24:25

[pretty bumpy up and down up and down up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m26s)
01:24:26

[and down the second-best on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m27s)
01:24:27

[hand okay point hello a six thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m30s)
01:24:30

[over five is going down very smoothly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m34s)
01:24:34

[okay and so that makes me think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m36s)
01:24:36

[different that it's in like this very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m39s)
01:24:39

[stable part of the world and given us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m41s)
01:24:41

[training much better I actually think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m43s)
01:24:43

[this is just random chance you know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m45s)
01:24:45

[just happened to be low at this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m47s)
01:24:47

[I actually thought this is a better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m49s)
01:24:49

[approach you know it's more it's more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m51s)
01:24:51

[sensible and it's more consistent it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m54s)
01:24:54

[quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m57s)
01:24:57

[so this kind of approach to running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h24m58s)
01:24:58

[experiments place I thought I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[show you you know to say like when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m03s)
01:25:03

[run experiment try and do it in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m06s)
01:25:06

[rigorous way and track both the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m09s)
01:25:09

[stability of the approach as well as the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m11s)
01:25:11

[actual result of the approach so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m15s)
01:25:15

[know this one here makes so much sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m17s)
01:25:17

[it's like use my simple function rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m19s)
01:25:19

[than there we're dictionary use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m21s)
01:25:21

[normalization use the single dense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m23s)
01:25:23

[matrix and use a thoughtful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m26s)
01:25:26

[initialization and you do all those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m27s)
01:25:27

[things you end up with something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m29s)
01:25:29

[basically it's good and much more stable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m30s)
01:25:30

[okay that's all I wanted to tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m35s)
01:25:35

[about rustman I'm going to very briefly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m42s)
01:25:42

[mention another competition which is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m43s)
01:25:43

[cattle taxi destination competition the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m48s)
01:25:48

[cattle destination yeah nice to never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m53s)
01:25:53

[hear through um you you were saying that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h25m56s)
01:25:56

[you did a couple of experiments one you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m01s)
01:26:01

[feel them bearing from them to them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m05s)
01:26:05

[balancing to running forests and then to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m07s)
01:26:07

[invariance again into you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m10s)
01:26:10

[needlework oh I didn't do that the that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m12s)
01:26:12

[was from the paper yeah I don't know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m15s)
01:26:15

[ten because you just use one your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m17s)
01:26:17

[network to where we think together or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m19s)
01:26:19

[not yeah so what they did was for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m21s)
01:26:21

[one here this one one five they they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m24s)
01:26:24

[trained the neural network I just showed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m26s)
01:26:26

[you they didn't throw away the neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m27s)
01:26:27

[network and trained a GBM model but for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m31s)
01:26:31

[the categorical variables rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m36s)
01:26:36

[using one hunting coatings they use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m37s)
01:26:37

[events that's all okay so the taxi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[competition was won by the team with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m46s)
01:26:46

[this unicode game which is pretty cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m51s)
01:26:51

[and it's actually turned out for your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m53s)
01:26:53

[team run by Joshua NGO who some you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m55s)
01:26:55

[one of the people that stuck it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h26m59s)
01:26:59

[through the AI winter and is now kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m01s)
01:27:01

[one of the leading lights in deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m03s)
01:27:03

[learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m06s)
01:27:06

[and interestingly the thing I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m07s)
01:27:07

[showed you the rustling competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m10s)
01:27:10

[today actually this paper they wrote in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m12s)
01:27:12

[the rustling competition they claimed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m14s)
01:27:14

[have invented this idea of categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m16s)
01:27:16

[inventing but actually the entre of NGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m18s)
01:27:18

[team won this competition a year earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m22s)
01:27:22

[with the same technique but you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m24s)
01:27:24

[again it's someone cool nobody noticed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m27s)
01:27:27

[even though it josh of NGO so I want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m30s)
01:27:30

[quickly show you what they did this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m33s)
01:27:33

[the paper they wrote ok and their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m37s)
01:27:37

[approach to picking an embedding size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m41s)
01:27:41

[was very simple use 10 okay so the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m43s)
01:27:43

[was which customer is taking this taxi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m49s)
01:27:49

[which taxi are they in which taxis pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m53s)
01:27:53

[did they get the taxi from and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h27m58s)
01:27:58

[quarter hour of the day day of the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m00s)
01:28:00

[week of the year and they didn't add all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m03s)
01:28:03

[kinds of other stuff this is basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m07s)
01:28:07

[it right and so then they said ok we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m08s)
01:28:08

[going to learn embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m13s)
01:28:13

[inspired by NLP but and so actually to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m15s)
01:28:15

[my knowledge this is the first time this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m19s)
01:28:19

[appeared in the literature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m21s)
01:28:21

[having said that I'm sure I'm a thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m22s)
01:28:22

[people the course is not obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m25s)
01:28:25

[machination four came up as a quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m27s)
01:28:27

[sanity check if you have days a week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m33s)
01:28:33

[like the southern even one seven one hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m36s)
01:28:36

[variable potentials and inventing sizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m39s)
01:28:39

[10 yeah that doesn't make any sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m43s)
01:28:43

[right yeah so I used to think that but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m45s)
01:28:45

[actually it does like such an absence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m50s)
01:28:50

[having the last few months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m53s)
01:28:53

[quite often ended up with bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m54s)
01:28:54

[embeddings in my original fab analogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m56s)
01:28:56

[and often it does give better results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h28m58s)
01:28:58

[and I think it's just like when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m02s)
01:29:02

[realize it's just a dense layer on top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m05s)
01:29:05

[of a 100 coding it's like okay why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m08s)
01:29:08

[shouldn't a dense layer have more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m10s)
01:29:10

[information you know yeah I found it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m11s)
01:29:11

[weird too I still find a little weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m14s)
01:29:14

[but it definitely seems to be something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m16s)
01:29:16

[that's quite useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m18s)
01:29:18

[they're kids doesn't help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m20s)
01:29:20

[cuz that's tough huh yeah yeah I have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m27s)
01:29:27

[absolutely found pretty good times down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m31s)
01:29:31

[where I need be here of any metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m35s)
01:29:35

[dimensionalities in my than my cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m39s)
01:29:39

[analogy of my categorical variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m41s)
01:29:41

[okay now in this competition again at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m44s)
01:29:44

[the time Terry's competition really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m48s)
01:29:48

[because the main thing you've given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m50s)
01:29:50

[other than all this metadata is series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m53s)
01:29:53

[of GPS points which is every GPS point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m56s)
01:29:56

[along the route and at some point for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h29m59s)
01:29:59

[the test set the route is cut off and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m02s)
01:30:02

[you have to figure out what the final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m04s)
01:30:04

[GPS point would have been where are they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m07s)
01:30:07

[going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m09s)
01:30:09

[I'm here's the model that they won with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m12s)
01:30:12

[turned up again to be very simple you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m17s)
01:30:17

[take all the metadata with the store and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m21s)
01:30:21

[Chuck it through the embeddings you then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m23s)
01:30:23

[take the first five GPS points and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m27s)
01:30:27

[last five GPS points and concatenate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m30s)
01:30:30

[them together with the embeddings chuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m33s)
01:30:33

[them through the hidden layer enter a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m35s)
01:30:35

[soft Max and now this is quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[interesting what they didn't do is they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m41s)
01:30:41

[check the result of this soft max right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m44s)
01:30:44

[and they combine it with clusters now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m47s)
01:30:47

[what are these classes they used mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m50s)
01:30:50

[clustering to figure out where are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m56s)
01:30:56

[places people can to go but to attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h30m59s)
01:30:59

[these people tend to go to the airport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m01s)
01:31:01

[or they'd enter go to the hospital or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m03s)
01:31:03

[they tend to go to the shopping strip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m05s)
01:31:05

[right so using mainship clustering they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m07s)
01:31:07

[came up with I think was about three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m11s)
01:31:11

[thousand factors you know XY coordinates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m12s)
01:31:12

[or places that people tend to go however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m17s)
01:31:17

[people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m21s)
01:31:21

[I always go to those 3,000 places so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m23s)
01:31:23

[this is the really cool thing by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m26s)
01:31:26

[producing a soft mat and then they took](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m27s)
01:31:27

[the softmax and they multiplied it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m30s)
01:31:30

[here multiplied it and took a weighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m33s)
01:31:33

[average using the softmax as the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m34s)
01:31:34

[and the cluster centers as the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m37s)
01:31:37

[that you're texting the weighted average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m40s)
01:31:40

[up so in other words if they're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m41s)
01:31:41

[the airport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m43s)
01:31:43

[Koosh or the softmax will end up getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m44s)
01:31:44

[a PR very close to 1 to the airport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m47s)
01:31:47

[cutter on the other hand if it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m50s)
01:31:50

[really that clear whether they're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m53s)
01:31:53

[to this shopping trip or this movie then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m55s)
01:31:55

[those two trans defenses could both have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h31m59s)
01:31:59

[a soft mess about point 5 and so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m02s)
01:32:02

[going to add end up getting somewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m04s)
01:32:04

[halfway between the two so like this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m06s)
01:32:06

[really interesting like they built a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m10s)
01:32:10

[different kind of architecture to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m13s)
01:32:13

[anything we've seen before where the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m16s)
01:32:16

[softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m18s)
01:32:18

[is not the last thing we do right it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m19s)
01:32:19

[being used to average about your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m21s)
01:32:21

[clusters and so this is really smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m24s)
01:32:24

[because the softmax forces it to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m27s)
01:32:27

[easier for it to pick a specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m31s)
01:32:31

[destination that's very common but also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m34s)
01:32:34

[makes it possible for it to predict any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m36s)
01:32:36

[destination anywhere by combining you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m39s)
01:32:39

[know the average of a number of classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m42s)
01:32:42

[together but I think this is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m44s)
01:32:44

[elegant architecture engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m46s)
01:32:46

[um so projectory prefix so last four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m49s)
01:32:49

[dots it's like 5 5 kgs point but just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m54s)
01:32:54

[isn't central to return continue last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h32m57s)
01:32:57

[five GPS points that we're given right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m00s)
01:33:00

[and so to create the training set what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m03s)
01:33:03

[they did was they took all of the routes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m06s)
01:33:06

[and they truncated them randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m08s)
01:33:08

[basically so every time they sampled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m13s)
01:33:13

[another route I think of the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m15s)
01:33:15

[generator basically the data generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m18s)
01:33:18

[would like randomly slice it off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m20s)
01:33:20

[somewhere so this was the last 5 points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m22s)
01:33:22

[which we have access to and the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m28s)
01:33:28

[five points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m30s)
01:33:30

[the reason is not all the points is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m32s)
01:33:32

[because they're using a standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m35s)
01:33:35

[multi-layer perceptron here so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m37s)
01:33:37

[you know it's a variable length you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m39s)
01:33:39

[a and also you don't want it to be too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m41s)
01:33:41

[big there's a question so the prefix is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m43s)
01:33:43

[not set into an RNN it's just fed into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m48s)
01:33:48

[dense layer correct yeah so we just get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m50s)
01:33:50

[10 points concatenated together into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m53s)
01:33:53

[dense layer so surprisingly simple how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m55s)
01:33:55

[good was it well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h33m59s)
01:33:59

[look at the results 2 1 4 2 1 4 2 1 3 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m07s)
01:34:07

[you know everybody's clustered together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m13s)
01:34:13

[one person is a bit better at 2:08 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m15s)
01:34:15

[then we're way better at sure what a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m18s)
01:34:18

[tree and then they mentioned by the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m20s)
01:34:20

[in the paper they didn't actually have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[time to finish training so when they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m23s)
01:34:23

[actually finished training it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m25s)
01:34:25

[actually one fourth at 7:00 right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[they like their one so easily as more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m30s)
01:34:30

[funny and interesting in the paper they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m33s)
01:34:33

[actually mentioned the test set was so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m35s)
01:34:35

[small that the oh they knew that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m37s)
01:34:37

[only way that could be shorter win was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m39s)
01:34:39

[to make sure they won easily now the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m41s)
01:34:41

[constitution step is so small the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m45s)
01:34:45

[leaderboard is actually not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m47s)
01:34:47

[statistically that great so they created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m49s)
01:34:49

[a custom test set and try to see if they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m51s)
01:34:51

[could find something that's even better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m54s)
01:34:54

[still on the custom test set and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m56s)
01:34:56

[turns out that actually an RNN is better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h34m58s)
01:34:58

[still it still would have won the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m01s)
01:35:01

[competition but I'm just there's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m03s)
01:35:03

[enough data in the cable test set that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m05s)
01:35:05

[this is a statistically significant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m08s)
01:35:08

[result in this case it is statistically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m10s)
01:35:10

[significant a regular RNN wasn't done up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m12s)
01:35:12

[but what they did instead was they said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m17s)
01:35:17

[let's take an hour an end where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m18s)

[passed in five points at a time in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m21s)
01:35:21

[RNN basically I think what probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m24s)
01:35:24

[would have been even better would be to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m28s)
01:35:28

[have had a convolutional layer first and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m30s)
01:35:30

[then pass that into an R and n they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h35m32s)

[build a model like this it doesn't look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m19s)
01:37:19

[that complex but there's just so many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m20s)
01:37:20

[places that you can measure little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m22s)

[not you know normal people like me make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m31s)
01:37:31

[dozens of mistakes so when you build a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m32s)
01:37:32

[model like this you need to find a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m34s)
01:37:34

[to test every single line of code any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m37s)

[line of code you don't test I guarantee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m40s)
01:37:40

[you'll end up at the bug and you won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m41s)

[know you have about and there's no way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m43s)
01:37:43

[to ever find out you have a bug so did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m45s)
01:37:45

[you have a neutral we had several](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m48s)
01:37:48

[questions one is if a note that piti is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m50s)
01:37:50

[very similar to what happens in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h37m56s)

[output embeddings are weighted by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m00s)
01:38:00

[attention probability no or you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m02s)
01:38:02

[it's a lot like a regular attentional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m04s)
01:38:04

[and language model yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m07s)
01:38:07

[can you talk more about the idea you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m10s)
01:38:10

[have about first having the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m12s)
01:38:12

[convolutional layer and passing that to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m13s)
01:38:13

[an RNN what do you mean by that so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m15s)
01:38:15

[is a fantastic paper which is uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m20s)
01:38:20

[so cut it up right let me just find this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m25s)
01:38:25

[paper oh here it is yes you know we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m30s)
01:38:30

[looked at um these are kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m39s)
01:38:39

[supporting coatings last week for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m45s)

[language models I don't know if any if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m49s)
01:38:49

[you thought about this and wondered like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m51s)
01:38:51

[or what if we just had individual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m52s)
01:38:52

[characters and there's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m55s)
01:38:55

[fascinating paper called fully character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h38m57s)
01:38:57

[level machine translation with no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m00s)
01:39:00

[explicit segmentation from the member of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m02s)
01:39:02

[last year and they actually get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m06s)
01:39:06

[fantastic results on just character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m08s)
01:39:08

[level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m11s)
01:39:11

[beating pretty much everything including](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m13s)
01:39:13

[the VP approach we saw last time I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m17s)
01:39:17

[just showing the results here yeah so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m19s)
01:39:19

[they looked at lots of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m24s)
01:39:24

[approaches and you know comparing bpe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m24s)
01:39:24

[to individual character and most of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m29s)
01:39:29

[time they got the best results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m32s)
01:39:32

[there our model looks like this right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m35s)
01:39:35

[they start out with every individual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m39s)
01:39:39

[character it goes to a character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m40s)
01:39:40

[embedding just like we've these Taktarov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m42s)
01:39:42

[any lots of times and then you take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m44s)
01:39:44

[those character embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m46s)
01:39:46

[and you pass it through a one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m47s)
01:39:47

[dimensional convolution yeah I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m50s)
01:39:50

[know if you guys remember that in part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m53s)
01:39:53

[of this course then actually had a blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m56s)
01:39:56

[post about showing how you can do like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h39m59s)
01:39:59

[multiple size convolutions and catnip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m01s)
01:40:01

[them all together so you could use that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m03s)
01:40:03

[approach or you could just pick a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m05s)
01:40:05

[size right so you end up basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m08s)
01:40:08

[scrolling your convolutional window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m11s)
01:40:11

[across your sets of characters and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m13s)
01:40:13

[you end up with the same number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m17s)
01:40:17

[convolution outputs as you started out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m19s)
01:40:19

[with letters right but they're now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m22s)
01:40:22

[representing the information in a window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m23s)
01:40:23

[around that letter right in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m27s)
01:40:27

[get max Pauling right so they basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m31s)
01:40:31

[said okay which window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m33s)
01:40:33

[assuming that you know maybe we had I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m38s)
01:40:38

[think so this is to look at different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m39s)
01:40:39

[sizes of size 4 or size 3 and of size 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m41s)
01:40:41

[which bits you know seem to be centered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m43s)
01:40:43

[got the highest activations around here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m48s)
01:40:48

[and then they took those max called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m50s)
01:40:50

[things and they put them through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m52s)
01:40:52

[second set of second embeddings they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m54s)
01:40:54

[didn't put that system called a highway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m57s)
01:40:57

[network which details that matter too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h40m58s)
01:40:58

[much it's kind of something like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m00s)
01:41:00

[identity like we learned about last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m01s)
01:41:01

[this is a slightly older approach from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m04s)
01:41:04

[the internet and then finally UPS doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m07s)
01:41:07

[all that think that to a neuron in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m09s)
01:41:09

[so the idea here in this model was they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m12s)
01:41:12

[basically you know did as much word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m15s)
01:41:15

[pre-processing as possible and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m20s)
01:41:20

[finally put that into nrm and because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m22s)
01:41:22

[we've got these Mac falling layers this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m26s)
01:41:26

[R and n ends up with a lot less time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m28s)
01:41:28

[points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m30s)
01:41:30

[is really important to minimize the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m35s)
01:41:35

[amount of processing in the air Annette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m36s)
01:41:36

[so I'm not going to go to detail on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m38s)
01:41:38

[but you know check out this paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m40s)
01:41:40

[because it's a really interesting next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m43s)
01:41:43

[question is so for the destinations we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m46s)
01:41:46

[would have more air for the peripheral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m49s)
01:41:49

[points are we taking a centroid of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m51s)
01:41:51

[clustered I don't understand that sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m53s)
01:41:53

[you understand it I mean all we're doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h41m58s)
01:41:58

[is we're taking the soft next P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m02s)
01:42:02

[multiplied by the collapse of C over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m04s)
01:42:04

[play them up I thought the first part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m06s)
01:42:06

[was asking that with destinations that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m11s)
01:42:11

[are more peripheral peripheral they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m14s)
01:42:14

[would have higher air because it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m16s)
01:42:16

[be harder to predict this way yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m17s)
01:42:17

[probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m19s)
01:42:19

[which is fine because by definition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m19s)
01:42:19

[they're not close to a cluster Center so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m21s)
01:42:21

[they're not common and then going back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m23s)
01:42:23

[there's a question on the the Rossman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m26s)
01:42:26

[example what does ma PE with neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m29s)
01:42:29

[networks mean I would have expected that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m33s)
01:42:33

[result to be the same why is it lower so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m35s)
01:42:35

[this is just using a one-pot encoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m37s)
01:42:37

[without an without an embedding layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m39s)
01:42:39

[okay all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m42s)
01:42:42

[gosh we could have run out of time a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m48s)
01:42:48

[quickly but I really want to show you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m50s)
01:42:50

[this so quite a few of the students and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m52s)
01:42:52

[I have been trying to get a new approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h42m57s)
01:42:57

[to segmentation working and I finally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m00s)
01:43:00

[got it working in the last day or two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m03s)
01:43:03

[they really wanted to show to you we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m04s)
01:43:04

[talked last week about dense net and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m06s)
01:43:06

[mentioned the sense net is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m09s)
01:43:09

[ass-kicking lis good at doing image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m12s)
01:43:12

[classification with a small number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m15s)
01:43:15

[data points like credibly good ah but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m17s)
01:43:17

[also mentioned that it's the basis of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m22s)
01:43:22

[this thing called 100 plate of tiramisu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m24s)
01:43:24

[which is an approach to segmentation so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m25s)
01:43:25

[segmentation refers to taking a picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m29s)
01:43:29

[of an image and figuring out you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m33s)
01:43:33

[where's the tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m36s)
01:43:36

[where's the dog where's the bicycle and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m38s)
01:43:38

[so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m40s)
01:43:40

[so it seems like we're not sure of NGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h43m42s)

[and if anybody's interested in asking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m18s)
01:44:18

[questions about the pipes watch version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m20s)

[hopefully Brendan will be happy to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m22s)
01:44:22

[answer them during the week so the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m24s)
01:44:24

[looks like this so there's an image and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m29s)
01:44:29

[then there's a show and then there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m34s)
01:44:34

[labels ok so that's basically what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m43s)
01:44:43

[looks like so you can see here you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m50s)
01:44:50

[got traffic lights you've got holes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m52s)
01:44:52

[you've got trees buildings or paths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m53s)
01:44:53

[roads interestingly the Dana step we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h44m57s)
01:44:57

[using is something called can bed and is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m02s)
01:45:02

[actually the data set is actually frames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m04s)
01:45:04

[from a video so a lot of the frames are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m06s)
01:45:06

[first in order each other and there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m08s)
01:45:08

[only like 600 frames in total so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m10s)
01:45:10

[very variable data and it can be data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m16s)
01:45:16

[set furthermore we're not going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m18s)
01:45:18

[any pre training so we're going to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m21s)
01:45:21

[and build a state-of-the-art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m24s)
01:45:24

[notification system on video which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m26s)
01:45:26

[already much lower information content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m29s)
01:45:29

[because most of the frames are pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m31s)
01:45:31

[similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m32s)
01:45:32

[using just eccentric frames without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m33s)
01:45:33

[pre-training now if you ask the amonth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m35s)
01:45:35

[ago I would have told you it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m37s)
01:45:37

[possible like this just seems like an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m38s)
01:45:38

[incredibly difficult into some but just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m41s)
01:45:41

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m44s)
01:45:44

[so I'm going to skip to the answer first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m46s)
01:45:46

[and here's an example of a particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m53s)
01:45:53

[frame we're trying to match here is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h45m56s)
01:45:56

[ground truth for that frame so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m02s)
01:46:02

[see there's a pony cart here and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m05s)
01:46:05

[little car here so there is little cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m08s)
01:46:08

[there's a tree you know trees are really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m10s)
01:46:10

[difficult right they're kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m13s)
01:46:13

[incredibly fine funny things and here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m14s)
01:46:14

[my trained model and as you can see it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m19s)
01:46:19

[done really really well right it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m23s)
01:46:23

[interesting to look at the mistakes that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m26s)
01:46:26

[made this little thing here is a person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m28s)
01:46:28

[but you can see that the person it kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m33s)
01:46:33

[of their hair looks a lot like traffic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m37s)
01:46:37

[life and the jacket looks a lot like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m38s)
01:46:38

[mailbox you know where else these tiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m40s)
01:46:40

[little people here it's done perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m43s)
01:46:43

[okay or very physically yeah or else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m46s)
01:46:46

[this person got a little bit confused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m52s)
01:46:52

[okay another example of where it gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m54s)
01:46:54

[wrong is this should be a road or else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m56s)
01:46:56

[it wasn't quite sure what was road and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h46m59s)
01:46:59

[what was footpath which makes sense kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m00s)
01:47:00

[of the colors do look very similar but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m03s)
01:47:03

[had we have pre-trained something a pre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m05s)
01:47:05

[train network would have understood that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m09s)
01:47:09

[you know cross roads tender go straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m11s)
01:47:11

[across they don't tend to look like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m13s)
01:47:13

[right so you can kind of see this you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m16s)
01:47:16

[know where this minor mistakes it made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m19s)
01:47:19

[say I also would have learned and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m21s)
01:47:21

[looked at more than you know a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m24s)
01:47:24

[hundred exams to people that people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m26s)
01:47:26

[generally are a particular shape but so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m28s)
01:47:28

[this is not enough data for actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m31s)
01:47:31

[learn some of these things but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m32s)
01:47:32

[nonetheless it is extraordinarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m34s)
01:47:34

[affected you know like look at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m35s)
01:47:35

[traffic light has kind of surrounded by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m38s)
01:47:38

[a sign so like the ground truth actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m41s)
01:47:41

[has the traffic light and then a tiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m44s)
01:47:44

[little edge of sign and like it's even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m46s)
01:47:46

[got that right you know so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m48s)
01:47:48

[incredibly accurate model so how does it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m52s)
01:47:52

[work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m56s)
01:47:56

[and in particular how to do these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m56s)
01:47:56

[amazing trees so the answer is companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h47m58s)
01:47:58

[picture Thank You Klee until um this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m04s)
01:48:04

[inspired by model called unit until the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m11s)
01:48:11

[unit model came along everybody was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m14s)
01:48:14

[doing these kinds of segmentation models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m17s)
01:48:17

[using an approach just like what we did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m20s)
01:48:20

[for style transfer which was basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m23s)
01:48:23

[you have a number of convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m25s)
01:48:25

[layers with max pooling or with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m30s)
01:48:30

[australia - which gradually make the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m33s)
01:48:33

[image smaller and smaller bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m35s)
01:48:35

[reception field and then you go back up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m38s)
01:48:38

[the other side using up sampling or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m40s)
01:48:40

[deconvolution until you get back to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m42s)
01:48:42

[original size and then your final layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m45s)
01:48:45

[is the same size as your starting layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m48s)
01:48:48

[and has a bunch of different classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m50s)
01:48:50

[that you're trying to use in the softmax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m52s)
01:48:52

[the problem with that is that you end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h48m57s)
01:48:57

[with effect I'll show you an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m01s)
01:49:01

[there's a really nice paper called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m04s)
01:49:04

[Annette Annette is not only an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m07s)
01:49:07

[incredibly accurate model for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m11s)
01:49:11

[segmentation but also incredibly fast it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m13s)
01:49:13

[actually can run in real time we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m16s)
01:49:16

[actually run it on the video but the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m19s)
01:49:19

[mistakes it makes sort of this chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m21s)
01:49:21

[right this chair has a big gap here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m22s)
01:49:22

[here and here but Annette gets a totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m25s)
01:49:25

[wrong right and the reason why is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m28s)
01:49:28

[because they use a very traditional you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m31s)
01:49:31

[know down sampling up sampling approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m33s)
01:49:33

[and by the time they get to the bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m36s)
01:49:36

[they've just lost track of the fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m38s)
01:49:38

[detail so the trick are these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m40s)
01:49:40

[connections here what we do is we start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m45s)
01:49:45

[low input we do a standard initial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m48s)
01:49:48

[convolution just like we did with cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m51s)
01:49:51

[transfer we then have a dense network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m53s)
01:49:53

[that Fisher knows about last week and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m55s)
01:49:55

[then that block okay we keep going down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h49m58s)
01:49:58

[we do a max falling track being more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m01s)
01:50:01

[dense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m03s)
01:50:03

[our next polling type things are going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m04s)
01:50:04

[down and then if we go up the other side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m06s)
01:50:06

[so we do a deconvolution dense block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m08s)
01:50:08

[deconvolution dense block we take the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m14s)
01:50:14

[output from the dense blocks on the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m17s)
01:50:17

[down so and we actually copy it over to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m19s)
01:50:19

[here and concatenate the two together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m23s)
01:50:23

[right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m25s)
01:50:25

[so actually Brendon a few days ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m27s)
01:50:27

[actually threw this on our whiteboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m31s)
01:50:31

[when we're explaining some Elissa and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m33s)
01:50:33

[he's shown us every stage here we start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m35s)
01:50:35

[out with a - 24 - 24 now this is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m37s)
01:50:37

[bream didn't think the Jeremy suit looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m40s)
01:50:40

[like despondently - 24 - 24 input go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m41s)
01:50:41

[through the convolutions for 48 filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m46s)
01:50:46

[go through a dense block at another 80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m48s)
01:50:48

[filters and then goes through our they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m50s)
01:50:50

[call it a transition down so basically a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h50m54s)

[by 7 and then on the way up again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m06s)
01:51:06

[we go transition up it's now 14 by 14 we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m09s)
01:51:09

[copy across the results of the 14 by 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m12s)
01:51:12

[from the transition down and concatenate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m15s)
01:51:15

[together now into a dense block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m18s)
01:51:18

[transition up now 28 by 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m21s)
01:51:21

[so a copy across there 28 by 28 from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m23s)
01:51:23

[transition down and so forth so by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m27s)
01:51:27

[time we get all the way back up here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m29s)
01:51:29

[we're actually copying across something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m31s)
01:51:31

[that was originally of size 224 by 224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m35s)
01:51:35

[and haven't had much done to it right it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m39s)
01:51:39

[had only been through one convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m42s)
01:51:42

[layer and one dense block that haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m45s)
01:51:45

[really got much rich computation being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m47s)
01:51:47

[done but the thing is because by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m49s)
01:51:49

[time it gets back up all the way up here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m52s)
01:51:52

[the model knows pretty much you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m55s)
01:51:55

[this is a tree and this is the person in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h51m58s)
01:51:58

[the house and it just needs to get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m00s)
01:52:00

[fine little details you know where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m02s)
01:52:02

[exactly does this leaf finish where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m04s)
01:52:04

[exactly to the person's hat finish so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m06s)
01:52:06

[it's basically copying across something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m08s)
01:52:08

[which is very high resolution that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m11s)
01:52:11

[doesn't have that much rich information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m14s)
01:52:14

[but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m16s)
01:52:16

[fine because it really only needs to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m17s)
01:52:17

[fill in the details but so these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m19s)
01:52:19

[here they're called skip connections but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m21s)
01:52:21

[they're really inspired by this paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m23s)
01:52:23

[called unit which has been you know one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m25s)
01:52:25

[mini careful competitions - using dense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m28s)
01:52:28

[blocks rather than normal feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m33s)
01:52:33

[connected blocks so let me show you and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m35s)
01:52:35

[you know we're looking not going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m41s)
01:52:41

[phones going to this in detail but I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m42s)
01:52:42

[done all this coding chaos from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m45s)
01:52:45

[this is actually like a fantastic to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m47s)
01:52:47

[care a certain have to create any custom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m50s)
01:52:50

[layers and if we have to do anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m52s)
01:52:52

[weird at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m53s)
01:52:53

[oh except for one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m55s)
01:52:55

[data augmentation so the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h52m58s)
01:52:58

[augmentation was we start with 480 by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m01s)
01:53:01

[360 images we randomly crop some 224 by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m05s)
01:53:05

[224 part and also randomly we left click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m10s)
01:53:10

[at horizontally that's all perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m13s)
01:53:13

[fine well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m15s)
01:53:15

[caris doesn't really have the random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m18s)
01:53:18

[drops unfortunately but more importantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m19s)
01:53:19

[whatever we do to the input image we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m22s)
01:53:22

[also have to do it as a target inch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m24s)
01:53:24

[please get a third same 224 perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m26s)
01:53:26

[for crop we need to do the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m29s)
01:53:29

[horizontal clip so I have to write a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m31s)
01:53:31

[data generator which you guys may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m35s)
01:53:35

[actually find useful anyway so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m42s)
01:53:42

[my data generator basically I call it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m44s)
01:53:44

[segment generator and it's just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m48s)
01:53:48

[standard generator so it's got a next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m52s)
01:53:52

[function right then each time you call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m53s)
01:53:53

[next you have some random bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m56s)
01:53:56

[indexes it goes through each one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h53m58s)
01:53:58

[those indexes and grabs the necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m02s)
01:54:02

[item grabbing a random slice sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m04s)
01:54:04

[randomly flipping it horizontally and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m08s)
01:54:08

[then doing this to both the X is n for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m10s)
01:54:10

[the Y's returning them back along with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m13s)
01:54:13

[this segment generator in order to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m19s)
01:54:19

[randomly grab grab a batch of random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m21s)
01:54:21

[indices each time I created this little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m25s)
01:54:25

[class called batch indices which can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m28s)
01:54:28

[basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m30s)
01:54:30

[please do that and it can have a shuffle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m31s)
01:54:31

[true or shuffle false so this this pair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m35s)
01:54:35

[of classes you guys might find really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m38s)
01:54:38

[helpful for creating your own data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m41s)
01:54:41

[generator this batch indices class in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m42s)
01:54:42

[particular you know now that I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m45s)
01:54:45

[written it you can see how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m47s)
01:54:47

[right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m49s)
01:54:49

[like I say batch indices from a data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m50s)
01:54:50

[of size 10 I want to grab 3 indices at a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m54s)
01:54:54

[time so then let's grab five batches now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h54m56s)
01:54:56

[in this case I've got by default shuffle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m01s)
01:55:01

[equals false](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m03s)
01:55:03

[so just returns Oh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m03s)
01:55:03

[finished commence at a 1/2 okay on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m07s)
01:55:07

[other hand if I say shuffle equals true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m11s)
01:55:11

[it returns them in random order but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m13s)
01:55:13

[still makes sure it captures all of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m15s)
01:55:15

[right and then we're done if it starts a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m17s)
01:55:17

[new random order okay so this makes it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m20s)
01:55:20

[really easy to create random generators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m22s)
01:55:22

[so that was the only thing I had to add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m25s)
01:55:25

[to care us to get this sort of work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m28s)
01:55:28

[other than that you know we wrote the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m31s)
01:55:31

[tiramisu and the tiramisu looked very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m35s)
01:55:35

[very similar to the density that we saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m38s)
01:55:38

[last week right except we've got all our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m40s)
01:55:40

[pieces the value to drop out the batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m44s)
01:55:44

[norm the irelia on top of batch norm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m48s)
01:55:48

[concat layer so this is something you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m52s)
01:55:52

[had to add my convolution to d followed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m55s)
01:55:55

[by drop out and then finally my batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h55m58s)
01:55:58

[norm Paula values followed by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m00s)
01:56:00

[convolution to D so this is just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m02s)
01:56:02

[dense blocks that we saw last week so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m06s)
01:56:06

[dense block is something where we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m09s)
01:56:09

[keep grabbing twelve or sixteen filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m10s)
01:56:10

[at a time concatenated them to the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m14s)
01:56:14

[set and doing that a few times that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m15s)
01:56:15

[what this block is so here's something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m19s)
01:56:19

[interesting the original paper or it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m23s)
01:56:23

[down sampling before transition down did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m29s)
01:56:29

[a a one by one convolution followed by a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m33s)
01:56:33

[max falling and I actually discovered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m39s)
01:56:39

[that doing a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m43s)
01:56:43

[strive to convolution gives better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m44s)
01:56:44

[results so you'll see I actually have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m46s)
01:56:46

[not followed the paper so the one that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m49s)
01:56:49

[in comments comes without fear is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m51s)
01:56:51

[the paper did but actually it is works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m53s)
01:56:53

[better that was interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m56s)
01:56:56

[interestingly though on the transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h56m59s)
01:56:59

[upside to remember that checkerboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m04s)
01:57:04

[artifact blog post free we saw that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m06s)
01:57:06

[shows that up sampling 2d followed by a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m10s)
01:57:10

[convolutional layer works better it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m12s)
01:57:12

[not work better if it is in fact a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m15s)
01:57:15

[deconvolution works better that is so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m18s)
01:57:18

[that's why you can see opal is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m21s)
01:57:21

[deconvolution layer but i thought that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m23s)
01:57:23

[was interesting so basically you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m25s)
01:57:25

[when I go down sampling a bunch of times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m31s)
01:57:31

[it's basically do a dense block and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m34s)
01:57:34

[I have to keep track of my skip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m37s)
01:57:37

[connections that's right so basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m39s)
01:57:39

[keep a list of all of those kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m40s)
01:57:40

[connections but they're going to hang on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m42s)
01:57:42

[to all of these so every one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m45s)
01:57:45

[get connections like just stick in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m47s)
01:57:47

[little rain right appending them after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m49s)
01:57:49

[every dense block right and so then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m52s)
01:57:52

[keep them all and then I pass them to my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m54s)
01:57:54

[upward path ok so I basically do my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h57m58s)
01:57:58

[transition up and then I can catenate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m01s)
01:58:01

[that with that skip connection okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m03s)
01:58:03

[that's the basic approach and so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m09s)
01:58:09

[the actual terribie to model itself with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m12s)
01:58:12

[those pieces is less than the street of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m16s)
01:58:16

[code right basically just to actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m18s)
01:58:18

[very con do my down paths do my up path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m20s)
01:58:20

[using those get connections then one by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m24s)
01:58:24

[one times at the end and a soft map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m28s)
01:58:28

[ok um so these dense nets and indeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m34s)
01:58:34

[this stuff is kind of a full fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m41s)
01:58:41

[convolutional dense net or at least some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m44s)
01:58:44

[term is to model they actually take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m45s)
01:58:45

[quite a long time to train they don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m48s)
01:58:48

[have very many parameters which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m50s)
01:58:50

[thinking why I think they work so well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m51s)
01:58:51

[with these tiny datasets but they do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m53s)
01:58:53

[still take a long time to train each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m55s)
01:58:55

[epoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m56s)
01:58:56

[minutes and in the end I have to do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h58m58s)
01:58:58

[know many hundreds of epochs and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m01s)
01:59:01

[know I was also doing there you know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m05s)
01:59:05

[bunch of learning rate and kneeling so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m06s)
01:59:06

[in the end this kind of really had to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m09s)
01:59:09

[Train overnight even though I had only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m10s)
01:59:10

[about five or six hundred friends but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m12s)
01:59:12

[you know in the end training training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m16s)
01:59:16

[training training in the end I got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m22s)
01:59:22

[really good result now interest I was a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m33s)
01:59:33

[bit nervous at first like getting this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m37s)
01:59:37

[like 87.6%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m38s)
01:59:38

[accuracy but in the model in the paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m40s)
01:59:40

[though again getting 90% plus it turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m43s)
01:59:43

[out that 3% of the pixels are marked as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m46s)
01:59:46

[per week I don't know why they make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m49s)
01:59:49

[sense for you but in the paper and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m50s)
01:59:50

[actually remove them so you'll see when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m52s)
01:59:52

[you get to my results section I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m54s)
01:59:54

[this bit where I remove those void ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=01h59m56s)
01:59:56

[and I ended up with eighty nine and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m00s)
02:00:00

[half percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m02s)
02:00:02

[mummy busting class managed to replicate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m04s)
02:00:04

[the paper the paper got 91 and a half or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m08s)
02:00:08

[nine 11.2% we tried the lasagna cosy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m13s)
02:00:13

[provided we tried a Brendon high scorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m16s)
02:00:16

[we tried my Claire us even though we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m19s)
02:00:19

[couldn't replicate their result this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m23s)
02:00:23

[still better than any other result I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m25s)
02:00:25

[found so this is still super accurate a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m27s)
02:00:27

[couple of quick notes fellas first you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m34s)
02:00:34

[they track training also on thing called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m38s)
02:00:38

[the g8x data set and just another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m41s)
02:00:41

[data set the degree to which this is an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m42s)
02:00:42

[amazing model is really clear here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m46s)
02:00:46

[there's 76% it's from a model which has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m49s)
02:00:49

[specifically built to video so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m53s)
02:00:53

[actually includes the time component](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m55s)
02:00:55

[which is absolutely critical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m57s)
02:00:57

[and it uses a pre train network so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h00m58s)
02:00:58

[used like a million images to kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m01s)
02:01:01

[pre train and it's still not as good as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m03s)
02:01:03

[this model right so like that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m07s)
02:01:07

[extraordinary comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m08s)
02:01:08

[and this is the cam tech comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m10s)
02:01:10

[here's the model we were just looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m14s)
02:01:14

[and again I actually looked into this I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m16s)
02:01:16

[thought oh 91 in the half or else this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m19s)
02:01:19

[one here 88 Wow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m22s)
02:01:22

[it actually looks like it's not that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m24s)
02:01:24

[much better I'm really surprised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m27s)
02:01:27

[like even tree like I really thought it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m29s)
02:01:29

[should win easily on tree but it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m32s)
02:01:32

[win very much so I actually went back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m34s)
02:01:34

[and got for this paper and it turns out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m36s)
02:01:36

[that the authors of the internet paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m39s)
02:01:39

[this is the tapir by the way Lonsdale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m41s)
02:01:41

[that they're comparison comparing to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m43s)
02:01:43

[turned out that they actually trained on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m47s)
02:01:47

[crops at 85 to buy 85 - so they actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m50s)
02:01:50

[use like a way higher resolution image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m54s)
02:01:54

[to start with so like you've got to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m57s)
02:01:57

[really careful when you read these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h01m59s)
02:01:59

[comparisons sometimes like people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m01s)
02:02:01

[actually kind of shoot themselves in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m04s)
02:02:04

[foot so these guys were comparing their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m05s)
02:02:05

[result to another model that was using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m07s)
02:02:07

[like twice as bigger picture so again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m10s)
02:02:10

[this is actually way better than they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m15s)
02:02:15

[actually did it look like another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m17s)
02:02:17

[like this one here it is 88 also looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m19s)
02:02:19

[impressive but then I looked across here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m22s)
02:02:22

[and I noticed that the dilution dilution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m24s)
02:02:24

[8 model is like way better than this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m28s)
02:02:28

[model on every single category way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m31s)
02:02:31

[better and yet somehow the average is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m34s)
02:02:34

[only point-three better and then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m37s)
02:02:37

[realized ok this actually has to be an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m38s)
02:02:38

[error right so this model is actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m40s)
02:02:40

[lot better than this this table gives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m44s)
02:02:44

[the impression so I briefly mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m48s)
02:02:48

[that there's a model which doesn't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m57s)
02:02:57

[any skip connections caught in it which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h02m59s)
02:02:59

[is actually better than the pyramus - on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m02s)
02:03:02

[everything except for tree but on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m05s)
02:03:05

[tree it's terrible in seventy seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m08s)
02:03:08

[point eight versus I am pleased every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m10s)
02:03:10

[tree all right okay I took that back I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m16s)
02:03:16

[sure it was less good than this model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m24s)
02:03:24

[but now I can't find that data anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m27s)
02:03:27

[the reason was to mention this is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m32s)
02:03:32

[Virginia is about to release a new model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m34s)
02:03:34

[which combines these approaches with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m40s)
02:03:40

[skip connections called link next so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m44s)
02:03:44

[know keep an eye on the forms I'll be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m47s)
02:03:47

[like looking into that quite shortly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m48s)
02:03:48

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m52s)
02:03:52

[you got something Rachel you have a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m54s)
02:03:54

[short questions as I know we're almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m57s)
02:03:57

[out of time energy yeah let's answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h03m58s)
02:03:58

[them in the forum because like really um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m01s)
02:04:01

[you know I actually wanted to talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m04s)
02:04:04

[this basically a lot of you have come up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m06s)
02:04:06

[to me and being like oh we're finishing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m11s)
02:04:11

[what do we do now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m13s)
02:04:13

[and the answer is you know we have now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m15s)
02:04:15

[created a community of all these people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m20s)
02:04:20

[who have spent well over 100 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m23s)
02:04:23

[working on deep learning for many many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m25s)
02:04:25

[months and have filtering boxes and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m28s)
02:04:28

[written blog posts and you know done all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m31s)
02:04:31

[kinds of stuff you know set up social](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m36s)
02:04:36

[impact talks written articles and forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m39s)
02:04:39

[like ok this communities happened right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m44s)
02:04:44

[so it doesn't make any sense in my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m48s)
02:04:48

[opinion for Rachel and I to now be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m50s)
02:04:50

[saying like is what happens next right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m52s)
02:04:52

[so just like Elena has decided okay I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m55s)
02:04:55

[want a book club so she took the Lindy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h04m59s)
02:04:59

[and we now have a book club a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h05m01s)
02:05:01

[Monday's time you can all come to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NYPQw5THU#t=02h05m03s)
02:05:03
