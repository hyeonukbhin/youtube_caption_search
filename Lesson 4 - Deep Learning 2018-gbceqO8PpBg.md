[know maybe those parts of the post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h01m24s)
00:01:24

[period where people have said actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h01m26s)
00:01:26

[that's not quite how it works and people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h01m27s)
00:01:27

[have learnt new things that way people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h01m29s)

[kind of a nice introductory level I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m05s)
00:02:05

[think really really kind of clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m07s)
00:02:07

[intuition many Cantor talk specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m09s)
00:02:09

[about differential learning rates and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m13s)

[with transfer learning you're not going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m20s)
00:02:20

[right back to saying like or what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m22s)
00:02:22

[transfer learning why is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m23s)
00:02:23

[interesting and given that why good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m25s)
00:02:25

[differential learning rates be helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m28s)
00:02:28

[and then one thing I particularly liked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m31s)
00:02:31

[about arjen's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m34s)
00:02:34

[article was that he talked not just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m35s)
00:02:35

[about the technology that we're looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m38s)
00:02:38

[at but also talked about some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m39s)
00:02:39

[implications particularly from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m42s)
00:02:42

[commercial point of view so thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m44s)
00:02:44

[about like based on some of the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[we've learned about so far what are some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m48s)
00:02:48

[of the implications that that has you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m50s)
00:02:50

[know in real life and lots of background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[lots of pictures and then discussing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m54s)
00:02:54

[some of the yeah some of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m58s)
00:02:58

[implications so there's been lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h02m59s)
00:02:59

[great stuff online and thanks to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m02s)
00:03:02

[everybody for all the great work that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m04s)
00:03:04

[you've been doing as we talked about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m06s)
00:03:06

[last week if you're kind of vaguely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m09s)
00:03:09

[wondering about writing something but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m12s)
00:03:12

[you're feeling a bit intimidated about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m13s)
00:03:13

[it because you've never really written a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m15s)
00:03:15

[technical post before just jump in you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m16s)
00:03:16

[know it's it's it's it's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m19s)
00:03:19

[welcoming and encouraging group I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[to to work with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m25s)
00:03:25

[so we're going to have a kind of an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m30s)
00:03:30

[interesting lesson today which is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m32s)
00:03:32

[going to cover a whole lot of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m34s)
00:03:34

[applications so we've we've spent quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m39s)
00:03:39

[a lot of time on computer vision and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m41s)
00:03:41

[today we're going to try if we can to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m42s)
00:03:42

[get through three totally different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m45s)
00:03:45

[areas structured learning so looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[kind of how you look at so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m51s)
00:03:51

[to start out looking at structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m54s)
00:03:54

[learning or structured data learning by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m55s)
00:03:55

[which I mean building models on top of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h03m58s)
00:03:58

[things look more like database tables so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m02s)
00:04:02

[kind of columns of different types of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m05s)
00:04:05

[data there might be financial or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m07s)
00:04:07

[geographical or whatever we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[look at using deep learning for language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m12s)
00:04:12

[natural language processing and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m14s)
00:04:14

[going to look at using deep learning for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m17s)
00:04:17

[recommendation systems and so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m19s)
00:04:19

[going to cover these at a very high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m21s)
00:04:21

[level and the focus will be on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m24s)
00:04:24

[here's how to use the software to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m28s)
00:04:28

[more then here is what's going on behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m31s)
00:04:31

[the scenes and then the next three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m33s)
00:04:33

[lessons we'll be digging into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m35s)
00:04:35

[details of what's been going on behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m38s)
00:04:38

[the scenes and also coming back to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m39s)
00:04:39

[looking at a lot of the details of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m42s)
00:04:42

[computer vision that we've kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m44s)
00:04:44

[skipped over so far so the focus today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m46s)
00:04:46

[is really on like how do you actually do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m49s)
00:04:49

[these applications and we'll kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m52s)
00:04:52

[talk briefly about some of the concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m54s)
00:04:54

[involved before we do I did want to talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h04m56s)
00:04:56

[about one key new concept which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m01s)
00:05:01

[dropout and you might have seen dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m07s)
00:05:07

[mentioned a bunch of times already and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m09s)
00:05:09

[got there got the impression that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m11s)
00:05:11

[is something important and indeed it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m12s)
00:05:12

[so look at dropout I'm going to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m14s)
00:05:14

[the dog breeds current cable competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m17s)
00:05:17

[that's going on and what I've done is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m22s)
00:05:22

[I've gone ahead and I've created a pre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m25s)
00:05:25

[train network as per usual and I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m28s)
00:05:28

[passed in pre compute equals true and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m31s)
00:05:31

[that's going to pre compute the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m33s)
00:05:33

[activations that come out of the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m36s)
00:05:36

[convolutional layer remember an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m38s)
00:05:38

[activation is just a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m40s)
00:05:40

[it's a number just to remind you an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m42s)
00:05:42

[activation like here is one activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m45s)
00:05:45

[it's a number and specifically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m48s)
00:05:48

[activations are calculated based on some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m51s)
00:05:51

[weights also called parameters that make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m53s)
00:05:53

[up kernels or filters and they get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h05m57s)
00:05:57

[applied to the previous layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m00s)
00:06:00

[activations but it could well be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m02s)
00:06:02

[inputs or they could themselves be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m05s)
00:06:05

[results of other calculations okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m07s)
00:06:07

[when we say activation keep remembering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m09s)
00:06:09

[we're talking about a number that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m11s)
00:06:11

[being calculated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m12s)
00:06:12

[so we've pre compute some activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m14s)
00:06:14

[and then what we do is we put on top of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m17s)
00:06:17

[that a bunch of additional initially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m20s)
00:06:20

[randomly generated fully connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m23s)
00:06:23

[layers so we're just going to do some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m26s)
00:06:26

[matrix multiplications on top of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m27s)
00:06:27

[just like in our Excel worksheet at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m29s)
00:06:29

[very end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m32s)
00:06:32

[we had this matrix that we just did a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m35s)
00:06:35

[matrix multiplication but so what you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m38s)
00:06:38

[can actually do is if you just type the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m43s)
00:06:43

[name of your loner object you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m46s)
00:06:46

[actually see what's in it you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m48s)
00:06:48

[the layers in it so when I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m50s)
00:06:50

[previously been skipping over a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m52s)
00:06:52

[bit about are we add a few layers to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m54s)
00:06:54

[end these are actually the layers of yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m56s)
00:06:56

[we're going to do batch norm in the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h06m58s)
00:06:58

[lesson so don't worry about that for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m01s)
00:07:01

[a linear layer simply means a matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m02s)
00:07:02

[multiply okay so this is a matrix which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m06s)
00:07:06

[has a 1024 rows and 512 columns and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m08s)
00:07:08

[in other words it's going to take in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m13s)
00:07:13

[1024 activations and spit out 512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m14s)
00:07:14

[activations then we have a rail unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m18s)
00:07:18

[which remember is just replace the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m22s)
00:07:22

[negatives with 0 we'll skip over the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m23s)
00:07:23

[batch norm we'll come back drop out then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m26s)
00:07:26

[we have a second linear layer that takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m29s)
00:07:29

[those 512 activations from the previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m30s)
00:07:30

[linear layer and puts them through a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m33s)
00:07:33

[matrix multiply 5 12 by 120 it spits out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m35s)
00:07:35

[a new 120 activations and then finally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m39s)
00:07:39

[put that through soft mats and for those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m42s)
00:07:42

[of you that don't remember softmax we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m45s)
00:07:45

[looked at that last year last week it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m47s)
00:07:47

[this idea that we basically just take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[the the activation let's say the dog go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m53s)
00:07:53

[e to the power of that and then divide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m57s)
00:07:57

[that into the sum of e to the power of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[all the intermissions so that was the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m02s)
00:08:02

[thing that adds up to one all of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m03s)
00:08:03

[add up to one and each one individually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m05s)
00:08:05

[is between 0 and 1 ok so that's that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[what we added on top and that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m12s)
00:08:12

[thing when we have pre computed calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m14s)
00:08:14

[true that's the thing we trained so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m15s)
00:08:15

[wanted to talk about what this dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m17s)
00:08:17

[is and what this key is because it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m19s)
00:08:19

[really important thing that we get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m21s)
00:08:21

[choose so a dropout layer with P equals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m24s)
00:08:24

[0.5 literally does this we go over to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m27s)
00:08:27

[our spreadsheet and let's pick any layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m30s)
00:08:30

[with some activations and let's say ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m32s)
00:08:32

[I'm going to apply dropout with a P of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m34s)
00:08:34

[0.5 to con true what that means is I go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m37s)
00:08:37

[through and with a 50% chance I pick a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m41s)
00:08:41

[cell right pick an activation so I kept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m46s)
00:08:46

[like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m48s)
00:08:48

[half of them randomly and I delete them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m48s)
00:08:48

[okay that's that's what dropout is right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m53s)
00:08:53

[so it's so the P equals 0.5 means what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h08m57s)
00:08:57

[the probability of deleting that cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m01s)
00:09:01

[all right so when I delete those cells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m03s)
00:09:03

[if you have a log like look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m08s)
00:09:08

[output it doesn't actually change by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[very much at all just a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m13s)
00:09:13

[particularly because remember it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m15s)
00:09:15

[getting through a Mac spalling layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m16s)
00:09:16

[right so it's only going to change it at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m17s)
00:09:17

[all if it was actually the maximum in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m19s)
00:09:19

[that group of four and furthermore it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m22s)
00:09:22

[just one piece of you know if it's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m25s)
00:09:25

[into a convolution rather than into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[max Paul is just one piece of that that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m29s)
00:09:29

[filter so interestingly the idea of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m32s)
00:09:32

[randomly throwing away half of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[activations in a layer has a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m39s)
00:09:39

[interesting result and one important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m43s)
00:09:43

[thing to mention is each mini batch we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m46s)
00:09:46

[throw away a different random half of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[activations earlier and so what it means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m53s)
00:09:53

[is it forces it to not over fit right in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h09m55s)
00:09:55

[other words if there's some particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[activation that's really learnt just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m02s)
00:10:02

[that exact that exact dog or that exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m04s)
00:10:04

[cat right then when that gets dropped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m08s)
00:10:08

[out the whole thing now isn't going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m11s)
00:10:11

[work as well it's not going to recognize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m14s)
00:10:14

[that image right so it has to in order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m15s)
00:10:15

[for this to work it has to try and find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m18s)
00:10:18

[a representation that that actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m21s)
00:10:21

[continues to work even as random half of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m25s)
00:10:25

[the activations get thrown away every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m28s)
00:10:28

[time all right so it's a it's it's I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m31s)
00:10:31

[guess about four years old now three or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m34s)
00:10:34

[four years old and it's been absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m36s)
00:10:36

[critical in making modern deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m41s)
00:10:41

[work and the reason why is it really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m44s)
00:10:44

[just about solve the problem of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m47s)
00:10:47

[generalization for us before drop out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[came along if you try to train a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m52s)
00:10:52

[with lots of parameters and you were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m56s)
00:10:56

[overfitting and you already tried all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h10m59s)
00:10:59

[the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m02s)
00:11:02

[imitation you could and you already had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m02s)
00:11:02

[as much data as you could you there were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m05s)
00:11:05

[some other things you could try but to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m08s)
00:11:08

[large degree you were kind of stuck okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m09s)
00:11:09

[and so then Geoffrey Hinton and his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m12s)
00:11:12

[colleagues came up with this this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m16s)
00:11:16

[dropout idea that was loosely inspired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m17s)
00:11:17

[by the way the brain works and also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m20s)
00:11:20

[loosely inspired by Geoffrey Hinton's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m23s)
00:11:23

[experience in bank teller Hugh's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m25s)
00:11:25

[apparently and yeah somehow they came up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m27s)
00:11:27

[with this amazing idea of like hey let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m31s)
00:11:31

[let's try throwing things away at random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[and so as you could imagine if your P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m35s)
00:11:35

[was like point O one then you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m40s)
00:11:40

[throwing away 1% of your activations for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m43s)
00:11:43

[that layer at random it's not gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m46s)
00:11:46

[randomly change things up very much at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m48s)
00:11:48

[all so it's not really going to protect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m51s)
00:11:51

[you from overfitting much at all on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m54s)
00:11:54

[other hand if your pain was 0.99 then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h11m58s)
00:11:58

[that would be like going through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m00s)
00:12:00

[whole thing and throwing away nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m02s)
00:12:02

[everything right and that would be very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m04s)
00:12:04

[hard for it to overfit so that would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m08s)
00:12:08

[great for generalization but it's also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m12s)
00:12:12

[going to kill your accuracy so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[kind of play off between high p-values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m17s)
00:12:17

[generalized well but will decrease your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m21s)
00:12:21

[training accuracy and low p-values will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m24s)
00:12:24

[generalize less well that will give you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m27s)
00:12:27

[a less good training accuracy so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m29s)
00:12:29

[those of you that have been wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m32s)
00:12:32

[why is it that particularly early in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m33s)
00:12:33

[training my validation losses better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m36s)
00:12:36

[than my training losses but which seems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m39s)
00:12:39

[otherwise really surprising hopefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m41s)
00:12:41

[some of you have been wondering why that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m44s)
00:12:44

[is because on a data set that it never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m45s)
00:12:45

[gets to see you wouldn't expect the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m48s)
00:12:48

[losses to ever be that's better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m50s)
00:12:50

[and the reason why is because when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m53s)
00:12:53

[look at the validation set we turn off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m55s)
00:12:55

[dropout right so in other words when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m57s)
00:12:57

[you're doing inference when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h12m59s)
00:12:59

[trying to say is this or cat or is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m01s)
00:13:01

[a dog we certainly don't want to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m02s)
00:13:02

[including random drop out there right we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m05s)
00:13:05

[want to be using the best model we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m07s)
00:13:07

[okay so that's why early in training in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m10s)
00:13:10

[particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m13s)
00:13:13

[actually see that our validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[accuracy and loss tends to be better if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m17s)
00:13:17

[we're using dropout okay so yes you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[you have to do anything to accommodate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[for the fact that you are throwing away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m28s)
00:13:28

[some that's a great question so we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m30s)
00:13:30

[that PI torch does so PI torch behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m35s)
00:13:35

[the scenes does two things if you say P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m38s)
00:13:38

[equals point five it throws away half of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m41s)
00:13:41

[the activations but it also doubles all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m43s)
00:13:43

[the activations that are already there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m49s)
00:13:49

[so when average the kind of the average](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m51s)
00:13:51

[activation doesn't change which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m53s)
00:13:53

[pretty pretty neat trick so yeah you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h13m56s)
00:13:56

[don't have to worry about it basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m00s)
00:14:00

[it's it's done for you so if we say so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m01s)
00:14:01

[you can pass in peas this is the this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m06s)
00:14:06

[the p value for all of the added layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m09s)
00:14:09

[to say with first AI what dropout do you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m12s)
00:14:12

[want on each of the layers in these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m16s)
00:14:16

[these added layers it won't change the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m18s)
00:14:18

[dropout in the pre trained network like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m20s)
00:14:20

[the hope is that that's already been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m23s)
00:14:23

[pretty trained with some appropriate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m25s)
00:14:25

[level of dropout we don't change it put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[on these layers that we add you can say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m29s)
00:14:29

[how much and so you can see here as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m31s)
00:14:31

[T's equals 0.5 so my first dropout has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m33s)
00:14:33

[0.5 my second dropout has 0.5 I remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m36s)
00:14:36

[coming to the input of this was the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[output of the last convolutional layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m44s)
00:14:44

[of pre-trained network and we go over it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m46s)
00:14:46

[and we actually throw away half of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[before you can start go through our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m50s)
00:14:50

[linear layer throw away the negatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m52s)
00:14:52

[throw away half the result of that go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m55s)
00:14:55

[through another linear layer and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h14m58s)
00:14:58

[pass it to our softness for minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m00s)
00:15:00

[numerical precision region reasons it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[turns out to be better to take the log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[of the softmax then softmax directly and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m09s)
00:15:09

[that's why you'll have noticed that when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m12s)
00:15:12

[you actually get predictions out of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[models you always have to go npx both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[the predictions but again the details as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m19s)
00:15:19

[to why aren't important so if we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m22s)
00:15:22

[try removing dropout we could go peas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m25s)
00:15:25

[equals zero all right and you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m28s)
00:15:28

[where else before we started with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m31s)
00:15:31

[point seven six accuracy in the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m32s)
00:15:32

[epoch now you could have point eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m34s)
00:15:34

[accuracy in the first debug alright so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m36s)
00:15:36

[by not doing drop out our first teapot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m38s)
00:15:38

[worked better not surprisingly because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m41s)
00:15:41

[we're not throwing anything away but by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m43s)
00:15:43

[the third epoch here we had eighty four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[point eight and here we have eighty four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m47s)
00:15:47

[point one so it started out better and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m50s)
00:15:50

[ended up worse so even after three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m52s)
00:15:52

[epochs you can already see where master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m54s)
00:15:54

[for overfitting right we've got point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m56s)
00:15:56

[three loss on the train and point five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h15m58s)
00:15:58

[loss on the validation yep and so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m01s)
00:16:01

[look now you can see in the resulting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m06s)
00:16:06

[model there's no drop out at all so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[the P is zero we don't even add it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m12s)
00:16:12

[the model another thing to mention is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m14s)
00:16:14

[you might have noticed that what we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m19s)
00:16:19

[been doing is we've been adding two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m21s)
00:16:21

[linear layers right in our additional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m23s)
00:16:23

[layers you don't have to do that by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[way there's actually a parameter called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m29s)
00:16:29

[extra fully connected layers that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m31s)
00:16:31

[can basically pass a list of how long do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m34s)
00:16:34

[you want or how big do you want each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m38s)
00:16:38

[the additional fully connected layers to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m40s)
00:16:40

[be and so by default well you need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m41s)
00:16:41

[have at least one right because you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m44s)
00:16:44

[something that takes the output of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m47s)
00:16:47

[convolutional layer which in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m49s)
00:16:49

[is of size thousand twenty-four and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m51s)
00:16:51

[turns it into the number of classes you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m52s)
00:16:52

[have cats versus dogs would be two dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m56s)
00:16:56

[breeds would be 120 planet satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h16m59s)
00:16:59

[seventeen whatever that's you always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m02s)
00:17:02

[need one linear layer at least and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m04s)
00:17:04

[can't pick how big that is that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m07s)
00:17:07

[defined by your problem but you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m08s)
00:17:08

[choose what the other size is or if it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m12s)
00:17:12

[happens at all so if we were to pass in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m14s)
00:17:14

[an empty list and now we're saying don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m16s)
00:17:16

[add any additional mini layers just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m19s)
00:17:19

[one that we have to have right so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m21s)
00:17:21

[we've got P is equals zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m24s)
00:17:24

[extra fully connected layers is empty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m25s)
00:17:25

[this is like the minimum possible kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m28s)
00:17:28

[of top model we can put on top and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m32s)
00:17:32

[like if we do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m36s)
00:17:36

[you can see above we actually end up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m40s)
00:17:40

[with in this case a reasonably good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m43s)
00:17:43

[result because we're not training it for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m45s)
00:17:45

[very long and this particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m47s)
00:17:47

[pre-trained Network is really well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m49s)
00:17:49

[suited to this particular problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m51s)
00:17:51

[yesterday so Jeremy what kind of piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m53s)
00:17:53

[should we were using by default so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h17m57s)
00:17:57

[one that's there by default for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m01s)
00:18:01

[first layer is 0.25 and for the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m05s)
00:18:05

[layer is 0.5 that seems to work pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m09s)
00:18:09

[well for most things right so like it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[it's it you don't necessarily need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m17s)
00:18:17

[change it at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m19s)
00:18:19

[basically if you find it's overfitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m20s)
00:18:20

[just start bumping it up so try first of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m22s)
00:18:22

[all setting it to 0.5 that'll set them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m26s)
00:18:26

[both to 0.5 if it still overfitting a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m28s)
00:18:28

[lot try 0.7 like you can you can narrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[down and like it's not that many numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m33s)
00:18:33

[change right and if you're under fitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m38s)
00:18:38

[then you can try and making it lower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m41s)
00:18:41

[it's unlikely you would need to make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m44s)
00:18:44

[much lower because like even in these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m47s)
00:18:47

[dogs versus cats situations you know we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m49s)
00:18:49

[don't see they have to make it lower so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m54s)
00:18:54

[it's more likely to be increasing at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m55s)
00:18:55

[about 0.6 0.7 but you can fiddle around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h18m57s)
00:18:57

[I find these the ones that are there by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m00s)
00:19:00

[defaults in work pretty well most of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[time so one place I actually did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m05s)
00:19:05

[increase this was in the dog breeds one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m08s)
00:19:08

[I did set it them both to 0.5 when I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m12s)
00:19:12

[used a bigger model so like ResNet 34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m15s)
00:19:15

[has less parameters so it doesn't over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m19s)
00:19:19

[fit as much but then when I started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m22s)
00:19:22

[bumping pumping it up to like a resonate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m23s)
00:19:23

[50 which has a lot more parameters and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m25s)
00:19:25

[noticed it started overfitting so then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m28s)
00:19:28

[also increased my drop out so as you use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m30s)
00:19:30

[like bigger models you'll often need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m32s)
00:19:32

[add more drama can you pass it over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m35s)
00:19:35

[there please you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m38s)
00:19:38

[if we set B to 0.5 roughly what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m42s)
00:19:42

[percentage is it 50%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m46s)
00:19:46

[we say RP pasta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m49s)
00:19:49

[is there a particular way in which you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m52s)
00:19:52

[can determine if the data is being all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m55s)
00:19:55

[fitted yeah you can see that the like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h19m57s)
00:19:57

[here you can see that the training error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[is a loss is much lower than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m06s)
00:20:06

[validation list you can't tell if it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m08s)
00:20:08

[like to over fitted like zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m11s)
00:20:11

[overfitting is not generally optimal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m16s)
00:20:16

[like the only way to find that out is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m18s)
00:20:18

[remember the only thing you're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m19s)
00:20:19

[do is to get this number low right the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m21s)
00:20:21

[validation loss number low so in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[you kind of have to play around with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[few different things and see which thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[ends up getting the validation loss low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m29s)
00:20:29

[but you kind of get a feel overtime for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m32s)
00:20:32

[your particular problem what does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m35s)
00:20:35

[overfitting what does too much River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m37s)
00:20:37

[fitting look like great so so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m38s)
00:20:38

[dropout and we're going to be using that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m45s)
00:20:45

[a lot and remember it's there by default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m47s)
00:20:47

[service here another question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[oh so I have two questions so one is so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m51s)
00:20:51

[when it says the dropout rate is 0.5 it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h20m56s)
00:20:56

[does it like you know I delete each cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m01s)
00:21:01

[with a probability of 0.5 or does it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[just pick 50% randomly I mean I know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m07s)
00:21:07

[both effectively is the 4-month yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m10s)
00:21:10

[okay okay a second question is why does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m12s)
00:21:12

[the average activation matter well it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[matters because the remember if you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m19s)
00:21:19

[the Excel spreadsheet that the result of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m22s)
00:21:22

[this cell for example is equal to these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m27s)
00:21:27

[nine multiplied by each of these nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m36s)
00:21:36

[right and add it up so if we deleted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m40s)
00:21:40

[half of these then that would also cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m42s)
00:21:42

[this number to half which would cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m45s)
00:21:45

[like everything else after that to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m48s)
00:21:48

[change and so if you change what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m50s)
00:21:50

[means you know like you then you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m53s)
00:21:53

[changing something that used to say like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m55s)
00:21:55

[Oh fluffy ears are fluffy if this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m56s)
00:21:56

[greater than point six now it's only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h21m59s)
00:21:59

[fluffy if it's greater than point three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m01s)
00:22:01

[like we're changing the meaning of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m02s)
00:22:02

[everything so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m03s)
00:22:03

[here is to delete things without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m05s)
00:22:05

[changing where are you using a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m07s)
00:22:07

[activation for one of the earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m14s)
00:22:14

[activations why are we using when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m16s)
00:22:16

[yeah why that particular activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m19s)
00:22:19

[because that's what this set of layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m21s)
00:22:21

[is so we've with the the pre-trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m23s)
00:22:23

[network is or is the convolutional net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m26s)
00:22:26

[work and that's pre computed so we don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m28s)
00:22:28

[see it so what that spits out is it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m31s)
00:22:31

[vector so the only choice we have is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m35s)
00:22:35

[use linear layers at this point okay can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m37s)
00:22:37

[we have different level of dropout by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m42s)
00:22:42

[layer yes absolutely how to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m44s)
00:22:44

[great so so you can absolutely have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m47s)
00:22:47

[different dropout by layer and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m51s)
00:22:51

[why this is actually called peas so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m53s)
00:22:53

[could pass in an array here so if I went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m56s)
00:22:56

[0 comma 0.2 for example and then extra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h22m58s)
00:22:58

[fully connecting it I might add 512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m03s)
00:23:03

[right then that's going to be 0 drop out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m05s)
00:23:05

[before the first of them and point to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m08s)
00:23:08

[drop out before the second of them yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m10s)
00:23:10

[requests and I must admit I don't have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m13s)
00:23:13

[great intuition even after doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m16s)
00:23:16

[for a few years for like when should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m19s)
00:23:19

[earlier or later layers have different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m22s)
00:23:22

[amounts of dropping out it's still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m25s)
00:23:25

[something I kind of play with and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m28s)
00:23:28

[can't quite find rules of thumb so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m30s)
00:23:30

[some of you come up with some good rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m32s)
00:23:32

[of thumb I'd love to hear about them I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m34s)
00:23:34

[think if in doubt you can use the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m36s)
00:23:36

[drop out and every fully connected layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m40s)
00:23:40

[the other thing you can try is often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m42s)
00:23:42

[people only put drop out on the very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m45s)
00:23:45

[last linear layer so there'd be the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m47s)
00:23:47

[things to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m49s)
00:23:49

[so Jeremy why do you monitor the log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m53s)
00:23:53

[loss the loss instead of the accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h23m57s)
00:23:57

[going up well because the loss is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m00s)
00:24:00

[only thing that we can see for both the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m03s)
00:24:03

[validation set in the training set so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m08s)
00:24:08

[it's nice to be able to compare them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m10s)
00:24:10

[also as we learn about later the loss is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m13s)
00:24:13

[the thing that we're actually optimizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m18s)
00:24:18

[so it's it's kind of a little more it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m21s)
00:24:21

[a little easier to monitor that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m25s)
00:24:25

[understand what that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m27s)
00:24:27

[can you pass it over there so with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m29s)
00:24:29

[drop out we're kind of adding some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m35s)
00:24:35

[random noise every iteration right you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m37s)
00:24:37

[know so that means that we don't do as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m39s)
00:24:39

[much learning yeah that's right so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m42s)
00:24:42

[doesn't seem to impact the learning rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m49s)
00:24:49

[enough thrive ever noticed it I I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m51s)
00:24:51

[say you're probably right in theory it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m54s)
00:24:54

[might but not enough that it's ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m56s)
00:24:56

[affected me okay so let's talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h24m58s)
00:24:58

[this structured data problem and so to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m06s)
00:25:06

[remind you we were looking at kegels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m10s)
00:25:10

[rossmann competition which is a German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m13s)
00:25:13

[chain of supermarkets I believe and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m17s)
00:25:17

[can find this in lesson three Russman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[and the main data set is the one where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m23s)
00:25:23

[we were looking to say at a particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m30s)
00:25:30

[store how much did they sell okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m32s)
00:25:32

[there's a few big key piece of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m36s)
00:25:36

[information one is what was the date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m38s)
00:25:38

[another was were they open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m40s)
00:25:40

[did they have a promotion on was it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m42s)
00:25:42

[holiday in that state and was it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m46s)
00:25:46

[holiday as for school a state holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[there wasn't a school holiday yeah and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[then we had some more information about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m53s)
00:25:53

[stores like what for this store what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m54s)
00:25:54

[kind of stuff did they tend to sell what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m57s)
00:25:57

[kind of store are they how far away the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h25m59s)
00:25:59

[competition and so forth so with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m01s)
00:26:01

[data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m04s)
00:26:04

[set like this there's really two main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m05s)
00:26:05

[kinds of column there's columns that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m07s)
00:26:07

[think of as categorical they have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m09s)
00:26:09

[number of levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m11s)
00:26:11

[so the assortment column is categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m12s)
00:26:12

[and it has levels such as a B and C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m16s)
00:26:16

[where else something like competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m20s)
00:26:20

[distance we will call continuous it has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m23s)
00:26:23

[a number attached to it where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m26s)
00:26:26

[differences or ratios even if that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m27s)
00:26:27

[number have some kind of meaning and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m29s)
00:26:29

[we need to deal with these two things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m32s)
00:26:32

[quite differently okay so anybody who's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[done any machine learning of any kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m37s)
00:26:37

[will be familiar with using continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m40s)
00:26:40

[columns if you've done any linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m42s)
00:26:42

[regression for example you can just like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m44s)
00:26:44

[modify them by parameters for instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m46s)
00:26:46

[categorical columns we're going to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m49s)
00:26:49

[to think about a little bit more we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m51s)
00:26:51

[not going to go through the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m54s)
00:26:54

[cleaning we're going to assume that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m55s)
00:26:55

[that's a feature Engineering we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m57s)
00:26:57

[to assume all that's been done and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h26m59s)
00:26:59

[basically at the end of that we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m03s)
00:27:03

[list of columns and the in this case I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m06s)
00:27:06

[didn't do any of the thinking around the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m10s)
00:27:10

[feature engineering or dedicating myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m14s)
00:27:14

[this is all directly from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m16s)
00:27:16

[third-place winners of this competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m18s)
00:27:18

[and so they came up with all of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m21s)
00:27:21

[different columns that they found useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m24s)
00:27:24

[and so you'll notice the list here is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m28s)
00:27:28

[list of the things that we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m33s)
00:27:33

[treat as categorical variables numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[like year a month and day although we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m39s)
00:27:39

[could treat them as continuous like they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m44s)
00:27:44

[the different you know differences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m46s)
00:27:46

[between 2000 and 2003 is meaningful we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m48s)
00:27:48

[don't have to right and you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m52s)
00:27:52

[shortly how how categorical variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h27m54s)
00:27:54

[are treated but basically if we decide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m00s)
00:28:00

[to make something a categorical variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m02s)
00:28:02

[what we're telling our neural net down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[the track is that for every different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m06s)
00:28:06

[level of say year you know 2000 2001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m08s)
00:28:08

[2002 you can treat it totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m12s)
00:28:12

[differently where else if we say it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m14s)
00:28:14

[continuous its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m16s)
00:28:16

[have to come up with some kind of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m18s)
00:28:18

[function some kind of smooth ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m20s)
00:28:20

[function right and so often even for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[things like a year that actually are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m26s)
00:28:26

[continuous but they don't actually have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[many distinct levels it often works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m30s)
00:28:30

[better to treat it as categorical so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m33s)
00:28:33

[another good example day of week right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m36s)
00:28:36

[so like day of week between naught &amp; 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m39s)
00:28:39

[it's a number and it means something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m42s)
00:28:42

[motifs between 3 &amp; 5 is two days and has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m45s)
00:28:45

[meaning but if you think about like how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m48s)
00:28:48

[word sales in a strawberry buy a day of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m50s)
00:28:50

[week it could well be that like you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m54s)
00:28:54

[Saturdays and Sundays are over here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m56s)
00:28:56

[Fridays are over here and Wednesdays are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h28m58s)
00:28:58

[over here like each day is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m00s)
00:29:00

[behave kind of qualitatively differently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m02s)
00:29:02

[right so by saying this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m05s)
00:29:05

[categorical variable as you'll see we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m07s)
00:29:07

[going to let the neural-net do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m10s)
00:29:10

[right so this thing where we get where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m13s)
00:29:13

[we say which are continuous in which a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m15s)
00:29:15

[categorical to some extent this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m18s)
00:29:18

[modeling decision you get to make now if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m20s)
00:29:20

[something is coded in your data is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m24s)
00:29:24

[a B and C or you know Jeremy and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[knit or whatever you actually you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m31s)
00:29:31

[going to have to call that categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m34s)
00:29:34

[right there's no way to treat that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m35s)
00:29:35

[directly as a continuous variable on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m37s)
00:29:37

[other hand if it starts out as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m40s)
00:29:40

[continuous variable like age or day of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[week you get to decide whether you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[to treat it as continuous or categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m49s)
00:29:49

[okay so summarize if it's categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m50s)
00:29:50

[and data it's going to have to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m53s)
00:29:53

[categorical in the model if it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m55s)
00:29:55

[continuous in the data you get to pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m57s)
00:29:57

[whether to make it continuous or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h29m59s)
00:29:59

[categorical in the model so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m01s)
00:30:01

[again what I just did whatever the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m05s)
00:30:05

[third-place winners of this competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m07s)
00:30:07

[did these are the ones that they decided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m08s)
00:30:08

[to use as categorical these were the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m11s)
00:30:11

[ones they decided to use as continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m12s)
00:30:12

[and you can see that basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m14s)
00:30:14

[continuous ones are all of the ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m18s)
00:30:18

[which are actual floating-point numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m20s)
00:30:20

[like competition distance actually has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m23s)
00:30:23

[decimal place to it right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m26s)
00:30:26

[temperature actually has a decimal place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m27s)
00:30:27

[to it so these would be very hard to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m29s)
00:30:29

[make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m31s)
00:30:31

[categorical because they have many many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m32s)
00:30:32

[levels right like if it's like five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m34s)
00:30:34

[digits of floating-point then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m37s)
00:30:37

[potentially there will be as many levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m39s)
00:30:39

[as there are as there are roads and by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[the way the word we use to say how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m46s)
00:30:46

[levels are in a category we use the word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m48s)
00:30:48

[cardinality right so if you see me say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m50s)
00:30:50

[cardinality example the cardinality of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m52s)
00:30:52

[the day of week variable is 7 because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m54s)
00:30:54

[there are 7 different days of the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h30m57s)
00:30:57

[do you have a heuristic for one to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m02s)
00:31:02

[been continuous variables or do you ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m04s)
00:31:04

[in variables I don't ever been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m06s)
00:31:06

[continuous variables so yeah so one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m07s)
00:31:07

[thing we could do with like max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m13s)
00:31:13

[temperature is group it into nought to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m14s)
00:31:14

[10 10 to 20 20 to 30 and then call that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m17s)
00:31:17

[categorical interestingly a paper just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m20s)
00:31:20

[came out last week in which a group of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m23s)
00:31:23

[researchers found that sometimes bidding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m27s)
00:31:27

[can be helpful but it literally came out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m29s)
00:31:29

[in the last week and until that time I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m32s)
00:31:32

[haven't seen anything in deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m33s)
00:31:33

[saying that so I haven't I haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m35s)
00:31:35

[looked at it myself until this week I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m37s)
00:31:37

[would have said it's a bad idea now I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m39s)
00:31:39

[have to think differently I guess maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m41s)
00:31:41

[it is sometimes so if you're using year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m43s)
00:31:43

[as a category what happens when you run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m52s)
00:31:52

[the model of a year it's never seen so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m55s)
00:31:55

[your training will get there yeah the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h31m57s)
00:31:57

[short answer is it will be treated as an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m00s)
00:32:00

[unknown category and so pandas which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m03s)
00:32:03

[the underlying data frame thinking we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m06s)
00:32:06

[using with categories as a special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m09s)
00:32:09

[category called unknown and if it stays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m11s)
00:32:11

[a category it hasn't seen before it gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m13s)
00:32:13

[treated as unknown so for AB deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m15s)
00:32:15

[learning model unknown will just be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m20s)
00:32:20

[another category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m22s)
00:32:22

[if our data set training the data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m25s)
00:32:25

[doesn't have a category and test has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[unknown how will it did you know just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[paper this unknown category it's still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m36s)
00:32:36

[predict it will predict something right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m39s)
00:32:39

[like it will just have the value 0 barn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m41s)
00:32:41

[scenes and if there's been any unknowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m44s)
00:32:44

[of any kind in the training set then it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m46s)
00:32:46

[off learnt a way to predict unknown if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m48s)
00:32:48

[it hasn't it's going to have some random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m52s)
00:32:52

[vector and so that's a interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m54s)
00:32:54

[detail around training that we probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h32m58s)
00:32:58

[want to talk about in this part of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m00s)
00:33:00

[course but we can certainly talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m01s)
00:33:01

[on the forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m02s)
00:33:02

[okay so we've got our categorical and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m05s)
00:33:05

[continuous variable lists defined in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m08s)
00:33:08

[this case there was eight hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m11s)
00:33:11

[thousand rows so eight hundred thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[dates basically by Storz and so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m16s)
00:33:16

[now take all of these columns look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m21s)
00:33:21

[through each one and replace it in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m26s)
00:33:26

[data frame where the version where you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m29s)
00:33:29

[say take it and change its type to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m31s)
00:33:31

[category okay and so that just that just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m33s)
00:33:33

[a panda's things so I'm not going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m37s)
00:33:37

[teach you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[pandas there's plenty of books so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m40s)
00:33:40

[particularly with McKinney's books book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m42s)
00:33:42

[on python for data analysis is great but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m44s)
00:33:44

[hopefully it's intuitive as to what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m48s)
00:33:48

[going on even if you haven't seen the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m49s)
00:33:49

[specific syntax before so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m51s)
00:33:51

[turn that column into a categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m53s)
00:33:53

[column and then for the continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m55s)
00:33:55

[variables we're going to make them all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h33m58s)
00:33:58

[32-bit floating-point and for the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m00s)
00:34:00

[for that is that pipe torch expects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m03s)
00:34:03

[everything to be 32-bit floating-point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m07s)
00:34:07

[okay so like some of these include like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m09s)
00:34:09

[1 0 things like I can't see them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[straight away but anyway so much yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m19s)
00:34:19

[like was there a promo was was a holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m21s)
00:34:21

[and so that'll become the floating point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m23s)
00:34:23

[values 1 and 0 for instance ok so I try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m25s)
00:34:25

[to do as much of my work as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m33s)
00:34:33

[on small data sets for when I'm working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m35s)
00:34:35

[with images that generally means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m39s)
00:34:39

[resizing the images to like 64 by 64 or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m40s)
00:34:40

[128 by 128 we can't do that with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m44s)
00:34:44

[structured data so instead I tend to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m48s)
00:34:48

[take a sample so I randomly pick a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m49s)
00:34:49

[rows so I start running with a sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m52s)
00:34:52

[and I can use exactly the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m55s)
00:34:55

[that we've seen before for getting a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m57s)
00:34:57

[validation set we can use the same way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h34m59s)
00:34:59

[to get some random random row numbers to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m01s)
00:35:01

[use in a random sample okay so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m04s)
00:35:04

[just a bunch of random numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m07s)
00:35:07

[and then okay so that's going to be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m13s)
00:35:13

[size 150,000 rather than 800 40,000 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m15s)
00:35:15

[so my data that before I go any further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m21s)
00:35:21

[it basically looks like this you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m23s)
00:35:23

[I've got some boolean x' here I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m25s)
00:35:25

[some integers here of various different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m28s)
00:35:28

[scales here's my year 2014 and I've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m32s)
00:35:32

[some letters here so even though I said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m37s)
00:35:37

[please call that a pandas category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m40s)
00:35:40

[pandas still displays that in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[notebook as strings right it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m45s)
00:35:45

[stored in internally differently so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m49s)
00:35:49

[the first day our library has a special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m52s)
00:35:52

[little function called processed data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m55s)
00:35:55

[frame and process data frame takes a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m56s)
00:35:56

[data frame and you tell it what's my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[dependent variable right and it does a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m02s)
00:36:02

[few different things the first thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m05s)
00:36:05

[it's pulled out that dependent variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m06s)
00:36:06

[and puts it into a separate variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m08s)
00:36:08

[okay and deletes it from the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m10s)
00:36:10

[data frame so DF now does not have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m13s)
00:36:13

[sales column in where else Y just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m16s)
00:36:16

[contains a sales column something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m18s)
00:36:18

[that it does is it does scaling so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m22s)
00:36:22

[neural nets really like to have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m25s)
00:36:25

[input data to all be somewhere around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m28s)
00:36:28

[zero with a standard deviation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[somewhere around one all right so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m33s)
00:36:33

[always take our data and subtract the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m35s)
00:36:35

[mean and divide by the standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m39s)
00:36:39

[deviation to make that happen so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m41s)
00:36:41

[what do see a littles true that's and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m43s)
00:36:43

[actually returns a special object which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m46s)
00:36:46

[keeps track of what mean and standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m48s)
00:36:48

[deviation did it use for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m50s)
00:36:50

[normalizing so you can then do the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m51s)
00:36:51

[thing to the test set later it also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m53s)
00:36:53

[handles missing values so missing values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h36m57s)
00:36:57

[and categorical variables just become](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m01s)
00:37:01

[the ID 0 and then all the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m04s)
00:37:04

[categories become 1 2 3 4 5 4 that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m07s)
00:37:07

[categorical variable for continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m09s)
00:37:09

[variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m12s)
00:37:12

[it replaces the missing value with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m13s)
00:37:13

[median and creates a new column that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m17s)
00:37:17

[boolean and just says is this missing or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m21s)
00:37:21

[not and I'm gonna skip over this pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m23s)
00:37:23

[quickly because we talked about this in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m24s)
00:37:24

[detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m26s)
00:37:26

[the machine learning course okay so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m27s)
00:37:27

[you've got any questions about this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m29s)
00:37:29

[that would be a good place to go it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m31s)
00:37:31

[nothing deep learning specific there so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m34s)
00:37:34

[you can see afterwards year 2014 for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m36s)
00:37:36

[example has become year two okay because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m39s)
00:37:39

[these categorical variables have all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m42s)
00:37:42

[been replaced with with contiguous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m43s)
00:37:43

[integers starting at zero and the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m47s)
00:37:47

[for that is later on we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m50s)
00:37:50

[putting them into a matrix right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m52s)
00:37:52

[we wouldn't want the matrix to be 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m55s)
00:37:55

[rows long when it could just be two rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m57s)
00:37:57

[one there so that's the basic idea there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h37m59s)
00:37:59

[and you'll see that the AC for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m02s)
00:38:02

[has been replaced in the same way with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[one and three okay so we now have a data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m08s)
00:38:08

[frame which does not contain the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m13s)
00:38:13

[dependent variable and where everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m15s)
00:38:15

[is a number okay and so that's that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m17s)
00:38:17

[that's where we need to get to to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[deep learning and all of the stage about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m21s)
00:38:21

[that as I said we talked about in detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m23s)
00:38:23

[in the machine learning course nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[deep learning specific about any of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m27s)
00:38:27

[this is exactly what we throw into our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m29s)
00:38:29

[random forests as well so another thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m32s)
00:38:32

[we talk about a lot in the machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m36s)
00:38:36

[learning core of course is validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m38s)
00:38:38

[sets in this case we need to predict the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m39s)
00:38:39

[next two weeks of sales right it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m44s)
00:38:44

[like pick a random set of sales but we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m47s)
00:38:47

[have to pick the next two weeks of sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m50s)
00:38:50

[that was what the cattle competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m52s)
00:38:52

[folks told us to do and therefore I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m54s)
00:38:54

[going to create a validation set which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m57s)
00:38:57

[is the last two weeks of my training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h38m59s)
00:38:59

[right to try and make it as similar to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m03s)
00:39:03

[the test set as possible and we just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m05s)
00:39:05

[posted actually Rachel wrote this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m08s)
00:39:08

[last week about creating validation sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m09s)
00:39:09

[so if you go too fast at AI you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m13s)
00:39:13

[check it out we'll put that in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m15s)
00:39:15

[lesson wiki as well but it's basically a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m17s)
00:39:17

[summary of a recent machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m20s)
00:39:20

[lesson that we did the videos are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m23s)
00:39:23

[available for that as well and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m27s)
00:39:27

[kind of a written a written summary of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m28s)
00:39:28

[it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m30s)
00:39:30

[so yeah so Rachel and I spend a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m35s)
00:39:35

[time thinking about kind of you know how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m38s)
00:39:38

[do you need to think about validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m40s)
00:39:40

[sets and training sets and test sets and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m41s)
00:39:41

[so forth and that's all there but again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m43s)
00:39:43

[nothing deep learning specific so let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m46s)
00:39:46

[get straight to the deep learning action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m48s)
00:39:48

[okay so in this particular competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m50s)
00:39:50

[as always with any competition or any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m55s)
00:39:55

[kind of machine learning project you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h39m58s)
00:39:58

[really need to make sure you have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m01s)
00:40:01

[strong understanding of your metric how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m02s)
00:40:02

[are you going to be judged here and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m06s)
00:40:06

[this case you know Carol makes it easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m08s)
00:40:08

[they tell us how we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m09s)
00:40:09

[judged and so we're going to be judged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m10s)
00:40:10

[on the roots mean squared percentage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m12s)
00:40:12

[error right so we're gonna say like oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m14s)
00:40:14

[you predicted three it was actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m17s)
00:40:17

[three point three so you were can sent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m21s)
00:40:21

[out and then we're gonna average all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m24s)
00:40:24

[those percents right and remember I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m25s)
00:40:25

[warned you that you are gonna need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m28s)
00:40:28

[make sure you know logarithms really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[well right and so in this case from you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m35s)
00:40:35

[know we're basically being saying your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m37s)
00:40:37

[prediction divided by the actual the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m40s)
00:40:40

[mean of that right is the thing that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m43s)
00:40:43

[care about and so we don't have a metric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[in play torch called root mean squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m52s)
00:40:52

[percent error we could actually easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m54s)
00:40:54

[create it by the way if you look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m56s)
00:40:56

[source code you'll see like it's you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h40m59s)
00:40:59

[know a line of code but easiest deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m01s)
00:41:01

[would be to realize that that if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m03s)
00:41:03

[have that right then you could replace a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m08s)
00:41:08

[with like log of a dash and be with like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m12s)
00:41:12

[log of B dash and then you can replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m16s)
00:41:16

[that whole thing with a subtraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m19s)
00:41:19

[that's just the rule of loaves right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m22s)
00:41:22

[so if you don't know that rule then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m26s)
00:41:26

[don't make sure you go look it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m28s)
00:41:28

[because it's super helpful but it means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m30s)
00:41:30

[in this case all we need to do is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m32s)
00:41:32

[take the log of our data which I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m35s)
00:41:35

[actually did earlier in this notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m39s)
00:41:39

[and when you take the log of the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m42s)
00:41:42

[getting the root mean squared error will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[actually get you there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m46s)
00:41:46

[means great percent error for free okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m47s)
00:41:47

[but then when we want to like print out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m50s)
00:41:50

[our it means percent error we actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m53s)
00:41:53

[have to go e ^ it again right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h41m56s)
00:41:56

[we can actually return the percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m00s)
00:42:00

[difference so that's all that's going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m02s)
00:42:02

[here it's again not really deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m04s)
00:42:04

[specific at all so here we finally get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m06s)
00:42:06

[to the deep learning alright so as per](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m11s)
00:42:11

[usual like you'll see everything we look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m14s)
00:42:14

[at today looks exactly the same as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[everything we've looked at so far which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m18s)
00:42:18

[is first we create a model data object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m20s)
00:42:20

[something that has a validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m22s)
00:42:22

[training set and optional test set built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m25s)
00:42:25

[into it from that we will get a learner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m28s)
00:42:28

[we will then optionally called learner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m30s)
00:42:30

[dot LR find real then called learner dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[fetch it'll be all the same parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m37s)
00:42:37

[and everything that you've seen many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m39s)
00:42:39

[times before okay so the difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m41s)
00:42:41

[though is obviously we're not going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m43s)
00:42:43

[go image classify a data dot from CSV or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m45s)
00:42:45

[dot from paths we need to get some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m50s)
00:42:50

[different kind of model data and so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m52s)
00:42:52

[stuff that is in rows and columns we use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m55s)
00:42:55

[columnar model data but this will return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h42m57s)
00:42:57

[an object with basically the same API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m00s)
00:43:00

[that you're familiar with and rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[than from paths or from CSV this is from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m05s)
00:43:05

[data frame okay so this gets passed a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m09s)
00:43:09

[few things the path here is just used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m12s)
00:43:12

[for it to know where should it store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m15s)
00:43:15

[like model files or stuff like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m17s)
00:43:17

[right this is just basically saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m20s)
00:43:20

[where do you want to store anything that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m22s)
00:43:22

[you saved later this is the list of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m23s)
00:43:23

[indexes of the rows that we want to put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m27s)
00:43:27

[in the validation set we created earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m29s)
00:43:29

[here's our data frame okay and then look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m31s)
00:43:31

[here's this is where we did the log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m39s)
00:43:39

[right so I took the the Y that came out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m41s)
00:43:41

[of property F our dependent variable I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m44s)
00:43:44

[logged it and I call that yl all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m46s)
00:43:46

[so we tell it when we create our model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m49s)
00:43:49

[data we need to tell it that's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m52s)
00:43:52

[dependent variable okay so so far we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m53s)
00:43:53

[got most of the stuff from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m56s)
00:43:56

[validation set which is what's our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m57s)
00:43:57

[independent variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h43m59s)
00:43:59

[how dependent variables and then we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m01s)
00:44:01

[to tell it which things do we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m03s)
00:44:03

[traded as categorical right because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[remember by this time everything's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m08s)
00:44:08

[number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m13s)
00:44:13

[right so it could do the whole things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m15s)
00:44:15

[it's continuous it would just be totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m17s)
00:44:17

[meaningless right so we need to tell it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m19s)
00:44:19

[which things do we want to treat as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m22s)
00:44:22

[categories and so here we just pass in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m24s)
00:44:24

[that list of names that we used before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m26s)
00:44:26

[okay and then a bunch of the parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m30s)
00:44:30

[are the same as the ones you're used to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m33s)
00:44:33

[for example you can set the batch size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m35s)
00:44:35

[yeah so after we do that we've got a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m37s)
00:44:37

[little standard model data object but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m43s)
00:44:43

[there's a trained DL attribute there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m46s)
00:44:46

[Val DL attribute a trained es attribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m49s)
00:44:49

[of LDS attribute it's got a length it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m52s)
00:44:52

[got all the stuff exactly like it did in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[all of our image based data objects okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[so now we need to create the the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m04s)
00:45:04

[or create the learner and so to skip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m06s)
00:45:06

[ahead a little bit we're basically going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m09s)
00:45:09

[to pass in something that looks pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m12s)
00:45:12

[familiar we're going to be passing thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m14s)
00:45:14

[from our model from our model data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m16s)
00:45:16

[create a learner that is suitable for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m18s)
00:45:18

[and will basically be passing in a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m21s)
00:45:21

[other bits of information which will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m24s)
00:45:24

[include how much dropout to use at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m26s)
00:45:26

[very start how many how many activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m29s)
00:45:29

[to have in each layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m33s)
00:45:33

[how much dropout to use at the later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m34s)
00:45:34

[layers but then there's a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m37s)
00:45:37

[extra things that we need to learn about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m40s)
00:45:40

[and specifically it's this thing called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m41s)
00:45:41

[embeddings so this is really the key new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m44s)
00:45:44

[concept we have to learn about all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m50s)
00:45:50

[so all we're doing basically is we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m53s)
00:45:53

[going to take our let's forget about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h45m58s)
00:45:58

[categorical variables for a moment and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m02s)
00:46:02

[just think about the continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m04s)
00:46:04

[variables for our continuous variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m05s)
00:46:05

[all we're going to do is we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m08s)
00:46:08

[grab them all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m11s)
00:46:11

[okay so for our continuous variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m16s)
00:46:16

[we're basically going to say like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m18s)
00:46:18

[here's a big list of all of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m20s)
00:46:20

[continuous variables like the minimum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m23s)
00:46:23

[temperature and the maximum temperature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m25s)
00:46:25

[and the distance to the nearest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m27s)
00:46:27

[competitor and so forth right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m29s)
00:46:29

[here's just a bunch of floating-point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m32s)
00:46:32

[numbers and so basically what the neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m34s)
00:46:34

[that's going to do is going to take that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m36s)
00:46:36

[that 1d array or or vector or to be very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m38s)
00:46:38

[DL like rank one tensor or means the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m44s)
00:46:44

[same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[okay so we're going to take our egg one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m49s)
00:46:49

[tensor and let's put it through a matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m51s)
00:46:51

[multiplication so let's say this has got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m54s)
00:46:54

[like I don't know 20 continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m56s)
00:46:56

[variables and then we can put it through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h46m59s)
00:46:59

[a matrix which must have 20 rows that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m01s)
00:47:01

[how matrix multiplication works and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m05s)
00:47:05

[we can decide how many columns we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m07s)
00:47:07

[right so maybe we decided 100 right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m09s)
00:47:09

[so that matrix model captions going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m12s)
00:47:12

[spit out a new length 100 rank 1 tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m14s)
00:47:14

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m20s)
00:47:20

[that's that's what that's what a linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m21s)
00:47:21

[that's what a matrix product does and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[that's the definition of a linear layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m26s)
00:47:26

[indeed what okay and so then the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m28s)
00:47:28

[thing we do is we can put that through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m32s)
00:47:32

[rail you right which means we throw away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m34s)
00:47:34

[the negatives okay and now we can put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m36s)
00:47:36

[that through another matrix product okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m39s)
00:47:39

[so this is going to have to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m42s)
00:47:42

[hundred rows by definition and we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m43s)
00:47:43

[have as many columns as we like and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m47s)
00:47:47

[let's say maybe this was the last layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m49s)
00:47:49

[so the next thing we're trying to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m51s)
00:47:51

[to predict sales so there's just one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m53s)
00:47:53

[value we're trying to predict for sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m57s)
00:47:57

[so we could put it through a matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h47m59s)
00:47:59

[product that just had one column and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m01s)
00:48:01

[that's going to spit out a single number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m02s)
00:48:02

[all right so that's like that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m05s)
00:48:05

[like a one layer neural net if you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m09s)
00:48:09

[now in practice you know we wouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m14s)
00:48:14

[make it one layer so we would actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m17s)
00:48:17

[have leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m19s)
00:48:19

[you know maybe we'd have 50 here and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m23s)
00:48:23

[then that gives us a 50 long vector and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m26s)
00:48:26

[then maybe we then put that into our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m30s)
00:48:30

[final 50 by one and that's if it's out a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m34s)
00:48:34

[single number and one reason I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m40s)
00:48:40

[have to change that there was to point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m42s)
00:48:42

[out you know rally you would never put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m43s)
00:48:43

[rally you in the last layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m46s)
00:48:46

[I could never want to throw away the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m48s)
00:48:48

[negatives because that the softmax let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m49s)
00:48:49

[go back to the softness the soft max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m54s)
00:48:54

[needs negatives in it because it's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m56s)
00:48:56

[negatives that are the things that allow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h48m59s)
00:48:59

[it to create low probabilities that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m00s)
00:49:00

[minor detail but it's useful to remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m04s)
00:49:04

[okay so basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m06s)
00:49:06

[so basically a simple view of a fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m13s)
00:49:13

[connected euro net is something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m19s)
00:49:19

[takes in as an input a rank one tensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m22s)
00:49:22

[it's bits it's through a linear layer an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m26s)
00:49:26

[activation layer another linear layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m31s)
00:49:31

[softmax and that's the output okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m36s)
00:49:36

[so we could obviously decide to add more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m43s)
00:49:43

[linear layers we could decide maybe to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m46s)
00:49:46

[add dropout all right so these are some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m50s)
00:49:50

[of the decisions that we need we get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[make right but we there's not that much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[we can do right there's not much really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m58s)
00:49:58

[crazy architecture stuff to do so when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h49m59s)
00:49:59

[we come back to image models later in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m02s)
00:50:02

[the course we're going to learn about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m06s)
00:50:06

[all the weird things that go on and like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m07s)
00:50:07

[resonates and inception networks and but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m09s)
00:50:09

[in these fully connected networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m12s)
00:50:12

[they're really pretty simple they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m14s)
00:50:14

[just in dispersed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m15s)
00:50:15

[linear layers that is matrix products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m17s)
00:50:17

[and activation functions like value and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m19s)
00:50:19

[a soft mix at the edge and if it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m23s)
00:50:23

[classification which actually ours is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m27s)
00:50:27

[not classification in this case we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m29s)
00:50:29

[trying to predict sales there isn't even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[a soft mix right we don't want it to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m33s)
00:50:33

[between 0 and 1 ok so we can just throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m35s)
00:50:35

[away the last activation altogether if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m39s)
00:50:39

[we have time we can talk about a slight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m43s)
00:50:43

[trick we can do there but for now we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m45s)
00:50:45

[think of it that way so that was all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[assuming that everything was continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m51s)
00:50:51

[right but what about categorical right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m53s)
00:50:53

[so we've got like day of week right and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h50m56s)
00:50:56

[we're going to treat it as categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m04s)
00:51:04

[practice like Saturday Sunday Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m06s)
00:51:06

[that should be 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m11s)
00:51:11

[ready okay how do we feed that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m15s)
00:51:15

[because I want to find a way of getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m19s)
00:51:19

[that in so that we still end up with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m21s)
00:51:21

[wreck one tends to refloat and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m22s)
00:51:22

[trick is this we create a new little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m26s)
00:51:26

[matrix of with seven rows and as many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m28s)
00:51:28

[columns as we choose right so let's pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m35s)
00:51:35

[four all right so here's our seven rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m38s)
00:51:38

[and four columns right and basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m43s)
00:51:43

[what we do is let's add our categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m48s)
00:51:48

[variables to the end so let's say the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m52s)
00:51:52

[first row was Sunday right then what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m53s)
00:51:53

[do is we do a lookup into this matrix we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h51m57s)
00:51:57

[say oh here's sunday we do and look up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m00s)
00:52:00

[into here and we grab this row and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m02s)
00:52:02

[this matrix we basically fill with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m06s)
00:52:06

[floating-point numbers so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m08s)
00:52:08

[end up grabbing little subset of for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m10s)
00:52:10

[floating-point numbers at Sunday's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m15s)
00:52:15

[particular for floating-point numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m18s)
00:52:18

[and so that way we convert Sunday into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m20s)
00:52:20

[rank 1 tensor of for floating-point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m26s)
00:52:26

[numbers and initially those four numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m29s)
00:52:29

[are random all right and in fact this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m31s)
00:52:31

[whole thing we initially start out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m34s)
00:52:34

[random okay but then we're going to put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m37s)
00:52:37

[that through our neural net right so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m41s)
00:52:41

[basically then take those four numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m44s)
00:52:44

[and we remove sunday instead we add our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m46s)
00:52:46

[four numbers on here right so we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m50s)
00:52:50

[turned our categorical thing into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m52s)
00:52:52

[floating-point vector and so now we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m54s)
00:52:54

[just put that throughout neural net just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h52m58s)
00:52:58

[like before and at the very end we found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m01s)
00:53:01

[out the loss and then we can figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m03s)
00:53:03

[which direction is down and do gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m05s)
00:53:05

[descent in that direction and eventually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m09s)
00:53:09

[that will find its way back to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[little list of four numbers and it'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m13s)
00:53:13

[say okay those random numbers weren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m16s)
00:53:16

[very good this one needs to go up a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m18s)
00:53:18

[that one is to go up a bit that one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m20s)
00:53:20

[to go down a bit that one is to go up a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m21s)
00:53:21

[bit and so will actually update our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[original those four numbers in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m26s)
00:53:26

[match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m28s)
00:53:28

[and we'll do this again and again and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m29s)
00:53:29

[again and so this this matrix will stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m31s)
00:53:31

[looking random and it will start looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m34s)
00:53:34

[more and more like like the exact four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m36s)
00:53:36

[numbers that happen to work best for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m38s)
00:53:38

[Sunday the exact four numbers that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m40s)
00:53:40

[happen to work best for Friday and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m42s)
00:53:42

[forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m44s)
00:53:44

[and so in other words this matrix is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m45s)
00:53:45

[just another bunch of weights in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m48s)
00:53:48

[neural net all right and so matrices of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m52s)
00:53:52

[this type are called embedding matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h53m56s)
00:53:56

[so an embedding matrix is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m03s)
00:54:03

[where we start out with an integer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m06s)
00:54:06

[between zero and the maximum number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m10s)
00:54:10

[levels of that category we literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m13s)
00:54:13

[index into a matrix to find a particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m17s)
00:54:17

[row so if it was the level was one we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m20s)
00:54:20

[take the first row we grab that road and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m23s)
00:54:23

[we append it to all of our continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m27s)
00:54:27

[variables and so we now have a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m30s)
00:54:30

[vector of continuous variables and when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m34s)
00:54:34

[we can do the same thing so let's say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m37s)
00:54:37

[zip code right so we could like have an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m39s)
00:54:39

[embedding matrix let's say there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m41s)
00:54:41

[5,000 zip codes it would be 5,000 rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m44s)
00:54:44

[long as wide as we decide maybe it's 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m46s)
00:54:46

[wide and so we'd say ok here's 9 4 0 0 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m49s)
00:54:49

[that zip code is index number 4 you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m55s)
00:54:55

[matrix ordered out and we'd find the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m58s)
00:54:58

[fourth row regret those 50 numbers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h54m59s)
00:54:59

[append those on to our big vector and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m02s)
00:55:02

[then everything after that is just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m05s)
00:55:05

[same we just put it through our linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m07s)

[question and we'll learn more about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m16s)
00:55:16

[when we look at collaborative filtering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m19s)
00:55:19

[but now they represent no more or no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m20s)
00:55:20

[less than any other parameter in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m24s)
00:55:24

[neural net you know they're just they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m26s)
00:55:26

[just parameters that we're learning that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m30s)
00:55:30

[happen to end up giving us a good loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m32s)
00:55:32

[we will discover later that these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m35s)
00:55:35

[particular parameters often however are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m37s)
00:55:37

[human interpretive all and quote can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m39s)
00:55:39

[quite interesting but that's a side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m41s)
00:55:41

[effect of them it's not fundamental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m44s)
00:55:44

[they're just for random numbers for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m47s)
00:55:47

[that we're that we're learning or sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[of four random numbers to have a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m52s)
00:55:52

[heuristic for at the dimensionality of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m57s)
00:55:57

[embedding matrix so why four here I sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h55m59s)
00:55:59

[do so what I first of all did was I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m03s)
00:56:03

[a little list of every categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m12s)
00:56:12

[variable and its cardinality okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m15s)
00:56:15

[they're they allow so there's a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m19s)
00:56:19

[and there's a thousand plus different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m20s)
00:56:20

[stores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m22s)
00:56:22

[apparently in Rothman's Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m24s)
00:56:24

[there are eight days of the week that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m27s)
00:56:27

[because there are seven days of the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m29s)
00:56:29

[plus one left over for unknown even if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m30s)
00:56:30

[there were no missing values in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m33s)
00:56:33

[original data I always still set aside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m35s)
00:56:35

[one just in case there's a missing or an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m37s)
00:56:37

[unknown or something different in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m39s)
00:56:39

[test set again for years but there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m41s)
00:56:41

[actually three plus room for an unknown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m44s)
00:56:44

[and so forth right so what I do my rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m46s)
00:56:46

[of thumb is this take the cardinality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m51s)
00:56:51

[with the variable divide it by two but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h56m55s)
00:56:55

[don't make it bigger than 50 okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m00s)
00:57:00

[these are my embedding matrices so my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m04s)
00:57:04

[store matrix so there has to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m06s)
00:57:06

[thousand one hundred and sixteen rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m10s)
00:57:10

[cuz I need to look up right to find his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m12s)
00:57:12

[store number three and then it's been a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m15s)
00:57:15

[return back a rank one tensor of length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m17s)
00:57:17

[fifty day of week it's going to look up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m20s)
00:57:20

[into which one of the eight and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m23s)
00:57:23

[returning the thing of length four so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m25s)
00:57:25

[what you typically build on embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m31s)
00:57:31

[metrics for each categorical feature yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m33s)
00:57:33

[yeah so that's what I've done here so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m36s)
00:57:36

[I've said for see in categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m38s)
00:57:38

[variables see how many categories there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m43s)
00:57:43

[are and then for each of those things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m47s)
00:57:47

[create one of these and then this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m53s)
00:57:53

[called embedding sizes and then you may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m56s)
00:57:56

[have noticed that that's actually the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h57m59s)
00:57:59

[first thing that we pass to get learner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m01s)
00:58:01

[and so that tells it for every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m03s)
00:58:03

[categorical variable that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m05s)
00:58:05

[embedding matrix to use for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m07s)
00:58:07

[variable that is behind you listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m08s)
00:58:08

[yes traffic aggression so besides our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m11s)
00:58:11

[random initialization and there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m16s)
00:58:16

[other ways to actually initialize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m19s)
00:58:19

[embedding yes or no there's two ways one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m20s)
00:58:20

[is random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m25s)
00:58:25

[the other is pre-trained and we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m26s)
00:58:26

[probably talk about pre-trained more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m29s)
00:58:29

[later in the course but the basic idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m31s)
00:58:31

[though is if somebody else at Rossmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m33s)
00:58:33

[had already trained a neural net just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m35s)
00:58:35

[like you you would use a pre trained net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m37s)
00:58:37

[from imagenet to look at pictures of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m39s)
00:58:39

[cats and dogs if somebody else is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m41s)
00:58:41

[pre-trained a network to predict cheese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m43s)
00:58:43

[sales in ruspin you may as well start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m45s)
00:58:45

[with their embedding matrix of stores to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m48s)
00:58:48

[predict liquor sales in Rossmann and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m50s)
00:58:50

[this is what happens for example at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m53s)
00:58:53

[Pinterest and Institute they both use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m56s)
00:58:56

[this technique instacart uses it for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h58m59s)
00:58:59

[routing their shoppers Pinterest uses it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m02s)
00:59:02

[for deciding what to display on a web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m04s)
00:59:04

[page when you go there and they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m06s)
00:59:06

[embedding matrices of products in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[instigates case of stores that get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m12s)
00:59:12

[shared in the organization so people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m15s)
00:59:15

[don't have to train you once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m18s)
00:59:18

[so for the embedding sighs why wouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m23s)
00:59:23

[you just use like open hot scheme and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[just well what is the advantage of doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m31s)
00:59:31

[this they're supposed to just do it well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m33s)
00:59:33

[good question so so we could easily as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m36s)
00:59:36

[you point out have instead of passing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m39s)
00:59:39

[these four numbers record instead of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m43s)
00:59:43

[passed in seven numbers all zeroes but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m46s)
00:59:46

[one of them is one and that also is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m50s)
00:59:50

[list of floats and that would totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m52s)
00:59:52

[work and that's how generally speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=00h59m55s)
00:59:55

[categorical variables have been used in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m00s)
01:00:00

[statistics for many years it's called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m03s)
01:00:03

[dummy variables the problem is that in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m05s)
01:00:05

[that case the concept of sundae could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m09s)
01:00:09

[only ever be associated with a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m13s)
01:00:13

[floating-point number right and so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m15s)
01:00:15

[basically gets this kind of linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m19s)
01:00:19

[behavior it says like sunday is more or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m21s)
01:00:21

[less of a single thing yeah worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m24s)
01:00:24

[noticing directions it's saying like now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m27s)
01:00:27

[sunday is a concept in four dimensional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m29s)
01:00:29

[space right and so what we tend to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m31s)
01:00:31

[happen is that these embedding vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m34s)
01:00:34

[tend to get these kind of rich semantic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m38s)
01:00:38

[concepts so for example if it turns out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m42s)
01:00:42

[that weekends kind of have a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m45s)
01:00:45

[behavior you'll tend to see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m50s)
01:00:50

[Saturday and Sunday will have like some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m52s)
01:00:52

[particular number higher or more likely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m54s)
01:00:54

[it turns out that certain days of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m57s)
01:00:57

[week are associated with higher sales of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h00m59s)
01:00:59

[certain kinds of goods that you kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m06s)
01:01:06

[can't go without I don't know like gas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m09s)
01:01:09

[or milk see where else there might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m11s)
01:01:11

[other products like like wine for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m14s)
01:01:14

[example like wine that tend to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m18s)
01:01:18

[associated with like the days before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m23s)
01:01:23

[weekends or holidays right so there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m26s)
01:01:26

[might be kind of a column which is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m28s)
01:01:28

[to what extent is this day of the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m31s)
01:01:31

[kind of associated with people going out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m35s)
01:01:35

[you know so basically yeah by by having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m37s)
01:01:37

[this higher dimensionality dektor rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m41s)
01:01:41

[than just a single number it gives the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m44s)

[deep Learning Network a chance to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m46s)
01:01:46

[these rich representations and so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m49s)
01:01:49

[idea of an embedding is actually what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m53s)
01:01:53

[called a distributed representation it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m56s)
01:01:56

[kind of the fun most fundamental concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h01m58s)
01:01:58

[of neural networks this is the idea that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m01s)
01:02:01

[a concept in a neural network has a kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m03s)
01:02:03

[of a a high dimensional representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m06s)
01:02:06

[and often it can be hard to interpret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m10s)
01:02:10

[because the idea is like each of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m12s)
01:02:12

[numbers in this vector doesn't even have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m14s)
01:02:14

[to have just one meaning you know it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m17s)
01:02:17

[could mean one thing if this is low and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m19s)
01:02:19

[that one's high and something else if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m21s)
01:02:21

[that one's high and that one's low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m22s)
01:02:22

[because it's going through this kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m23s)
01:02:23

[rich nonlinear function right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m25s)
01:02:25

[it's this it's this rich representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m29s)

[that allows it to learn such such such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m33s)
01:02:33

[interesting relationships I'm kind of oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m36s)
01:02:36

[another question sure I'll speak louder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m41s)
01:02:41

[so are there he's in a meeting so I get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m44s)
01:02:44

[the the fundamental of be like the word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m50s)
01:02:50

[vector were to Vic vector algebra even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m52s)
01:02:52

[run on this thing are the embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m55s)
01:02:55

[suited suitable for certain types of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[variables like or are these only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m00s)
01:03:00

[suitable for there are different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m02s)
01:03:02

[categories that that the embeddings are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m05s)
01:03:05

[suitable for an embedding is suitable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m07s)
01:03:07

[for any categorical variable okay so so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[the only thing it it can't really work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m13s)
01:03:13

[well at all four would be something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m16s)
01:03:16

[is too high cardinality so I'm like in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m18s)
01:03:18

[other words we had like whatever it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[six hundred thousand rows if you had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m22s)
01:03:22

[variable with six hundred thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m24s)
01:03:24

[levels that's just not a useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m26s)
01:03:26

[categorical variable you could packetize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m29s)
01:03:29

[it I guess but yeah in general like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m33s)
01:03:33

[can see here that the the third place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m36s)
01:03:36

[getters in this competition really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m38s)
01:03:38

[decided that everything that was not too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m41s)
01:03:41

[high cardinality they put them all as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m45s)
01:03:45

[categorical very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[and I think that's a good rule of thumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m47s)
01:03:47

[you know if you can make a categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m49s)
01:03:49

[variable you may as well because that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m51s)
01:03:51

[way it can learn this rich distributed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m54s)
01:03:54

[representation where else if you leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m56s)
01:03:56

[it as continuous you know the most it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h03m58s)
01:03:58

[can do is to kind of try and find a know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m00s)
01:04:00

[a single functional form that fits it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m03s)
01:04:03

[well after question so you were saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m05s)
01:04:05

[that you are kind of increasing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m10s)
01:04:10

[dimension but actually in most cases we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m12s)
01:04:12

[will use a one holding column which has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m15s)
01:04:15

[even a bigger dimension that so in a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m18s)
01:04:18

[you are also reducing but in the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m22s)
01:04:22

[reach I think that's very good yeah it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m24s)
01:04:24

[like yes you know you can figure this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m27s)
01:04:27

[one hot encoding which actually is high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[dimensional but it's not meaningfully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m33s)
01:04:33

[high dimensional because everything set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m36s)
01:04:36

[one is easy right I'm saying that also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m37s)
01:04:37

[because even this will reduce the amount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m39s)
01:04:39

[of memory and things like this that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m41s)
01:04:41

[have to write you're absolutely right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m43s)
01:04:43

[and and so we may as well go ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m46s)
01:04:46

[actually destroyed like what's going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m49s)
01:04:49

[with the matrix algebra behind the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m51s)
01:04:51

[scenes see this if this doesn't quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m52s)
01:04:52

[make sense you can kind of skip over it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m54s)
01:04:54

[but for some people I know this really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m56s)
01:04:56

[helps if we started out with something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h04m58s)
01:04:58

[saying this is Sunday right we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m01s)
01:05:01

[represent this as a one hot encoded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m06s)
01:05:06

[vector right and so Sunday you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m08s)
01:05:08

[maybe was position here so that would be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m12s)
01:05:12

[a 1 and then the rest of zeros okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m15s)
01:05:15

[then we've got our embedding matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m19s)
01:05:19

[right with eight rows and in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m23s)
01:05:23

[four columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m27s)
01:05:27

[one way to think of this actually is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m32s)
01:05:32

[matrix product right so I said you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m35s)
01:05:35

[think of this as like looking up the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m38s)
01:05:38

[number one you know and finding like its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m40s)
01:05:40

[index in the array but if you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m43s)
01:05:43

[about it that's actually identical to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m46s)
01:05:46

[doing a matrix product between a one-pot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m49s)
01:05:49

[encoded vector and the embedding matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[like you're going to go zero times this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m54s)
01:05:54

[row one times this row zero times this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h05m58s)
01:05:58

[row and so it's like a one hot embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m01s)
01:06:01

[matrix product is identical to during](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m04s)
01:06:04

[the lookup and so some people in the bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m08s)
01:06:08

[old days actually implemented embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m13s)
01:06:13

[matrices by doing a one hot encoding and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m15s)
01:06:15

[then a matrix product and in fact a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m18s)
01:06:18

[of like machine learning methods still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m21s)
01:06:21

[kind of do that but as you know that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m23s)
01:06:23

[kind of alluding to it's that's terribly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m27s)
01:06:27

[inefficient so all of the modern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m29s)
01:06:29

[libraries implement this as taking take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m31s)
01:06:31

[an integer and do a lookup into an array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m34s)
01:06:34

[but the nice thing about realizing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m37s)
01:06:37

[is actually a matrix product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m39s)
01:06:39

[mathematically is it makes it more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m40s)
01:06:40

[obvious how the gradients are going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m42s)
01:06:42

[flow so when we do stochastic gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m45s)
01:06:45

[descent it's we can think of it as just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[another linear layer okay does it say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m49s)
01:06:49

[that's like somewhat minor detail but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m52s)
01:06:52

[hopefully for some of you it helps could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m55s)
01:06:55

[you touch on using dates and times this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h06m59s)
01:06:59

[category course and how that affects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m02s)
01:07:02

[seasonality yeah absolutely that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m03s)
01:07:03

[great question did I cover dates it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m06s)
01:07:06

[remember no okay so I cover dates in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[lot of detail in the machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m15s)
01:07:15

[course but it's worth briefly mentioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m16s)
01:07:16

[here there's a fast AI function called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m18s)
01:07:18

[add date part which takes a data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m26s)
01:07:26

[and column in that column name needs to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m29s)
01:07:29

[be a date it removes unless you squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m33s)
01:07:33

[drop equals false it optionally removes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m36s)
01:07:36

[the column from the data frame and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m39s)
01:07:39

[replaces it with lots of column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[representing all of the useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m43s)
01:07:43

[information about that date like day of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m45s)
01:07:45

[week day of month month of year year is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m48s)
01:07:48

[at the start of the quarter is at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m51s)
01:07:51

[end of the quarter basically everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m52s)
01:07:52

[that pandas gives us and so that way we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m54s)
01:07:54

[end up when we look at our list of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[features where you can see them here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m03s)
01:08:03

[right yeah month week data etc so these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m04s)
01:08:04

[all get created for us by a date pad so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m08s)
01:08:08

[we end up with you know this eight long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m13s)
01:08:13

[embedding matrix so I guess eight rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m19s)
01:08:19

[by four column embedding matrix for day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m23s)
01:08:23

[of week and conceptually that allows us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[or allows our model to create some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m29s)
01:08:29

[pretty interesting time series models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m32s)
01:08:32

[all right like it can if there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m34s)
01:08:34

[something that has a seven day period](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m36s)
01:08:36

[cycle that kind of goes up on Mondays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m40s)
01:08:40

[and down on Wednesdays but only for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m43s)
01:08:43

[dairy and only in Berlin it can totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m45s)
01:08:45

[do that but it has all the information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m48s)
01:08:48

[it needs to do that so this turns out to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m50s)
01:08:50

[be a really fantastic way to deal with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m54s)
01:08:54

[time series so I'm really glad you asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m57s)
01:08:57

[the question you just need to make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h08m59s)
01:08:59

[that that the the cycle indicator in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m01s)
01:09:01

[your time series exists as a column so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m05s)
01:09:05

[if you didn't have a column there called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m08s)
01:09:08

[day of week it would be very very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m10s)
01:09:10

[difficult for the neural network to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m12s)
01:09:12

[somehow learn to do like a divide mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m15s)
01:09:15

[seven and then somehow look that up in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[an omitting matrix like it not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m20s)
01:09:20

[impossible but really hard it would use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m22s)
01:09:22

[lots of computation wouldn't do it very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m25s)
01:09:25

[well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m26s)
01:09:26

[so an example of the kind of thing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m27s)
01:09:27

[you need to think about might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m29s)
01:09:29

[holidays for example you know or if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m33s)
01:09:33

[are doing something in you know sales of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m36s)
01:09:36

[beverages in San Francisco you probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m39s)
01:09:39

[want a list of like when weather that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m42s)
01:09:42

[when is the ball game on at AT&amp;T Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m44s)
01:09:44

[because that's going to impact how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m47s)
01:09:47

[people that are drinking beer in Soma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m49s)
01:09:49

[right so you need to make sure that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m51s)
01:09:51

[kind of the basic indicators or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m54s)
01:09:54

[or periodicity x' or whatever there and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m57s)
01:09:57

[your data and as long as they are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h09m59s)
01:09:59

[neuron it's going to learn to use them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m01s)
01:10:01

[so I'm kind of trying to skip over some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m03s)
01:10:03

[of the non deep learning parts alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m06s)
01:10:06

[so the key thing here is that we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[our model data that came from the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m15s)
01:10:15

[frame we tell it how big to make the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m17s)
01:10:17

[embedding matrices we also have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m19s)
01:10:19

[tailor of the columns in that data frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m23s)
01:10:23

[how many of those categorical variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m26s)
01:10:26

[or how many of them are continuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m30s)
01:10:30

[variables so the actual parameter is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m32s)
01:10:32

[number of continuous variables so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m34s)
01:10:34

[can here you can see we just pass in how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m37s)
01:10:37

[many columns are there - how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m39s)
01:10:39

[categorical variables are there so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m41s)
01:10:41

[that way the the neural net knows how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m43s)
01:10:43

[create something that puts the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m47s)
01:10:47

[continuous variables over here and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m49s)
01:10:49

[categorical variables over there the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m51s)
01:10:51

[embedding matrix has its own drop out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m55s)
01:10:55

[alright so this is the dropout to apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h10m57s)
01:10:57

[to the embedding matrix this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m00s)
01:11:00

[number of activations in the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m02s)
01:11:02

[linear player the number of activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m04s)
01:11:04

[in the second linear layer the dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m06s)
01:11:06

[in the first linear player the drop out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m08s)
01:11:08

[for the second linear layer this bit we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m10s)
01:11:10

[won't worry about for now and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m12s)
01:11:12

[finally is how many outputs do we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[to create okay so this is the output of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m16s)
01:11:16

[the last mini layer and obviously it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[one because we want to predict a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m20s)
01:11:20

[number which is sales okay so after that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m22s)
01:11:22

[we now have a learner where we can call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m28s)
01:11:28

[LR find and we get the standard looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m30s)
01:11:30

[shape and we can say what amount do we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m32s)
01:11:32

[want to use and we can then go ahead and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m35s)
01:11:35

[start training using exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m39s)
01:11:39

[API we've seen before so this is all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m41s)
01:11:41

[identical you can pass in I'm not sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m45s)
01:11:45

[if you've seen this before custom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m49s)
01:11:49

[metrics what this does is it just says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m51s)
01:11:51

[please print out a number at the end of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m54s)
01:11:54

[every epoch by calling this function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m56s)
01:11:56

[this is a function we defined a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h11m58s)
01:11:58

[bit earlier which was the root means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m01s)
01:12:01

[bread percentage error first of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m03s)
01:12:03

[going either the power of our sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m05s)
01:12:05

[because our sales were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m08s)
01:12:08

[originally logged so this doesn't change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m10s)
01:12:10

[the training at all it just it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m12s)
01:12:12

[something to print out so we trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m15s)
01:12:15

[that for a while and you know we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m18s)
01:12:18

[some benefits that the original people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m22s)
01:12:22

[that built this don't have specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m25s)
01:12:25

[we've got things like cyclic all muscle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m28s)
01:12:28

[learning rate stochastic gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m31s)
01:12:31

[descent with restarts and so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m33s)
01:12:33

[actually interesting to have a look and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m35s)
01:12:35

[compare although our validation set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m37s)
01:12:37

[isn't identical to the test set it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m42s)
01:12:42

[very similar it's a two-week period that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m45s)
01:12:45

[is at the end of the training data and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m47s)
01:12:47

[so our numbers should be similar and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m49s)
01:12:49

[we look at what we get point oh nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m52s)
01:12:52

[seven and compare that to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m54s)
01:12:54

[leaderboard public leaderboard you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h12m58s)
01:12:58

[see we're kind of sort of look in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m06s)
01:13:06

[top actually that's interesting there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m12s)
01:13:12

[a big difference between the public and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m16s)
01:13:16

[private leaderboard it would have it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m18s)
01:13:18

[would have been right at the top of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m20s)
01:13:20

[private leaderboard but only in the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m21s)
01:13:21

[thirty or forty on the public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m24s)
01:13:24

[leaderboards so not quite sure but you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m25s)
01:13:25

[can see like we're certainly in the top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m27s)
01:13:27

[end of this competition I actually tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m30s)
01:13:30

[running the third place to get his code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m35s)
01:13:35

[and their final result was over a point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m37s)
01:13:37

[one so I actually think that we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m41s)
01:13:41

[trippy compared to private leaderboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m44s)
01:13:44

[but I'm not sure so anyway so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m46s)
01:13:46

[see they're basically there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m50s)
01:13:50

[technique for dealing with time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m51s)
01:13:51

[and structured data and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m55s)
01:13:55

[interestingly the group that that used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h13m58s)
01:13:58

[this technique they actually wrote a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m01s)
01:14:01

[paper about it that's linked in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[notebook when you compare it to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m04s)
01:14:04

[folks that won this competition and came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m08s)
01:14:08

[second they did the other folks did way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m11s)
01:14:11

[more feature engineering like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m13s)
01:14:13

[winners of this competition were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m16s)
01:14:16

[actually subject matter experts in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m18s)
01:14:18

[logistics sales forecasting and so they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m20s)
01:14:20

[had their own code to create lots and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m23s)
01:14:23

[lots of features and talking to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m25s)
01:14:25

[folks at Pinterest who built their very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m28s)
01:14:28

[similar model for recommendations for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m31s)
01:14:31

[Pinterest they say the same thing which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m33s)
01:14:33

[is that when they switched from gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m35s)
01:14:35

[boosting machines to deep learning they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m36s)
01:14:36

[did like way way way less feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m39s)
01:14:39

[engineering it was a much much simpler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m43s)
01:14:43

[model and requires much less maintenance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m45s)
01:14:45

[and so this is like one of the big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m47s)
01:14:47

[benefits of using this approach to deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m50s)
01:14:50

[learning you can get state of the at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m51s)
01:14:51

[results but with a lot less work yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h14m53s)
01:14:53

[are you using any time series in any of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m01s)
01:15:01

[these fits indirectly absolutely using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m05s)
01:15:05

[what we just saw we have a day of week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m11s)
01:15:11

[month of year all that stuff our columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m13s)
01:15:13

[and most of them are being treated as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m16s)
01:15:16

[categories so we're building a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m18s)
01:15:18

[distributed representation of January](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m21s)
01:15:21

[we're building a distributed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m23s)
01:15:23

[representation of Sunday we're building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m24s)
01:15:24

[a distributed representation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m26s)
01:15:26

[Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m27s)
01:15:27

[so we're not using any plastic time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m28s)
01:15:28

[series techniques all we're doing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m33s)
01:15:33

[true fully connected layers in a neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m36s)
01:15:36

[net better metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m39s)
01:15:39

[that's what exactly exactly yeah so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m42s)
01:15:42

[embedding matrix is able to deal with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m45s)
01:15:45

[this stuff like day of week periodicity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m47s)
01:15:47

[and so forth in a way richer way than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m50s)
01:15:50

[any standard time series technique I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m54s)
01:15:54

[ever come across](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m58s)
01:15:58

[one last question the matrix in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h15m58s)
01:15:58

[earlier models we did CNN did not pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m03s)
01:16:03

[it during the fig we passed it when the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m06s)
01:16:06

[data was when we got the data so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m10s)
01:16:10

[not passing anything to fit just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m14s)
01:16:14

[learning rate and the number of cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m17s)
01:16:17

[in this case we're passing in metrics is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m18s)
01:16:18

[not a printout some extra stuff there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m21s)
01:16:21

[a difference in the we're calling data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m24s)
01:16:24

[get learner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m27s)
01:16:27

[so with the imaging approach we just go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m28s)
01:16:28

[learner dot trained and pass at the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m35s)
01:16:35

[but in for these kinds of models in fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m38s)
01:16:38

[for a lot of the models the model that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m43s)
01:16:43

[we build depends on the data in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m46s)
01:16:46

[case we actually need to know like what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m49s)
01:16:49

[embedding matrices do we have and stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m51s)
01:16:51

[like that so in this case it's actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m54s)
01:16:54

[the data object that creates the learner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[so yeah it is it is a bit upside down to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h16m59s)
01:16:59

[what we've seen before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m01s)
01:17:01

[yeah so just to summarize or maybe I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m04s)
01:17:04

[confused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m09s)
01:17:09

[so in this case what we are doing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m10s)
01:17:10

[that we have some kind of structured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m14s)
01:17:14

[data did feature engineering we got some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m16s)
01:17:16

[columnar database or something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m20s)
01:17:20

[embedding matrix for the categorical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m32s)
01:17:32

[variables so the continuous we just put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m35s)
01:17:35

[them straight feature engineering yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m38s)
01:17:38

[then to map it to deep learning I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m46s)
01:17:46

[have to figure out which one I can great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m49s)
01:17:49

[question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[so yes exactly if you want to use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[on your own data set step one is list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h17m57s)
01:17:57

[the categorical variable names list the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m01s)
01:18:01

[continuous variable names put it in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m04s)
01:18:04

[data frame pandas dataframe step two is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m07s)
01:18:07

[to create a list of which row indexes do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m11s)
01:18:11

[you want in your validation set step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m17s)
01:18:17

[three is to call this line of code using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m20s)
01:18:20

[this except like these exact you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m25s)
01:18:25

[just copy and paste it step four is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m27s)
01:18:27

[create your list of how big you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m31s)
01:18:31

[each embedding matrix to be and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m33s)
01:18:33

[step 5 is to call get loner you can use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m37s)
01:18:37

[these exact parameters to start with and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m41s)
01:18:41

[if it over fits or under fits you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m44s)
01:18:44

[fiddle with them and then the final step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m46s)
01:18:46

[is to call fit so yeah almost all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m48s)
01:18:48

[this code will be nearly identical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m53s)
01:18:53

[have a couple of questions one is how is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h18m59s)
01:18:59

[data element ation can be used in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m04s)
01:19:04

[case and the second one is why whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m07s)
01:19:07

[dropouts doing in here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m12s)
01:19:12

[okay so data augmentation I have no idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m14s)
01:19:14

[I mean that's a really interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m16s)
01:19:16

[question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m17s)
01:19:17

[I think it's gotta be domain-specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m21s)
01:19:21

[I've never seen any paper or anybody in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m22s)
01:19:22

[industry doing data augmentation with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m25s)
01:19:25

[structured data and deep blow so I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m27s)
01:19:27

[think it can be done I just haven't seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m29s)
01:19:29

[it done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m31s)
01:19:31

[what is dropout doing exactly the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m32s)
01:19:32

[as before so at each point we have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m36s)
01:19:36

[output of each of these linear layers is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m45s)
01:19:45

[just a rank one tensor and so dropout is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m48s)
01:19:48

[going to go ahead and say let's throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m52s)
01:19:52

[away half of the activations and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m54s)
01:19:54

[very first dropout imbedding drop out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h19m58s)
01:19:58

[literally goes through the embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[matrix and says let's throw away half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m01s)
01:20:01

[the activations that's it okay let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m07s)
01:20:07

[take a break and let's come back at five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m12s)
01:20:12

[past eight okay thanks everybody so now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m16s)
01:20:16

[we're gonna move into something equally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m30s)
01:20:30

[exciting actually before I do I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m34s)
01:20:34

[been sure that I had a good question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m36s)
01:20:36

[during the break which was what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m38s)
01:20:38

[downside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m41s)
01:20:41

[like like almost no one's using this why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m42s)
01:20:42

[not and and basically I think the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m49s)
01:20:49

[is like as we discussed before no one in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m53s)
01:20:53

[academia almost is working on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m55s)
01:20:55

[because it's not something that people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m57s)
01:20:57

[really publish on and as a result there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h20m59s)
01:20:59

[haven't been really great examples where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m04s)
01:21:04

[people could look at and say oh here's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m06s)
01:21:06

[technique that works well so let's have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m07s)
01:21:07

[our company implement it but perhaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m10s)
01:21:10

[equally importantly until now with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m12s)
01:21:12

[fast AI library there hasn't been any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m16s)
01:21:16

[way to do it conveniently if you wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m18s)
01:21:18

[to implement one of these models you had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m23s)
01:21:23

[to write all the custom code yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m25s)
01:21:25

[where else now as we discussed it's you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m28s)
01:21:28

[know sick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m30s)
01:21:30

[it's basically a six step process you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m33s)
01:21:33

[know involving about you know not much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m36s)
01:21:36

[more than six lines of code so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m39s)
01:21:39

[reason I mentioned this is to say like I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m43s)
01:21:43

[think there are a lot of big commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m44s)
01:21:44

[and scientific opportunities to use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m47s)
01:21:47

[to solve problems that previously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m51s)
01:21:51

[haven't been solved very well before so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m53s)
01:21:53

[like I'll be really interested to hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m57s)
01:21:57

[if some of you try this out you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h21m59s)
01:21:59

[maybe on like old cattle competitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m02s)
01:22:02

[you might find like oh I would have won](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m06s)
01:22:06

[this if I'd use this technique that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m08s)
01:22:08

[would be interesting or if you've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m09s)
01:22:09

[some data set you work with at work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m11s)
01:22:11

[without some kind of model that you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m13s)
01:22:13

[been doing to the GBM or a random forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m15s)
01:22:15

[does this help you know the thing I I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m17s)
01:22:17

[still somewhat new to this I've been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m22s)
01:22:22

[doing this for basically since the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m25s)
01:22:25

[of the year was when I started working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m28s)
01:22:28

[on these structured deep learning models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m29s)
01:22:29

[so I haven't had enough opportunity to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m31s)
01:22:31

[know where might it fail it's worked for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m34s)
01:22:34

[nearly everything I've tried it with so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m37s)
01:22:37

[far but yeah I think this class is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m39s)
01:22:39

[first time that there's going to be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m43s)
01:22:43

[more than half a dozen people fulfilled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m46s)
01:22:46

[who actually are working on this so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m48s)
01:22:48

[think you know as a group we're gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m50s)
01:22:50

[hopefully learn a lot and build some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m51s)
01:22:51

[interesting things and this would be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m54s)
01:22:54

[great thing if you're thinking of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m55s)
01:22:55

[writing a post about something or here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m56s)
01:22:56

[an area that there's a couple of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h22m59s)
01:22:59

[there's a poster in staccato about what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m02s)
01:23:02

[they did Pinterest has a an O'Reilly a a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m04s)
01:23:04

[video about what they did that's about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m09s)
01:23:09

[it and there's two academic papers both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m11s)
01:23:11

[about Carroll competition victories one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m15s)
01:23:15

[from Yoshi Joshua Ben geo and his group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m17s)
01:23:17

[they won a taxi destination forecasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m21s)
01:23:21

[competition and then also the one linked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m25s)
01:23:25

[for this rossmann competition so yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m28s)
01:23:28

[there's some background on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m33s)
01:23:33

[alright so language natural language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m33s)
01:23:33

[processing is the area which is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m38s)
01:23:38

[like the most up-and-coming area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m44s)
01:23:44

[moaning it's kind of like two or three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m47s)
01:23:47

[years behind computer vision in deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m48s)
01:23:48

[learning it was kind of like the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m52s)
01:23:52

[second area that deep learning started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m54s)
01:23:54

[getting really popular in and you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m57s)
01:23:57

[computer vision got to the point where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h23m59s)
01:23:59

[it was like clear state of the art for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m03s)
01:24:03

[most computer vision things maybe in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m06s)
01:24:06

[like 2014 you know and in some things in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m07s)
01:24:07

[like 2012 in NLP we're still at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m10s)
01:24:10

[point where for a lot of things deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m14s)
01:24:14

[learning is now the state of the art but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m17s)
01:24:17

[not quite everything but as you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m18s)
01:24:18

[the state of kind of the software and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m21s)
01:24:21

[some of the concepts is much less mature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m25s)
01:24:25

[than it is for computer vision so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m28s)
01:24:28

[general none of the stuff we talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m32s)

[about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m33s)
01:24:33

[after computer vision is going to be as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m34s)
01:24:34

[like settled as the computer vision and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m36s)
01:24:36

[stuff was so NLP one of the interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m39s)
01:24:39

[things is in the last few months some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m42s)
01:24:42

[the good ideas from computer vision have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m45s)
01:24:45

[started to spread into NLP for the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m47s)
01:24:47

[time and we've seen some really big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m49s)
01:24:49

[advances so a lot of the stuff you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m51s)
01:24:51

[see in NLP is is pretty new so I'm going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m52s)
01:24:52

[to start with a particular kind of NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h24m57s)
01:24:57

[problem and one of the things refined in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m01s)
01:25:01

[NLP is like there are particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m03s)
01:25:03

[problems you can solve and they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m04s)
01:25:04

[particular names and so there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m06s)
01:25:06

[particular kind of problem in NLP called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m08s)
01:25:08

[language modeling and language modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m10s)
01:25:10

[has a very specific definition that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m13s)
01:25:13

[means build a model we're given a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m15s)
01:25:15

[words of a sentence can you predict what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m19s)
01:25:19

[the next word is going to be so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m21s)
01:25:21

[you're using your mobile phone and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m24s)
01:25:24

[you're typing away and you press space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m26s)
01:25:26

[and then it says like this is what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m28s)
01:25:28

[next word might be like SwiftKey does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m30s)
01:25:30

[this like really well and SwiftKey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m33s)
01:25:33

[actually uses deep learning for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m35s)
01:25:35

[that's that's a language model okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m36s)
01:25:36

[it has a very specific meaning when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m40s)
01:25:40

[say language modeling we mean a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m41s)
01:25:41

[that can predict the next word of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m44s)
01:25:44

[sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m46s)
01:25:46

[so let me give you an example I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m48s)
01:25:48

[downloaded about 18 months worth of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m49s)
01:25:49

[papers from archive so for those of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m54s)
01:25:54

[that don't know what archive is the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h25m57s)
01:25:57

[popular preprint server in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m01s)
01:26:01

[community and various others and has you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m03s)
01:26:03

[know lots of academic papers and so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m07s)
01:26:07

[grabbed the abstracts and the topics for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m10s)
01:26:10

[each and so here's an example so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m14s)
01:26:14

[category of this particular paper what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m16s)
01:26:16

[computer CSMA is computer science and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m18s)
01:26:18

[networking and then the summary let the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m21s)
01:26:21

[abstract of the paper they're seeing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m24s)
01:26:24

[exploitation of mm-wave bands is one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m26s)
01:26:26

[the key enabler for 5g mobile bla bla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m28s)
01:26:28

[bla okay so here's like an example piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m30s)
01:26:30

[of text from my language model so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m35s)
01:26:35

[trained a language model on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m39s)
01:26:39

[archived data set that I downloaded and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m41s)
01:26:41

[then I built a simple little test which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m44s)
01:26:44

[basically you would pass it some like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m46s)
01:26:46

[priming text so you'd say like Oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m50s)
01:26:50

[imagine you started reading a document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m53s)
01:26:53

[that said category is computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m54s)
01:26:54

[networking and the summary is algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h26m57s)
01:26:57

[that and then I said please write an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m00s)
01:27:00

[archive abstract so it said that if it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m04s)
01:27:04

[networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m07s)
01:27:07

[algorithms that use the same network as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m08s)
01:27:08

[a single node I'm not able to achieve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m11s)
01:27:11

[the same performance as a traditional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m13s)
01:27:13

[network based routing algorithms in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m14s)
01:27:14

[paper we propose a novel routing scheme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m16s)
01:27:16

[but okay so it it's learnt by reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m18s)
01:27:18

[archive papers that somebody who is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m22s)
01:27:22

[playing algorithms that where the word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m24s)
01:27:24

[cat CSM ie came before it is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m27s)
01:27:27

[talk like this and remember it started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m31s)
01:27:31

[out not knowing English at all right it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m34s)
01:27:34

[actually started out with an embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m36s)
01:27:36

[matrix for every word in English that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m38s)
01:27:38

[was random okay and by reading lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m41s)
01:27:41

[archive papers it weren't what kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m44s)
01:27:44

[words followed others so then I tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m46s)
01:27:46

[what if we said cat computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m48s)
01:27:48

[computer vision summary algorithms that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m51s)
01:27:51

[use the same data to perform image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m55s)
01:27:55

[specification are increasingly being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h27m58s)
01:27:58

[used to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m00s)
01:28:00

[proves the performance of image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m01s)
01:28:01

[classification algorithms and this paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m02s)
01:28:02

[we propose a novel method for image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m04s)
01:28:04

[specification using a deeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m06s)
01:28:06

[convolutional neural network parentheses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m07s)
01:28:07

[CNN so you can see like it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m09s)
01:28:09

[like almost the same sentence as back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m12s)
01:28:12

[here but things have just changed into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m15s)
01:28:15

[this world of computer vision rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m17s)
01:28:17

[than networking so I tried something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m20s)
01:28:20

[else which is like okay category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m22s)
01:28:22

[computer vision and I created the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m24s)
01:28:24

[world's shortest ever abstract that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m26s)
01:28:26

[words and then I said title on and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m28s)
01:28:28

[title of this is going to be on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m32s)
01:28:32

[performance object learning for image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m35s)
01:28:35

[classification in OS is end of string so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m36s)
01:28:36

[that's like end of title what if it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m39s)
01:28:39

[networking summary algorithms title on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m42s)
01:28:42

[the performance of wireless networks as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m44s)
01:28:44

[opposed to towards computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m47s)
01:28:47

[towards a new approach to image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m50s)
01:28:50

[specification networking towards then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m52s)
01:28:52

[you approach to the analysis of wireless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m55s)
01:28:55

[networks so like I find this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h28m57s)
01:28:57

[mind-blowing right I started out with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m00s)
01:29:00

[some random matrices which had like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m02s)
01:29:02

[literally no no pre-trade anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m06s)
01:29:06

[I fed at 18 months worth of archived](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m09s)
01:29:09

[articles and it learnt not only how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m12s)
01:29:12

[write English pretty well but also after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m15s)
01:29:15

[you say something's a convolutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m19s)
01:29:19

[neural network you should then use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m20s)
01:29:20

[parentheses to say what it's called and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m22s)
01:29:22

[furthermore that the kinds of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m24s)
01:29:24

[people talk could say create algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m27s)
01:29:27

[for in computer vision are performing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m28s)
01:29:28

[image classification and in networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m31s)
01:29:31

[are achieving the same performance as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m33s)
01:29:33

[traditional network based routing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m37s)
01:29:37

[algorithms so like a language model is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m38s)
01:29:38

[can be like incredibly deep and subtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m42s)
01:29:42

[right and so we're going to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m47s)
01:29:47

[build that but actually not because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m49s)
01:29:49

[care about this at all we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m52s)
01:29:52

[build it because we're going to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m55s)
01:29:55

[create a pre-trained model what we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m56s)
01:29:56

[actually going to try and do is take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h29m58s)
01:29:58

[IMDB movie reviews and figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m00s)
01:30:00

[whether they're positive or negative so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m04s)
01:30:04

[if you think about it this is a lot like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m07s)
01:30:07

[cats vs. dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m08s)
01:30:08

[that's a classification algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m09s)
01:30:09

[but rather than an image we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m12s)
01:30:12

[have the text of a review so I'd really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m14s)
01:30:14

[like to use a pre-trained Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m18s)
01:30:18

[like I would at least my connect to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m19s)
01:30:19

[start with a network that knows how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m22s)
01:30:22

[read English right and so my view was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m24s)
01:30:24

[like okay to know how to read English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m29s)
01:30:29

[means you should be able to like predict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m31s)
01:30:31

[the next word of a sentence so what if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m33s)
01:30:33

[we pre train a language model and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m36s)
01:30:36

[use that pre-trained language model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[then just like in computer vision stick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m42s)
01:30:42

[some new layers on the end and ask it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m44s)
01:30:44

[instead of - predicting the next word in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m46s)
01:30:46

[the sentence instead predict whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m48s)
01:30:48

[something is positive or negative so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m51s)
01:30:51

[when I started working on this this was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m54s)
01:30:54

[actually a new idea unfortunately in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m57s)
01:30:57

[last couple of months I've been doing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h30m59s)
01:30:59

[you know a few people have actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m01s)
01:31:01

[couple people started publishing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m02s)
01:31:02

[and so this has moved from being a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m04s)
01:31:04

[totally new idea to being a you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m06s)
01:31:06

[somewhat new idea so so this idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m08s)
01:31:08

[creating a language model making that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m14s)
01:31:14

[the pre-trained model for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m17s)
01:31:17

[classification model is what we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m18s)
01:31:18

[to learn to do now and so the idea is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m21s)
01:31:21

[we're really kind of trying to leverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m23s)
01:31:23

[exactly what we learnt in our computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m25s)
01:31:25

[vision work which is how do we do fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m28s)
01:31:28

[tuning to create powerful classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m30s)
01:31:30

[models yes you know so why don't you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m32s)
01:31:32

[think that doing just directly what you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m36s)
01:31:36

[want to do doesn't work better well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m40s)
01:31:40

[because it doesn't just turns out it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m44s)
01:31:44

[doesn't empirically and the reason it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m47s)
01:31:47

[doesn't is a number of things first of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m50s)
01:31:50

[all as we know fine-tuning a pre-trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m54s)
01:31:54

[network is really powerful right so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h31m58s)
01:31:58

[we can get it to learn some related](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m01s)
01:32:01

[tasks first then we can use all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m04s)
01:32:04

[information to try and help it on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m06s)
01:32:06

[second task the other reason is IMDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m09s)
01:32:09

[movie reviews you know up to a thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m15s)
01:32:15

[words long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m18s)
01:32:18

[they're pretty big and so after reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m19s)
01:32:19

[a thousand words knowing nothing about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m22s)
01:32:22

[how English is structured or even what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m24s)
01:32:24

[the concept of a word is or punctuation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m27s)
01:32:27

[or whatever at the end of this thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m30s)
01:32:30

[integers you know they end up being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m33s)
01:32:33

[integers all you get is a 1 or a 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m35s)
01:32:35

[positive or negative and so trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m37s)
01:32:37

[like learn the entire structure of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m40s)
01:32:40

[English and then how it expresses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m42s)
01:32:42

[positive and negative sentiments from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m44s)
01:32:44

[single number is just too much to expect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m45s)
01:32:45

[so by building a language model first we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m48s)
01:32:48

[can try to build a neural network that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m51s)
01:32:51

[kind of understands the English of movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m53s)
01:32:53

[reviews and then we hope that some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m56s)
01:32:56

[the things that's learnt about are going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h32m59s)
01:32:59

[to be useful in deciding whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m02s)
01:33:02

[something's a positive or a negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m03s)
01:33:03

[nutrition that's a great question you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m05s)
01:33:05

[can pass that thanks is this similar to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m07s)
01:33:07

[the car RNN yeah this is somewhat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m12s)
01:33:12

[similar to our Olympic apathy so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m18s)
01:33:18

[famous car as in CH AR AR and in try to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m21s)
01:33:21

[predict the next letter given a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m25s)
01:33:25

[of previous letters language models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m28s)
01:33:28

[generally work at a word level they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m30s)
01:33:30

[don't have to and doing things that a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m33s)
01:33:33

[word level turns out to be can be quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m35s)
01:33:35

[a bit more powerful and we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m38s)
01:33:38

[focus on word level modeling in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m40s)
01:33:40

[course to what extent are these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m42s)
01:33:42

[generated words actually copies of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m46s)
01:33:46

[it found in the in the training data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m50s)
01:33:50

[or are these completely random things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m53s)
01:33:53

[that it actually learned and how do we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m56s)
01:33:56

[know how to distinguish between those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m57s)
01:33:57

[two yeah I mean these are awkward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h33m59s)
01:33:59

[questions the the words are definitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m01s)
01:34:01

[words we've seen before the work because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m04s)
01:34:04

[it's not at a character level so it can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m05s)
01:34:05

[only give us the word it seen before the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m07s)
01:34:07

[sentences there's a number of kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m09s)
01:34:09

[rigorous ways of doing it but I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m13s)
01:34:13

[the easiest is to get a sense of like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m14s)
01:34:14

[well here are two like different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m16s)
01:34:16

[categories where it's kind of created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m19s)
01:34:19

[very similar concepts but mixing them up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m21s)
01:34:21

[in just the right way like it it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m25s)
01:34:25

[be very hard to to do what we've seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[here just by like speeding back things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m30s)
01:34:30

[at scene before but you could of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m33s)
01:34:33

[actually go back and check you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m35s)
01:34:35

[have you seen that sentence before or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m37s)
01:34:37

[like a stream distance - have you seen a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m39s)
01:34:39

[similar sentence before in this case oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m41s)
01:34:41

[and of course another way to do it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m45s)
01:34:45

[the length most importantly when we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m47s)
01:34:47

[train the language model as we'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m49s)
01:34:49

[we'll have a validation set and so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m51s)
01:34:51

[trying to predict the next word of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m53s)
01:34:53

[something that's never seen before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m55s)
01:34:55

[and so if it's good at doing that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m57s)
01:34:57

[should be good at generating text in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h34m59s)
01:34:59

[this case the purpose the purpose is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h35m01s)
01:35:01

[to generate text that was just a fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h35m04s)
01:35:04

[example and so I'm not really gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h35m06s)

01:35:28

[actually on classification so I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h35m31s)
01:35:31

[that's the thing which is incredibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h35m34s)
01:35:34

[powerful like text classification I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h35m37s)

[this so we're going to have to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h37m50s)
01:37:50

[their own right so having downloaded the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h37m52s)
01:37:52

[data you can use the link here we do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h37m57s)
01:37:57

[usual stuff of saying the path to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h37m59s)
01:37:59

[training and validation path and as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m01s)
01:38:01

[can see it looks pretty pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m05s)
01:38:05

[traditional compared to a vision there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m06s)
01:38:06

[a directory of training there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m08s)
01:38:08

[directory of tests we don't actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m10s)
01:38:10

[have separate test and validation in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m12s)
01:38:12

[this case and just like in envision the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m14s)
01:38:14

[training directory has a bunch of files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m19s)
01:38:19

[in it in this case not representing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m22s)
01:38:22

[images but representing movie reviews so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m25s)
01:38:25

[we could cat one of those files and here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m28s)
01:38:28

[we learn about the classic zombie garand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m32s)
01:38:32

[movie I have to say with a name like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m36s)
01:38:36

[zombie gedan and an atom bomb on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m38s)
01:38:38

[front cover I was expecting a flat-out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m41s)
01:38:41

[chop-socky fun coup rent it if you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m43s)
01:38:43

[to get stoned on a Friday night and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m49s)
01:38:49

[laugh with your buddies don't rent it if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m50s)
01:38:50

[you're an uptight weenie or want a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m52s)
01:38:52

[zombie movie or lots of fresh eating I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m54s)
01:38:54

[think I'm going to enjoy zombie getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m55s)
01:38:55

[so alright so we've learned something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h38m58s)
01:38:58

[today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m00s)
01:39:00

[all right so we can just use standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m02s)
01:39:02

[UNIX stuff to see like how many words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m04s)
01:39:04

[are in the data set so the training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m06s)
01:39:06

[we've got seventeen and a half million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m08s)
01:39:08

[words test set we've got 5.6 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m12s)
01:39:12

[words so he is these are this is IMDB so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m15s)
01:39:15

[IMDB is random people this is not New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m24s)
01:39:24

[York Times listed review as far as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m27s)
01:39:27

[know okay so before we can do anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m29s)
01:39:29

[with text we have to turn it into a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m38s)
01:39:38

[of tokens token is basically like a word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m40s)
01:39:40

[right so we're going to try and turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m43s)
01:39:43

[this eventually into a list of numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m45s)
01:39:45

[so the first step is to turn it into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m47s)
01:39:47

[list of words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m49s)
01:39:49

[that's called tokenization in NLP NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m49s)
01:39:49

[has a huge lot of jargon that will we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m52s)
01:39:52

[learn over time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m55s)
01:39:55

[one thing that's a bit tricky though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m57s)
01:39:57

[when we're doing tokenization is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h39m59s)
01:39:59

[I've I've tokenized that review and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m02s)
01:40:02

[joined it back up with spaces and you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m05s)
01:40:05

[see here that wasn't has become two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m07s)
01:40:07

[tokens which makes perfect sense right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m10s)
01:40:10

[was is two things right dot dot dot has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m12s)
01:40:12

[become one token right where else lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m19s)
01:40:19

[of exclamation marks has become lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m22s)
01:40:22

[tokens so like a good tokenizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m24s)
01:40:24

[will do a good job of recognizing like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m27s)
01:40:27

[pieces of it in your sentence each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m30s)
01:40:30

[separate piece of punctuation will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m33s)
01:40:33

[separated and each part of a multi-part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m35s)
01:40:35

[word will be separated as appropriate so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m39s)
01:40:39

[Spacey is I think it's an Australian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m43s)
01:40:43

[develop piece of software actually that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m45s)
01:40:45

[does lots of you know P stuff it's got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m47s)
01:40:47

[the best tokenizer I know and so past AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m50s)
01:40:50

[is designed to work well with the Spacey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m53s)
01:40:53

[tokenizer as is torch text so here's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m55s)
01:40:55

[example of tokenization alright so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h40m58s)
01:40:58

[we do with torch text is we basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m02s)
01:41:02

[have to start out by creating something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m05s)
01:41:05

[called a field and a field is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m07s)
01:41:07

[definition of how to pre-process some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m09s)
01:41:09

[text and so here's an example with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m12s)
01:41:12

[definition of a field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m14s)
01:41:14

[it says I want to lowercase a text and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m15s)
01:41:15

[want to tokenize it with the function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m19s)
01:41:19

[called Spacey tokenize okay so it hasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m21s)
01:41:21

[done anything yet we're just telling you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m24s)
01:41:24

[when we do do something this is what to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m26s)
01:41:26

[do and so that we're going to store that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m28s)
01:41:28

[description of what to do in a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m30s)
01:41:30

[called capital text and so this is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m32s)
01:41:32

[is none of this but this is not fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m37s)
01:41:37

[specific at all this is part of torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m39s)
01:41:39

[text you can go to the torch text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m40s)
01:41:40

[website read the docs there's not lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m42s)
01:41:42

[of Doc's yet this is all very very new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m44s)
01:41:44

[so probably the best information you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m46s)
01:41:46

[find about it is in this lesson but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m49s)
01:41:49

[there's some more information on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m51s)
01:41:51

[site all right so what we can now do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m54s)
01:41:54

[go ahead and create the usual fast AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h41m57s)
01:41:57

[model data object okay and so to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m01s)
01:42:01

[the model data object we have to provide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m05s)
01:42:05

[a few bits of information but you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m07s)
01:42:07

[to say what's the training set so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m08s)
01:42:08

[path to the text files the validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m10s)
01:42:10

[set and the test set in this case just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m14s)
01:42:14

[to keep things simple I don't have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m17s)
01:42:17

[separate validation and test set so I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m18s)
01:42:18

[going to pass in the validation set for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m20s)
01:42:20

[both of those two things right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m22s)
01:42:22

[so now we can create our model data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m24s)
01:42:24

[object as per usual the first thing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m26s)
01:42:26

[give it as a path the second thing we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m29s)
01:42:29

[give it is the torch text field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m32s)
01:42:32

[definition of how to pre-process that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m34s)
01:42:34

[text the third thing we give it is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m36s)
01:42:36

[dictionary or the list of all of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m39s)
01:42:39

[files we have trained validation tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m42s)
01:42:42

[as per usual we can pass in a batch size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m45s)
01:42:45

[and then we've got a special special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m47s)
01:42:47

[couple of extra things here one is very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m50s)
01:42:50

[commonly used in NLP minimum frequency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m54s)
01:42:54

[what this says is in a moment we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h42m57s)
01:42:57

[going to be replacing every one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m01s)
01:43:01

[words with an integer which basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m03s)
01:43:03

[will be a unique index for every word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m05s)
01:43:05

[and this basically says if there are any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m08s)
01:43:08

[words that occur less than 10 times just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m10s)
01:43:10

[call it unknown right don't think of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m14s)
01:43:14

[as a word but we'll see that indeed more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m17s)
01:43:17

[detail in a moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m19s)
01:43:19

[we're going to see this in more detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m21s)
01:43:21

[as well be PTT stands for back prop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m23s)
01:43:23

[through time and this is where we define](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m26s)
01:43:26

[how long a sentence will we stick on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m28s)
01:43:28

[GPU at once so we're going to break them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m33s)
01:43:33

[up in this case we're going to break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m35s)
01:43:35

[them up into sentences of 70 tokens or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m37s)
01:43:37

[less on the whole so we're going to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m41s)
01:43:41

[all this in a moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m44s)
01:43:44

[okay so after building our model data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m45s)
01:43:45

[object right what it actually does is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m48s)
01:43:48

[it's going to fill this text field with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m51s)
01:43:51

[an additional attribute called vocab and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m55s)
01:43:55

[this is a really important and LP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h43m58s)
01:43:58

[concept I'm sorry there's so many NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m00s)
01:44:00

[concepts we just have to throw at you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m02s)
01:44:02

[kind of quickly but we'll see them a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m03s)
01:44:03

[times right the vocab is the vocabulary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m05s)
01:44:05

[and the vocabulary in NLP has a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m09s)
01:44:09

[specific meaning it is what is the list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m12s)
01:44:12

[of unique words that appear in this text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m15s)
01:44:15

[so every one of them is going to get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m17s)
01:44:17

[unique in this so let's take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m19s)
01:44:19

[integer 1 the padding unit 2 to desert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m37s)
01:44:37

[then in comma dot and of 2 and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m39s)
01:44:39

[right so this is the first 12 elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m43s)
01:44:43

[of the array of the vocab from the IMDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m47s)
01:44:47

[movie review and it's been sorted by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m52s)
01:44:52

[frequency and except for the first two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m55s)
01:44:55

[special ones so for example we can then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h44m57s)
01:44:57

[go backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m00s)
01:45:00

[s2i string to int here is the it's in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m00s)
01:45:00

[position 0 1 2 so stream to end the is 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m05s)
01:45:05

[so the vocab lets us take a word and map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m09s)
01:45:09

[it to an integer or take an integer and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m14s)
01:45:14

[that a tour word right and so that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m17s)
01:45:17

[that we can then take the first 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m20s)
01:45:20

[tokens for example of our text and turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m24s)
01:45:24

[them into twelve inch so for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m27s)
01:45:27

[here is of the agency 7 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m32s)
01:45:32

[and here you can see 7/2 right so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m35s)
01:45:35

[going to be working in this form did you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m40s)
01:45:40

[have a question deputy plus that back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m44s)
01:45:44

[there you know is it a common tyranny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m45s)
01:45:45

[stemming or limit izing not really no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m49s)
01:45:49

[generally tokenization is is what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m53s)
01:45:53

[want like with a language model we you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h45m56s)
01:45:56

[know to keep it as general as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m00s)
01:46:00

[we want to know what's coming next and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m01s)
01:46:01

[so like whether its future tense or past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m03s)
01:46:03

[tense or plural or seem to learn like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m06s)
01:46:06

[don't really know which things are going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m08s)
01:46:08

[to be interesting in which ant so it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m10s)
01:46:10

[seems that it's generally best to kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m15s)
01:46:15

[of leave it alone as much as possible be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m18s)
01:46:18

[the short answer you know having said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m21s)
01:46:21

[that as I say this is all pretty new so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m25s)
01:46:25

[if there are some particular areas that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m27s)
01:46:27

[some researcher maybe is already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m29s)
01:46:29

[discovered that some other kinds of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m30s)
01:46:30

[pre-processing you're helpful you know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m32s)
01:46:32

[wouldn't be surprised not to know about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m35s)
01:46:35

[it so we Abdullah we know you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m37s)
01:46:37

[natural language is in context important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m41s)
01:46:41

[context is very important so individual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m43s)
01:46:43

[words no no we're not looking worth this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m50s)
01:46:50

[is this look this is I just don't get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m52s)
01:46:52

[some of the big premises of this like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m54s)
01:46:54

[they're there in order yeah so just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m57s)
01:46:57

[because we replaced I with the number 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h46m59s)
01:46:59

[these are still in that order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m02s)
01:47:02

[yeah there is a different way of dealing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m05s)
01:47:05

[with natural language called a bag of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m09s)
01:47:09

[words and bag of words you through throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m11s)
01:47:11

[away the order in the context and in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m13s)
01:47:13

[machine learning course we'll be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m15s)
01:47:15

[learning about working with bag of words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m16s)
01:47:16

[representation z' but my belief is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m18s)
01:47:18

[they are no longer useful or in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m21s)
01:47:21

[verge of becoming no longer useful we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m24s)
01:47:24

[starting to learn how to use deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m26s)
01:47:26

[learning to use context properly now but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m28s)
01:47:28

[it's kind of for the first time it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m33s)
01:47:33

[really like only in the last few months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m35s)
01:47:35

[right so I mentioned that we've got two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m38s)
01:47:38

[numbers batch size and B PTT back crop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m40s)
01:47:40

[through time so this is kind of subtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m44s)
01:47:44

[so we've got some big long piece of text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m52s)
01:47:52

[okay so we've got some big long piece of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h47m58s)
01:47:58

[text you know here's our sentence it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m00s)
01:48:00

[bunch of words right and actually what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m02s)
01:48:02

[happens in a language model is even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m07s)
01:48:07

[though we have lots of movie reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m09s)
01:48:09

[they actually all get concatenated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m10s)
01:48:10

[together into one big block of text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m13s)
01:48:13

[right so it's basically predict the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m15s)
01:48:15

[word in this huge long thing which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m18s)
01:48:18

[all of the IMDB movie reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m21s)
01:48:21

[concatenated together so this thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m23s)
01:48:23

[you know what do we say it was like tens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m25s)
01:48:25

[of millions of words long and so what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m28s)
01:48:28

[do is we split it up into batches first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m31s)
01:48:31

[right so these like aerial spits into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m37s)
01:48:37

[batches right and so if we said we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m39s)
01:48:39

[a batch size of 64 we actually break the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m43s)
01:48:43

[whatever it was sixty million words into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m47s)
01:48:47

[64 sections right and then we take each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m50s)
01:48:50

[one of the 64 sections and we move it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h48m56s)
01:48:56

[like underneath the previous one I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m04s)
01:49:04

[didn't do a great job of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m07s)
01:49:07

[all right move it underneath so we end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m10s)
01:49:10

[up with a matrix which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m16s)
01:49:16

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m25s)
01:49:25

[sixty-four actually I think we've moved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m28s)
01:49:28

[them across twice so it's actually I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m32s)
01:49:32

[think just transpose it we end up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m34s)
01:49:34

[the matrix it's like 64 columns wide and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m36s)
01:49:36

[the length let's say the original was 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m40s)
01:49:40

[million right then the length is like 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m44s)
01:49:44

[million long right so each of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m48s)
01:49:48

[represents one sixty-fourth with our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m51s)
01:49:51

[entire IMDB refused it all right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m55s)
01:49:55

[that's our starting point so then what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h49m59s)
01:49:59

[we do is we then grab a little chunk of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m02s)
01:50:02

[this at a time and those chunk lengths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m06s)
01:50:06

[are approximately equal to be PTT which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m09s)
01:50:09

[I think we had equal to 70 so he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m14s)
01:50:14

[basically grab a little 70 long section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m15s)
01:50:15

[and that's the first thing we check into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m20s)
01:50:20

[our GPU that's a batch right so a batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m22s)
01:50:22

[is always of length of width 64 or batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m26s)
01:50:26

[size and each bit is a sequence of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m29s)
01:50:29

[length up to 70 so let me show you all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m33s)
01:50:33

[right so here if I go take my train data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m37s)
01:50:37

[loader I know if you folks have tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m41s)
01:50:41

[playing with this yet but you can take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m44s)
01:50:44

[any data loader wrap it with inner -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m45s)
01:50:45

[turn it into an iterator and then call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m48s)
01:50:48

[next on it to grab a batch of data just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m50s)
01:50:50

[as if you were a neural net you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m54s)
01:50:54

[exactly what the neuron that gets and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m55s)
01:50:55

[you can see here we get back a 75 by 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h50m57s)
01:50:57

[sensor right so it's 64 wide right and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m03s)
01:51:03

[said it's approximately 70 high and but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m08s)
01:51:08

[not exactly and that's actually kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m13s)
01:51:13

[interesting a really neat trick that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m16s)
01:51:16

[torch text does is they randomly change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m18s)
01:51:18

[the backprop through time number every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m22s)
01:51:22

[time so each epoch it's getting slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m25s)
01:51:25

[different bits of text this is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m28s)
01:51:28

[like in computer vision we randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m33s)
01:51:33

[shuffle the images we can't randomly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m35s)
01:51:35

[shuffle the words right because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m38s)
01:51:38

[needed to be in the right order so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m41s)
01:51:41

[instead we randomly move their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m42s)
01:51:42

[breakpoints a little bit okay so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m44s)
01:51:44

[the equivalent so in other words this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m46s)
01:51:46

[this here is of length 75 right there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m54s)
01:51:54

[a there's an ellipsis in the middle and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h51m59s)
01:51:59

[that represents the first 75 words of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m01s)
01:52:01

[the first review right where else this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m05s)
01:52:05

[75 here represents the first 75 words of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m07s)
01:52:07

[this of the second of the 64 segments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m12s)
01:52:12

[let's it have to go in like 10 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m15s)
01:52:15

[words to find that one right and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m17s)
01:52:17

[here's the first 75 words of the last of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m20s)
01:52:20

[those 64 segments okay and so then what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m23s)
01:52:23

[we have down here is the next sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m27s)
01:52:27

[right so 51 there's 51 6 1 5 there's 6 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m35s)
01:52:35

[5 25 is 25 right and in this case it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m41s)
01:52:41

[actually is of the same size it's also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m46s)
01:52:46

[75 plus 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m48s)
01:52:48

[but for minor technical reasons it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m50s)
01:52:50

[being flattened out into a single vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m52s)
01:52:52

[but basically it's exactly the same at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m54s)
01:52:54

[this matrix but it's just moved down by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h52m58s)
01:52:58

[one because we're trying to predict the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m01s)
01:53:01

[next word right so that all happens for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m05s)
01:53:05

[us right if we ask for and this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m08s)
01:53:08

[first date I know if you ask for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m11s)
01:53:11

[language model data object then it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m13s)
01:53:13

[going to create these batches of batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m17s)
01:53:17

[size width by B PTT height bits of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m20s)
01:53:20

[language corpus along with the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m26s)
01:53:26

[thing shuffled along by one word right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m29s)
01:53:29

[and so we're always going to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m32s)
01:53:32

[predict the next word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m34s)
01:53:34

[yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m37s)
01:53:37

[so why don't you instead of just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m40s)
01:53:40

[arbitrarily choosing 64 why don't you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m44s)
01:53:44

[choose like like 64 is a large number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m49s)
01:53:49

[maybe like stood by sentences and make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m52s)
01:53:52

[it a large number and then padded with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m56s)
01:53:56

[zero or something if you you know so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h53m58s)
01:53:58

[that you actually have a one full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m03s)
01:54:03

[sentence per line basically wouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m04s)
01:54:04

[that make more sense not really because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m07s)
01:54:07

[remember we're using columns right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m09s)
01:54:09

[each of our columns is of length about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m10s)
01:54:10

[10 million right so although it's true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m12s)
01:54:12

[that those columns aren't always exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m15s)
01:54:15

[finishing on a full stop there's so damn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m17s)
01:54:17

[long we don't care because they're like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m20s)
01:54:20

[10 million won and we're trying to also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m23s)
01:54:23

[line contains multiple cents incentive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m27s)
01:54:27

[column contains more costumes and sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m30s)
01:54:30

[yeah it's of length about 10 million and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m33s)
01:54:33

[it contains many many many many many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m35s)
01:54:35

[sentences because remember the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m38s)
01:54:38

[thing we did was take all thing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m40s)
01:54:40

[split it into 64 groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m42s)
01:54:42

[okay great so um I found this you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m47s)
01:54:47

[pertaining to this question this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m53s)
01:54:53

[about like what's in this language model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m55s)
01:54:55

[matrix a little mind-bending for quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h54m58s)
01:54:58

[while so don't worry if it takes a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m01s)
01:55:01

[and you have to ask a thousand questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m04s)
01:55:04

[on the forum that's fine right but go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m05s)
01:55:05

[back and listen to what I just said in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m10s)
01:55:10

[this lecture again go back to that bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m11s)
01:55:11

[where I showed you splitting it up to 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m13s)
01:55:13

[and moving them around and try it with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m14s)
01:55:14

[some sentences in Excel or something and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m16s)
01:55:16

[see if you can do a better job of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m18s)
01:55:18

[explaining it than I did okay because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m21s)
01:55:21

[this is like how torch text works and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m23s)
01:55:23

[then what fast AI adds on is this idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m27s)
01:55:27

[of like kind of how to build a a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m30s)
01:55:30

[language model out of it well they'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m31s)
01:55:31

[actually a lot of that stolen from torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m34s)
01:55:34

[text as well like there's some times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m35s)
01:55:35

[where torch text starts and fast AI ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m37s)
01:55:37

[is or vice versa trees a little saddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m39s)
01:55:39

[they really work closely together okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m42s)
01:55:42

[so now that we have a model data object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m46s)
01:55:46

[that can feed us batches we can go ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m51s)
01:55:51

[and create a model right and so in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m55s)
01:55:55

[case we're going to create an embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h55m58s)
01:55:58

[matrix and our vocab we can see how big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m01s)
01:56:01

[a vocab was let's have a look back here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m05s)
01:56:05

[so we can see here in the model data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m09s)
01:56:09

[object there are four thousand six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m13s)
01:56:13

[hundred and two kind of pieces that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m15s)
01:56:15

[we're going to go through that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m19s)
01:56:19

[basically equal to the number of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m20s)
01:56:20

[total length of everything divided by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m24s)
01:56:24

[batch size times B PTT and this one I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m26s)
01:56:26

[wanted to show you NT I've got the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m29s)
01:56:29

[definition up here number of unique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m32s)
01:56:32

[tokens NT is the number of tokens that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m34s)
01:56:34

[the size of our vocab so we've got three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m36s)
01:56:36

[thirty four thousand nine hundred and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m39s)
01:56:39

[forty five unique words and notice the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m40s)
01:56:40

[unique words that had to appear at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m44s)
01:56:44

[ten times okay because otherwise they've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m46s)
01:56:46

[been replaced with the length of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m49s)
01:56:49

[data set is one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m56s)
01:56:56

[because as far as the language model is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m58s)
01:56:58

[concerned there's only one thing which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h56m59s)
01:56:59

[is the whole corpus all right and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m02s)
01:57:02

[that thing has I hear it is twenty point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m05s)
01:57:05

[six million words you know right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m08s)
01:57:08

[so those thirty four thousand hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m12s)
01:57:12

[and forty five things are used to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m15s)
01:57:15

[an embedding matrix of number of rows is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m17s)
01:57:17

[equal to thirty four nine four five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m22s)
01:57:22

[right and so the first one represents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m28s)
01:57:28

[UNK the second one represents pad the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m31s)
01:57:31

[third one was dot the fourth one was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m36s)
01:57:36

[comma with one under sketching was there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m38s)
01:57:38

[and so forth right and so each one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m41s)
01:57:41

[these gets an embedding vector so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m44s)
01:57:44

[is literally identical to what we did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m48s)
01:57:48

[before the brick right this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m50s)
01:57:50

[categorical variable it's just a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m53s)
01:57:53

[high cardinality categorical variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m56s)
01:57:56

[and furthermore it's the only variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h57m58s)
01:57:58

[right this is pretty standard in NLP you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m00s)
01:58:00

[have a variable which is a word right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m03s)
01:58:03

[you have a single categorical variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m07s)
01:58:07

[single column basically and it's it's of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m09s)
01:58:09

[thirty four thousand nine hundred forty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m13s)
01:58:13

[five cardinality categorical variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m16s)
01:58:16

[and so we're going to create an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m19s)
01:58:19

[embedding matrix for it so M size is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m20s)
01:58:20

[size of the omitting vector 200 okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m25s)
01:58:25

[so that's going to be length 200 a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m28s)
01:58:28

[bigger than our previous embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m31s)
01:58:31

[vectors not surprising because a word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m32s)
01:58:32

[has a lot more nuance to it than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m34s)
01:58:34

[concept of Sunday right or Russ means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m37s)
01:58:37

[Berlin's door or whatever right so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m42s)
01:58:42

[generally an embedding size for a word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m45s)
01:58:45

[will be somewhere between about 50 and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m47s)
01:58:47

[about 600 okay so I've kind of done some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m49s)
01:58:49

[in the middle we then have to say as per](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m52s)
01:58:52

[usual how many activations do you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m56s)
01:58:56

[in your layers so we're going to use 500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h58m58s)
01:58:58

[and then how many layers do you want in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m01s)
01:59:01

[your neural net we're going to use three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m02s)
01:59:02

[okay this is a minor technical detail it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m04s)
01:59:04

[turns out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m10s)
01:59:10

[that we're going to learn later about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m11s)
01:59:11

[the atom optimizer that basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m13s)
01:59:13

[defaults for it don't work very well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m16s)
01:59:16

[with these kinds of models so you just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m17s)
01:59:17

[have to change some of these you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m19s)
01:59:19

[basically any time you're doing NLP you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m21s)
01:59:21

[should probably include this mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m24s)
01:59:24

[because it works pretty well so having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m27s)
01:59:27

[done that we can now again take our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m31s)
01:59:31

[model data object and grab a model out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m34s)
01:59:34

[of it and we can pass in a few different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m36s)
01:59:36

[things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m38s)
01:59:38

[what optimization function do we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m38s)
01:59:38

[how big an embedding do we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m41s)
01:59:41

[how many hidden activate how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m43s)
01:59:43

[activations number of Hitler how many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m45s)
01:59:45

[layers and how much drop out of many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m47s)
01:59:47

[different kinds so this language model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m51s)
01:59:51

[we're going to use is a very recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m55s)
01:59:55

[development called AWD LS TM by Steven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=01h59m56s)
01:59:56

[marady who's a NLP research based in San](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m00s)
02:00:00

[Francisco and his main contribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m03s)
02:00:03

[really was to show like how to put drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m05s)
02:00:05

[out all over the place in in these NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m09s)
02:00:09

[models so we're not going to worry now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m13s)
02:00:13

[we'll do this in the last lecture is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m15s)
02:00:15

[worrying about like what all that like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m17s)
02:00:17

[what is the architecture and what are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m18s)
02:00:18

[all these dropouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m20s)
02:00:20

[for now just know is the same as per](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m21s)
02:00:21

[usual if you try to build an NLP model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m24s)
02:00:24

[and draw underfitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m26s)
02:00:26

[and decrease all of these dropouts if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m28s)
02:00:28

[you're overfitting then increase all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m31s)
02:00:31

[these dropouts in roughly this ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m33s)
02:00:33

[okay that's that's my rule of thumb and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m36s)
02:00:36

[again this is such a recent paper nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m39s)
02:00:39

[else is working on this model anyway so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m44s)
02:00:44

[there's not a lot of guidance but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m45s)
02:00:45

[found this these ratios worked well it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m47s)
02:00:47

[what Stephens been using as well there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m50s)
02:00:50

[another kind of way we can avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m53s)
02:00:53

[overfitting that we'll talk about in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m55s)
02:00:55

[last class again for now this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m57s)
02:00:57

[actually works totally reliably so all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h00m59s)
02:00:59

[of your NLP models probably want this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m02s)
02:01:02

[particular line of code and then this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m04s)
02:01:04

[point we're going to talk about at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m09s)
02:01:09

[end last lecture as well you can always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m10s)
02:01:10

[improve this basically what it says is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m12s)
02:01:12

[when you do when you look at your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m17s)
02:01:17

[gradients and you multiply them by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m20s)
02:01:20

[learning rate and you decide how much to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m21s)
02:01:21

[update you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m23s)
02:01:23

[or weights by this is clip them like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m24s)
02:01:24

[literally like sit like don't let them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m29s)
02:01:29

[be more than 0.3 and this is quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m32s)
02:01:32

[cool little trick right because like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m36s)
02:01:36

[you're learning rates pretty high and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m41s)
02:01:41

[you kind of don't want to get in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m43s)
02:01:43

[situation we talked about where you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m45s)
02:01:45

[kind of got this kind of thing where you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m49s)
02:01:49

[go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m51s)
02:01:51

[you know rather than little snippets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m54s)
02:01:54

[that little step instead you go like Oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m55s)
02:01:55

[too big Oh too big right with gradient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h01m57s)
02:01:57

[clipping it kind of goes this far and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m01s)
02:02:01

[it's like oh my goodness I'm going too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m03s)
02:02:03

[far I'll stop and that's basically what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m05s)
02:02:05

[gradient flipping does so anyway so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m07s)
02:02:07

[these are a bunch of parameters the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m12s)
02:02:12

[details don't matter too much right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m14s)
02:02:14

[you can just deal these and then we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m15s)
02:02:15

[go ahead and call fit with exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m19s)
02:02:19

[same parameters as usual so Jeremy um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m23s)
02:02:23

[there are all this other work embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m30s)
02:02:30

[things like like worked vague and glow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m35s)
02:02:35

[so I have two questions about that one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m38s)
02:02:38

[is how are those different from these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m41s)
02:02:41

[and the second question why don't you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m44s)
02:02:44

[initialize them with one of those yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m47s)
02:02:47

[so so basically that's a great question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m50s)
02:02:50

[so basically people have pre trained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m54s)
02:02:54

[these embedding matrices before to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h02m57s)
02:02:57

[various other tasks they're not called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m00s)
02:03:00

[pre-trained models they're just a pre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m02s)
02:03:02

[trained embedding matrix and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m04s)
02:03:04

[download them and as unit says they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m06s)
02:03:06

[names like word to Veck and love and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m09s)
02:03:09

[they're literally just a matrix there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m11s)
02:03:11

[no reason we couldn't download them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m15s)
02:03:15

[really it's just like kind of I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m17s)
02:03:17

[that building a whole pre-trained model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m24s)
02:03:24

[in this way didn't seem to benefit much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m27s)
02:03:27

[if at all from using pre trained word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m30s)
02:03:30

[vectors where else using a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m32s)
02:03:32

[pre-trained language model made a much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m33s)
02:03:33

[bigger difference so I can remember what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m36s)
02:03:36

[a big those of you who saw word Tyvek it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m38s)
02:03:38

[made a big splash when it came out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m40s)
02:03:40

[I mean I'm finding this technique of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m43s)
02:03:43

[pre-trained language models seems much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m46s)
02:03:46

[more powerful basically but I think we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m48s)
02:03:48

[can combine both to make them a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m51s)
02:03:51

[better still what what is the model that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m52s)
02:03:52

[you have used like how can I know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m57s)
02:03:57

[architecture of the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h03m58s)
02:03:58

[so we'll be learning about the model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m01s)
02:04:01

[architecture in the last lesson and for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m03s)
02:04:03

[now it's a recurrent neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m05s)
02:04:05

[using something called an LS TN long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m08s)
02:04:08

[short-term memory okay so so if they had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m10s)
02:04:10

[lots of details that we're skipping over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m18s)
02:04:18

[but you know you can do all this without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m20s)
02:04:20

[any of those details we go ahead and fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m22s)
02:04:22

[the model I found that this language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m25s)
02:04:25

[model took quite a while to fit so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m28s)
02:04:28

[kind of like ran it for a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m29s)
02:04:29

[noticed it was still under fitting safer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m31s)
02:04:31

[it was up to ran it a bit more longer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m34s)
02:04:34

[cycle length saved it again it still was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m37s)
02:04:37

[kind of under fitting you know run it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m40s)
02:04:40

[again and kind of finally got to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m43s)
02:04:43

[point where it's like kind of honestly I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m45s)
02:04:45

[kind of ran out of patience so I just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m47s)
02:04:47

[like saved it at that point and I did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m49s)
02:04:49

[the same kind of tests that we looked at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m54s)
02:04:54

[before so I was like oh it wasn't quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m55s)
02:04:55

[expecting but I realized it anyway the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m58s)
02:04:58

[best and the most like okay let's see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h04m59s)
02:04:59

[how that goes the best performance with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m01s)
02:05:01

[one movie were I say okay it looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m03s)
02:05:03

[the language models working pretty well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m05s)
02:05:05

[so I've pre-trained a language model and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m07s)
02:05:07

[so now I want to use it fine tune it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m13s)
02:05:13

[do classification sentiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m16s)
02:05:16

[classification now obviously if I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m18s)
02:05:18

[gonna use a pre trained model I need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m20s)
02:05:20

[use exactly the same vocab but the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m22s)
02:05:22

[word the still needs to map for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m25s)
02:05:25

[number two so that I can look up the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m27s)
02:05:27

[vector that right so that's why I first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m29s)
02:05:29

[of all load back up my my field object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m33s)
02:05:33

[the thing with the vocab in right now in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m37s)
02:05:37

[this case if I ran it straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m40s)
02:05:40

[afterwards this is unnecessary it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m42s)
02:05:42

[already in memory but this means I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m44s)
02:05:44

[come back to this later right in a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m46s)
02:05:46

[session basically I can then go ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m49s)
02:05:49

[and say okay I've never got one more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m55s)
02:05:55

[field right in addition to my field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m56s)
02:05:56

[which represents the reviews I've also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h05m59s)
02:05:59

[got a field which represents the label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m02s)
02:06:02

[okay and the details are too important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m04s)
02:06:04

[here now this time I need to not treat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m08s)
02:06:08

[the whole thing as one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m12s)
02:06:12

[big piece of text but every review is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m13s)
02:06:13

[separate because each one has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m16s)
02:06:16

[different sentiment attached to it but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m18s)
02:06:18

[it so happens that torch text already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m20s)
02:06:20

[has a data set that does that for IMDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m22s)
02:06:22

[so I just used IMDB built into torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m25s)
02:06:25

[text so basically once we've done all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m29s)
02:06:29

[that we end up with something where we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m32s)
02:06:32

[can like grab for a particular example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m33s)
02:06:33

[or you can grab its label positive and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m36s)
02:06:36

[here's some of the text this is another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m39s)
02:06:39

[great Tom Berenger movie all right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m41s)
02:06:41

[this is all not nothing faster I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m45s)
02:06:45

[specific here we'll come back to it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m48s)
02:06:48

[the last lecture but torch text Docs can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m50s)
02:06:50

[help understand what's going on all you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m53s)
02:06:53

[need to know is that once you've used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m55s)
02:06:55

[this special tox torch text thing called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h06m57s)
02:06:57

[splits to grab a Spitz object you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m00s)
02:07:00

[passed it straight into faster a text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m03s)
02:07:03

[data from splits and that basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m06s)
02:07:06

[converts a torch text object into a fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m08s)
02:07:08

[AI object we can train on so as soon as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m12s)
02:07:12

[you've done that you can just go ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m15s)
02:07:15

[and say get model right and that gets us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m17s)
02:07:17

[our learner and then we can load into it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m20s)
02:07:20

[the pre trained model the language model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m23s)
02:07:23

[right and so we can now take that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m26s)
02:07:26

[pre-trained language model and use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m29s)
02:07:29

[stuff that we're kind of familiar with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m32s)
02:07:32

[right so we can make sure all that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m34s)
02:07:34

[know all its at the last layers frozen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m37s)
02:07:37

[training a bit unfreeze it train it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m39s)
02:07:39

[bit and the nice thing is once you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m42s)
02:07:42

[got a pre trained language model it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m44s)
02:07:44

[actually trains super fast you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m47s)
02:07:47

[here it's like a couple of minutes for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m49s)
02:07:49

[epoch and it only took me to get my is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m51s)
02:07:51

[my best one here and he took me like 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m55s)
02:07:55

[a box so it's like 20 minutes to train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m57s)
02:07:57

[this bit it's really fast and I ended up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h07m59s)
02:07:59

[with 94.5% so how gone is 94.5% well it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m03s)
02:08:03

[so happens that actually one of Steven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m10s)
02:08:10

[verities colleagues James Bradbury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m14s)
02:08:14

[recently created a paper looking at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m15s)
02:08:15

[state at like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m21s)
02:08:21

[they tried to create a new state of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m22s)
02:08:22

[art for a bunch of NLP things and one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m23s)
02:08:23

[the things that looked at was IMDB and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m25s)
02:08:25

[they actually have here a list of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m28s)
02:08:28

[current world's best for IMDB and even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m31s)
02:08:31

[with stuff that is highly specialized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m36s)
02:08:36

[for sentiment analysis the best anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m38s)
02:08:38

[had previously come up with 94.1 so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m40s)
02:08:40

[other words this technique getting 94.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m44s)
02:08:44

[it's literally better than anybody has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m47s)
02:08:47

[created in the world before as far as we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m51s)
02:08:51

[know or as far as James Bradbury knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m55s)
02:08:55

[so so when I say like there are big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h08m57s)
02:08:57

[opportunities to use this I mean like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m01s)
02:09:01

[this is a technique that nobody else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m03s)
02:09:03

[currently has access to which you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m05s)
02:09:05

[you could like you know whatever iBM has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m08s)
02:09:08

[in what CERN or whatever any big company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m12s)
02:09:12

[has you know that they're advertising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m14s)
02:09:14

[unless they have some secret sauce that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m17s)
02:09:17

[they're not publishing which they don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m19s)
02:09:19

[right because people get you know if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m21s)
02:09:21

[they have a better thing they publish it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m23s)
02:09:23

[then you now have access to a better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m24s)
02:09:24

[text classification method then has ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m27s)
02:09:27

[existed before so I really hope that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m29s)
02:09:29

[know you can try this out and see how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m32s)
02:09:32

[you go there may be some things it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m34s)
02:09:34

[really well on and others that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m39s)
02:09:39

[doesn't work as well and I don't know I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m40s)
02:09:40

[think this kind of sweet spot here that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m42s)
02:09:42

[we had about 25,000 you know short to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m46s)
02:09:46

[medium size documents if you don't have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m50s)
02:09:50

[at least that much text it may be hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m52s)
02:09:52

[to train a different language model but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m55s)
02:09:55

[having said that there's a lot more we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m57s)
02:09:57

[do here right and we won't be able to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h09m59s)
02:09:59

[it in part 1 of this course but in part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m01s)
02:10:01

[2 that for example we could start like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m03s)
02:10:03

[training language models that look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m06s)
02:10:06

[like you know lots and lots of medical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m08s)
02:10:08

[journals and then we could like make a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m11s)
02:10:11

[downloadable medical language model that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m13s)
02:10:13

[then anybody could use to like fine tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m15s)
02:10:15

[on like a prostate cancer subset of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m18s)
02:10:18

[medical literature for instance like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m21s)
02:10:21

[there's so much we could do it's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m23s)
02:10:23

[exciting and then you know to the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m26s)
02:10:26

[point we could also combine this with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m28s)
02:10:28

[like pre-trained word vectors it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m30s)
02:10:30

[even without trying that hard like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m32s)
02:10:32

[you know we even without use like we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m36s)
02:10:36

[could have pre-trained a Wikipedia say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m39s)
02:10:39

[corpus language model and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m41s)
02:10:41

[fine-tuned it into a IMDB language model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m43s)
02:10:43

[and then fine tune that into an IBM IMDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m47s)
02:10:47

[sentiment analysis model and we would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m49s)
02:10:49

[have got something better than this so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m51s)
02:10:51

[like this I really think this is the tip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m54s)
02:10:54

[of the iceberg and I was talking there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h10m56s)
02:10:56

[a really fantastic researcher called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m00s)
02:11:00

[Sebastian Reuter who is basically the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m02s)
02:11:02

[only NLP researcher I know who's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m05s)
02:11:05

[really really writing a lot about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m07s)
02:11:07

[pre-training and fine tuning and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m10s)
02:11:10

[transfer learning and NLP and I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m13s)
02:11:13

[asking him like why isn't this happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m15s)
02:11:15

[more and his view was it's because there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m17s)
02:11:17

[isn't the software to make it easy you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m20s)
02:11:20

[know so I'm actually going to share this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m23s)
02:11:23

[lecture with with him tomorrow because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m25s)
02:11:25

[you know it feels like there's you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m29s)
02:11:29

[hopefully gonna be a lot of stuff coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m32s)
02:11:32

[out now that we're making it really easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m34s)
02:11:34

[to do this ok we're kind of out of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m36s)
02:11:36

[so what I'll do is I'll quickly look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m43s)
02:11:43

[collaborative filtering introduction and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m45s)
02:11:45

[then we'll finish it next time but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m48s)
02:11:48

[collaborative filtering there's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m50s)
02:11:50

[very little new to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m52s)
02:11:52

[we've basically learned everything we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m53s)
02:11:53

[gonna need so collaborative filtering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m55s)
02:11:55

[will will cover this quite quickly next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h11m59s)
02:11:59

[week and then we're going to do a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m02s)
02:12:02

[deep dive into collaborative filtering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m04s)
02:12:04

[next week where we're going to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m06s)
02:12:06

[about like we're actually going to from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m09s)
02:12:09

[scratch learn how to do mr. plastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m10s)
02:12:10

[gradient descent how to create loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m13s)
02:12:13

[functions how they work exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m15s)
02:12:15

[and then we'll grow from there and will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m18s)
02:12:18

[gradually build back up to really deeply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m19s)
02:12:19

[understand what's going on in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m22s)
02:12:22

[structured models and then what's going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m25s)
02:12:25

[on in confidence and then finally what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m27s)
02:12:27

[going on in recurrent neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m28s)
02:12:28

[and hopefully we'll be able to build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m30s)
02:12:30

[them all from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m32s)
02:12:32

[ok so this is kind of a gonna be really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m33s)
02:12:33

[important this movie lens data set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m36s)
02:12:36

[because we've got a user to learn a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m38s)
02:12:38

[of like really foundational theory and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m39s)
02:12:39

[kind of math behind it so the movie lens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m43s)
02:12:43

[data set this is basically what it looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m46s)
02:12:46

[like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m49s)
02:12:49

[it contains a bunch of ratings it says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m50s)
02:12:50

[user number one watched movie number 31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m52s)
02:12:52

[and they gave it a rating of two and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m56s)
02:12:56

[half at this particular time and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h12m58s)
02:12:58

[they watched movie 102 nine and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h13m02s)
02:13:02

[gave it a rating of three and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h13m05s)
02:13:05

[watched reading one one's really one one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h13m06s)
02:13:06

[seven two and they gave it a rating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h13m08s)
02:13:08

[before okay and so forth okay so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h13m09s)
02:13:09

[the ratings table this is really the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h13m12s)
02:13:12

[only one that matters and our goal will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbceqO8PpBg#t=02h13m13s)
