[caught up on all the stuff here on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h01m57s)

[forum looking at this curating listen at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h01m58s)
00:01:58

[experiments rapidly probably very close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m01s)
00:02:01

[to CERN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m03s)
00:02:03

[so a couple of little changes I made in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m06s)
00:02:06

[my experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m10s)
00:02:10

[I tried thinking about like why'd what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[quite appear if you pointed out how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m14s)
00:02:14

[depending on what your starting point is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m15s)
00:02:15

[to your optimizer you get to a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m17s)
00:02:17

[different place and so clearly our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m20s)
00:02:20

[convex optimization is I'm not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m23s)
00:02:23

[necessarily finding a local minimum but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m27s)
00:02:27

[at least saddle point is not getting out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m28s)
00:02:28

[of so I tried something which was to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m29s)
00:02:29

[create a take the random image and just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m32s)
00:02:32

[add a Gaussian blur to it so calcium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m35s)
00:02:35

[filter is just a blur and so that makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m38s)
00:02:38

[the random image into this kind of thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m40s)
00:02:40

[and I just found that even the playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m42s)
00:02:42

[style looks a lot smoother and that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m46s)
00:02:46

[one change that I made which I thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m48s)
00:02:48

[worked quite well another change that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m50s)
00:02:50

[made just to play around with it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[they added a different weight to each of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m54s)
00:02:54

[the style layers and so my mosaic now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h02m57s)
00:02:57

[has a third thing in which is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m02s)
00:03:02

[weights notice modified by the weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m03s)
00:03:03

[and so I thought that those two things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m05s)
00:03:05

[made my little bird book a significantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m07s)
00:03:07

[better than motor Bieber book before so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m10s)
00:03:10

[I thank you in that you could do a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m12s)
00:03:12

[similar thing for content loss you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[and also maybe add more different layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m16s)
00:03:16

[of content lost and pick some different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m18s)
00:03:18

[weights as well and I'm sure if anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m20s)
00:03:20

[tried that as yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[particular question and the question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m30s)
00:03:30

[regards I remember cartoon the cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m33s)
00:03:33

[and we think of transferring the style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m36s)
00:03:36

[what we really mean is transferring the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m38s)
00:03:38

[contours of the cartoons redraw the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m40s)
00:03:40

[content in that style and this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m43s)
00:03:43

[what style transferring is doing here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m45s)
00:03:45

[how might one implemented yeah I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[know that anybody's quite to get that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m51s)
00:03:51

[out but I'll show you a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m52s)
00:03:52

[directions that may be useful as yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m53s)
00:03:53

[I've tried selecting activations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h03m59s)
00:03:59

[correspond with edges and such as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m01s)
00:04:01

[indicated by one of the cons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m03s)
00:04:03

[visualization papers and sharing outputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m04s)
00:04:04

[or specifically those activation yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m06s)
00:04:06

[yeah so I'll show you something so some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m10s)
00:04:10

[things you could try I haven't seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m12s)
00:04:12

[anybody through a great focus yet but I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m13s)
00:04:13

[mean here's one example from the from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m15s)
00:04:15

[the forum is somebody pointed out that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m18s)
00:04:18

[it's cartoon approach didn't work very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m20s)
00:04:20

[well with dota 2 but then when they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m22s)
00:04:22

[change their initial image not to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m24s)
00:04:24

[random but to be the picture of the dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m27s)
00:04:27

[it actually looked quite a lot better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m28s)
00:04:28

[and so there's one thing you could try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m30s)
00:04:30

[there's some very helpful diagrams and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m32s)
00:04:32

[some somebody posed too which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m34s)
00:04:34

[fantastic is summarizing what we learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m36s)
00:04:36

[I liked this summary of what happens if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m39s)
00:04:39

[you add versus remove each layer so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m42s)
00:04:42

[is what happens if you remove block 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m46s)
00:04:46

[block 1 to block 3 and block 4 to get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m49s)
00:04:49

[sense of how they impact things so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m54s)
00:04:54

[can see for the style that the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m56s)
00:04:56

[layer is really important to making it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h04m58s)
00:04:58

[little group coming to the finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m00s)
00:05:00

[why don't you have some particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m05s)
00:05:05

[nice examples I loved it like seems like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m08s)
00:05:08

[there's a certain taste they're kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m11s)
00:05:11

[figuring out what photos covered what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m13s)
00:05:13

[images like of this Einstein the truth I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m15s)
00:05:15

[thought this wasn't terrific as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m17s)
00:05:17

[Brad came up with this really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m21s)
00:05:21

[interesting insight that starting with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m24s)
00:05:24

[this picture and adding that style to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m26s)
00:05:26

[creates this extraordinary shape here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m28s)
00:05:28

[whereas expense out you can tell us the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m32s)
00:05:32

[man sitting in the corner but is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m34s)
00:05:34

[ten brushstrokes but sometimes is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m36s)
00:05:36

[what can survive being Bishop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m39s)
00:05:39

[surprisingly fantastic um I have no idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m41s)
00:05:41

[what this is even in the photo so I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m45s)
00:05:45

[noticed what the fan thing I did I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m46s)
00:05:46

[I don't watch that kind of music enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m49s)
00:05:49

[so there's lots of interesting ideas you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m52s)
00:05:52

[can try and I've got a link here in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m56s)
00:05:56

[you might have seen it in the PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m57s)
00:05:57

[to a Kaos implementation that has a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h05m59s)
00:05:59

[whole list of things that you can try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m02s)
00:06:02

[and here are some particular examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m03s)
00:06:03

[this is something called and all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m08s)
00:06:08

[these examples you can get the details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m11s)
00:06:11

[shown in certainly there's something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m13s)
00:06:13

[called chain blurring and to some things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m16s)
00:06:16

[this is this might work for cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m18s)
00:06:18

[notice how the matrix doesn't do a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m20s)
00:06:20

[job with the cat when you use the bullet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m23s)
00:06:23

[classic this is our paper right but if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m26s)
00:06:26

[you use this chain word approach it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m29s)
00:06:29

[a fantastic job and so I wonder if that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m31s)
00:06:31

[might be one secret to the cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m33s)
00:06:33

[some of you I saw in the forum we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m37s)
00:06:37

[already tried this which is using color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m39s)
00:06:39

[preservation and luminance matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m41s)
00:06:41

[which basically means you're still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m43s)
00:06:43

[taking the style which you're not taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m45s)
00:06:45

[the color and I think in these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m47s)
00:06:47

[particular examples this is really great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m49s)
00:06:49

[results I think it depends a lot on what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m52s)
00:06:52

[working to try to lose and you can go a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m54s)
00:06:54

[lot further for example you can add a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h06m58s)
00:06:58

[mask and then say just to color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m00s)
00:07:00

[preservation for one part of the photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m03s)
00:07:03

[so here the top part of the photo has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m05s)
00:07:05

[got color preservation and the bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m07s)
00:07:07

[hasn't for evil um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m09s)
00:07:09

[they even show in that code how you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m12s)
00:07:12

[use a mask to say one part of my image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m16s)
00:07:16

[should not be stylized and again I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m19s)
00:07:19

[getting somebody results well it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m22s)
00:07:22

[really crazy use masks to decide which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m26s)
00:07:26

[one of two style images to use and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m29s)
00:07:29

[you can really generate some creative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m32s)
00:07:32

[stuff so as one of the suspects we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m33s)
00:07:33

[play with them you can go beyond this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m35s)
00:07:35

[coming up at your own areas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m37s)
00:07:37

[now some of the best stuff you're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m40s)
00:07:40

[to learn a bit more today about how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m42s)
00:07:42

[do some of these things better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m44s)
00:07:44

[but just to give an idea if you go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m45s)
00:07:45

[like move net you can literally draw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m47s)
00:07:47

[something using four colors and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m50s)
00:07:50

[choose a style image and it will turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m54s)
00:07:54

[your drawing into an inch it's basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h07m57s)
00:07:57

[a deadly with blue is going to be water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m00s)
00:08:00

[and green is going to be full edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m02s)
00:08:02

[because red is going to be foreground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m03s)
00:08:03

[but there's a lot of good examples of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m08s)
00:08:08

[this kind of neural doodle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m11s)
00:08:11

[they call it automate something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m13s)
00:08:13

[we'll learn more about how to do better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m16s)
00:08:16

[today is if you've got a fine layer comm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m18s)
00:08:18

[there's a very rich and paper cortex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m20s)
00:08:20

[depicts which is basically we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m22s)
00:08:22

[to be learning quite a bit in this class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m25s)
00:08:25

[about how to do segmentation which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m26s)
00:08:26

[where you take a photo and turn it into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m29s)
00:08:29

[a comet image basically saying the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m31s)
00:08:31

[horses here the bicycles here the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m33s)
00:08:33

[person's here this is basically doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m34s)
00:08:34

[the opposite is that by drawing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m36s)
00:08:36

[something saying I want you to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m38s)
00:08:38

[something that has a window here and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m40s)
00:08:40

[windowsill here and draw here and column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m43s)
00:08:43

[there and it generates a photo which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m45s)
00:08:45

[fairly remarkable so the stuff we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m48s)
00:08:48

[learnt so far won't quite get you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m52s)
00:08:52

[through these two things but by the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m54s)
00:08:54

[of the day we should be able to this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m55s)
00:08:55

[a nice example that I think some folks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h08m59s)
00:08:59

[at Adobe built showing that you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m02s)
00:09:02

[basically draw something and it will try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m04s)
00:09:04

[and generate an image that is close to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m08s)
00:09:08

[your drawing where you just needed a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m10s)
00:09:10

[small number of lines and again you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m11s)
00:09:11

[find this but we'll link to this paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m14s)
00:09:14

[from the resources and this actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m16s)
00:09:16

[shows to you in real time you can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m19s)
00:09:19

[that this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m21s)
00:09:21

[there's some new way of doing art that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m23s)
00:09:23

[studies work here where you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m26s)
00:09:26

[necessarily need a lot of technique I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[not commenting it's going to tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m30s)
00:09:30

[into a bear got but you can at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m32s)
00:09:32

[generate images that may be in your head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m33s)
00:09:33

[in some style that someone's doing a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m35s)
00:09:35

[of somebody else's I think it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[interesting okay one thing I was thrill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m39s)
00:09:39

[to see is that at least two of you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m46s)
00:09:46

[already written blog post so I'm medium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[that was fantastic see so I hope more if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[you might try to do that this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m55s)
00:09:55

[definitely doesn't need to be something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m57s)
00:09:57

[that takes a long time and I know some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h09m59s)
00:09:59

[of you already planet also planning on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m03s)
00:10:03

[telling your forum posts into blog posts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m05s)
00:10:05

[hopefully we'll see a lot more blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m08s)
00:10:08

[posts this week and popping on I know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m10s)
00:10:10

[the people have done that have found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m13s)
00:10:13

[that a digital experience as well so one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m14s)
00:10:14

[of the things that I suggested doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m19s)
00:10:19

[pretty high on the list of priorities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m21s)
00:10:21

[for this week's assignment was to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m23s)
00:10:23

[through the paper knowing what it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m26s)
00:10:26

[going to say you know I think this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m30s)
00:10:30

[really helpful is when you already know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m31s)
00:10:31

[how to do something is to go back over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m33s)
00:10:33

[that paper and this is a great way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m35s)
00:10:35

[learn how to repeat it because you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m37s)
00:10:37

[already know what it's telling you this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m39s)
00:10:39

[is like the way I learn to read papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m41s)
00:10:41

[was totally this method so I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m45s)
00:10:45

[come through and I've highlighted a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m48s)
00:10:48

[key things which I as I went through I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m50s)
00:10:50

[thought were kind of important so in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m52s)
00:10:52

[abstract of the paper but let me ask say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m55s)
00:10:55

[how many people kind of went back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h10m58s)
00:10:58

[relook to this paper again but a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m00s)
00:11:00

[okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m03s)
00:11:03

[abstracts they basically say what is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m08s)
00:11:08

[they're reducing so it's a system based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m10s)
00:11:10

[on a deep neural network that create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m11s)
00:11:11

[artistic images and high perceptual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m13s)
00:11:13

[quality okay so we're going to read this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m15s)
00:11:15

[paper and hopefully at the end of it we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m16s)
00:11:16

[will know how to do that then in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m18s)
00:11:18

[first section there tell us about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m21s)
00:11:21

[basic ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m24s)
00:11:24

[so when CNN's obtained an object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m25s)
00:11:25

[recognition they developed a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m28s)
00:11:28

[representation of an image along the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m29s)
00:11:29

[processing hierarchy that network is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[transformed into representations to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m35s)
00:11:35

[increasingly care about the actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m36s)
00:11:36

[content compared to the pixel values so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m38s)
00:11:38

[it describes the basic idea of content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m42s)
00:11:42

[models and then they describe the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m44s)
00:11:44

[idea of spiralize which is looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m47s)
00:11:47

[the correlations between the different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m50s)

[filter responses over the spatial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m52s)

[extents of the picture nests and it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m54s)
00:11:54

[one of these sentences that read on its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m56s)
00:11:56

[own doesn't mean very much now that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h11m58s)
00:11:58

[know how to do it you can read it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m01s)
00:12:01

[this way okay okay so what that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m02s)
00:12:02

[and then when you get to the method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m04s)
00:12:04

[section we learn more so the idea here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m06s)
00:12:06

[is that by including the feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m09s)
00:12:09

[correlation so this answers one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m11s)
00:12:11

[questions that we want to be had on a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m13s)
00:12:13

[form by including feature correlations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m14s)
00:12:14

[of multiple layers we obtained a multi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m16s)
00:12:16

[scale representation of the input image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m19s)
00:12:19

[this idea of a multi scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m21s)
00:12:21

[representation is something we're gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m23s)
00:12:23

[be coming for across a lot because a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m24s)
00:12:24

[of this as we discussed last week a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m27s)
00:12:27

[of this class is about generative models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m29s)
00:12:29

[and one of the tricky things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m31s)
00:12:31

[generative models is both to get the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m34s)
00:12:34

[kind of the general idea of the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m36s)
00:12:36

[you're trying to generate correct should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m39s)
00:12:39

[also get all the details correct and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m41s)
00:12:41

[the details generally requires you to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m43s)
00:12:43

[zoom in to a small scale and getting the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m45s)
00:12:45

[kind of big picture corrected about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m47s)
00:12:47

[zooming out to a large scale so this was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m49s)
00:12:49

[one of the key things that in this paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m52s)
00:12:52

[was show you how to create a spiral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m54s)
00:12:54

[representation that included multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m55s)
00:12:55

[resolutions and we know now know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h12m58s)
00:12:58

[where they did that was to use multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m00s)
00:13:00

[style layers and as we go through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m02s)
00:13:02

[layers of each eg they gradually become](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m05s)
00:13:05

[lower and lower resolution uttering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m07s)
00:13:07

[larger receptive fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m10s)
00:13:10

[creates a look at the figures and make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[sure another thrill to see that some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m16s)
00:13:16

[you were trying to recreate these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m18s)
00:13:18

[figures which actually turns out to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m20s)
00:13:20

[slightly non-trivial so we can see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[exactly what that figure is and if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m26s)
00:13:26

[haven't tried it for yourself yet you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m29s)
00:13:29

[might want to try it see if you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m31s)
00:13:31

[recreate this figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m32s)
00:13:32

[um okay it's good to try and find in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m38s)
00:13:38

[paper the key finding you know the key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m42s)
00:13:42

[the key thing that they're showing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m44s)
00:13:44

[this case they found that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m47s)
00:13:47

[representations of content and style and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m48s)
00:13:48

[a CNN a separable and you can manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m50s)
00:13:50

[both create new new users is again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m52s)
00:13:52

[hopefully that now we look at that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m56s)
00:13:56

[say oh yeah that makes sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h13m58s)
00:13:58

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m05s)
00:14:05

[you can see that with papers certainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m08s)
00:14:08

[with this paper there's often quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m10s)
00:14:10

[lot of introduction that often says the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m11s)
00:14:11

[same thing about your different ways so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m14s)
00:14:14

[it's often worth you know the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m16s)
00:14:16

[you read it one paragraph might not make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m18s)
00:14:18

[sense but later on they say a different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m21s)
00:14:21

[way in it that's to make more sense so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m23s)
00:14:23

[it's worth looking through the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m25s)
00:14:25

[introductory remarks maybe two or three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m30s)
00:14:30

[um they can certainly see they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m32s)
00:14:32

[cooking talking about the different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m34s)
00:14:34

[layers and how they have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m36s)
00:14:36

[again showing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m43s)
00:14:43

[results of some experiments again you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m45s)
00:14:45

[can see if you can recreate these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m47s)
00:14:47

[experiments make sure that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m49s)
00:14:49

[understand how to do it and then there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m51s)
00:14:51

[a kind of whole lot of stuff I didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m55s)
00:14:55

[find that interesting until we get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[the section called methods so the method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h14m58s)
00:14:58

[section is the section that hopefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m00s)
00:15:00

[you'll learn the most about reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m02s)
00:15:02

[papers after you've implemented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m03s)
00:15:03

[something by reading the section called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m05s)
00:15:05

[methods now I want to show you a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m06s)
00:15:06

[little tricks if notation you did it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[be careful of little details that fly by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m13s)
00:15:13

[it like here they use average pulley as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m15s)
00:15:15

[the sentence which if you weren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m18s)
00:15:18

[reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m19s)
00:15:19

[carefully you could skip over now we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m21s)
00:15:21

[know okay we need to use average volume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m24s)
00:15:24

[on masculine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m25s)
00:15:25

[so they will often have a section which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m27s)
00:15:27

[explicitly says now I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m30s)
00:15:30

[introduce the notation and this paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m32s)
00:15:32

[doesn't then paper just type introduces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m34s)
00:15:34

[the notation as part of the discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m37s)
00:15:37

[area but at some point you'll start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m39s)
00:15:39

[getting great letters or you know things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m41s)
00:15:41

[with subscripts or whatever notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m45s)
00:15:45

[starts appearing and so at this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m46s)
00:15:46

[you need to start looking very carefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m48s)
00:15:48

[and at least for me I find I have to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m50s)
00:15:50

[back and read something many times to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m53s)
00:15:53

[remember what's l what's M what's there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m55s)
00:15:55

[okay this is the annoying thing with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h15m57s)
00:15:57

[math notation is single letters they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m00s)
00:16:00

[generally don't have any amount of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m03s)
00:16:03

[mnemonic often though you'll find that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m04s)
00:16:04

[across papers in a particular field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m07s)
00:16:07

[they'll tend to reuse the same kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m09s)
00:16:09

[English and Greek letters for the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m12s)
00:16:12

[kinds of things right so M will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m14s)
00:16:14

[generally be the number of rows capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m16s)
00:16:16

[n capital n will often be the number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m18s)
00:16:18

[columns K will often be the index that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m20s)
00:16:20

[you're summing over so on and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m25s)
00:16:25

[um so here we've got the first thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m27s)
00:16:27

[which is introduced is X with an arrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m31s)
00:16:31

[on top so X with an arrow on top meant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m34s)
00:16:34

[is the vector right it's actually an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m36s)
00:16:36

[input image but they're going to turn it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m39s)
00:16:39

[into a vector by flattening it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m41s)
00:16:41

[so okay so our image is called s and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m45s)
00:16:45

[then the CNN has a whole bunch of layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m48s)
00:16:48

[and every time you see something with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m50s)
00:16:50

[subscript or superscript like this you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m52s)
00:16:52

[need to look at both of the two bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m54s)
00:16:54

[because it goes for a meaning right the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m55s)
00:16:55

[thing the big thing is like the main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h16m58s)
00:16:58

[object so in this case a capital N is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m00s)
00:17:00

[filter and then the subscript or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m03s)
00:17:03

[superscript is like in an array or a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m05s)
00:17:05

[tensor in Python it's like the thing in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m09s)
00:17:09

[square brackets right so each filter has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m12s)
00:17:12

[a letter L which is like which number of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m15s)
00:17:15

[the filter is a and so often as I read a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m19s)
00:17:19

[paper I'll actually try to write code as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m21s)
00:17:21

[I go and like put little comments so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m24s)
00:17:24

[that are like right layer square bracket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m27s)
00:17:27

[layer number close square bracket and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m30s)
00:17:30

[have a comment after there like n yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m32s)
00:17:32

[that was to remind myself so I'm trading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m35s)
00:17:35

[the code and mapping it to the lives so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m38s)
00:17:38

[there any old filters we know from a CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m41s)
00:17:41

[that each filter creates a feature map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m43s)
00:17:43

[so that's why there are in our picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m46s)
00:17:46

[nets so remember anytime you see the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m47s)
00:17:47

[same letter it means the same D come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m49s)
00:17:49

[within a pepper not necessarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m53s)
00:17:53

[processors each fixture map is of size M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m55s)
00:17:55

[and as I mentioned before M tends to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h17m58s)
00:17:58

[rows M tends to be columns so here it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m00s)
00:18:00

[says M is the height times the width of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m04s)
00:18:04

[the feature mass so here we can see if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m08s)
00:18:08

[it is they've got plan basically to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m10s)
00:18:10

[it all one row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m13s)
00:18:13

[now this is another piece of notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m17s)
00:18:17

[you'll see all the time a layer L can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m19s)
00:18:19

[stored in a matrix called F for now the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m21s)
00:18:21

[elbow to the top doesn't matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m24s)
00:18:24

[same basic idea just an index so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m26s)
00:18:26

[matrix F is going to contain our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m30s)
00:18:30

[activations and this thing here where it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m31s)
00:18:31

[says R with a little superscript this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m34s)
00:18:34

[has a very special meaning it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m36s)
00:18:36

[referring to basically what is the shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m38s)
00:18:38

[for this so when you see this shape it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m41s)
00:18:41

[says these are our means that air flows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m44s)
00:18:44

[and this thing here means that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m47s)
00:18:47

[matrix you can see the X so means it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m50s)
00:18:50

[rose by a column so there n rows and n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m52s)
00:18:52

[columns in this matrix and every matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m55s)
00:18:55

[there's one matrix each layer and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h18m59s)
00:18:59

[there's different number of rows and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[remember columns each layer so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[basically go through and map it to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m06s)
00:19:06

[color that you're already written so I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m09s)
00:19:09

[not going to read through the whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m12s)
00:19:12

[thing but there's not very much here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m13s)
00:19:13

[being good to make sure that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m15s)
00:19:15

[understand all of us perhaps with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m17s)
00:19:17

[exception of the derivatives because we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m20s)
00:19:20

[don't care about derivatives because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m22s)
00:19:22

[they get done Boris and Sofie Arnault in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m23s)
00:19:23

[terms of flow so you can always skip the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m26s)
00:19:26

[bits about derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m29s)
00:19:29

[ok so then they do the same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[basically just writing the grand matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m37s)
00:19:37

[so they show here that the basic idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m40s)
00:19:40

[the grand matrix is that they create an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m43s)
00:19:43

[inner product between the vector eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m47s)
00:19:47

[feature map inj so vector right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m49s)
00:19:49

[means turned into a vector so the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m52s)
00:19:52

[you turn a matrix into a vector is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m55s)
00:19:55

[lambda this is the flattened inner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m56s)
00:19:56

[product between the flattened feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h19m59s)
00:19:59

[masks so those matrices we saw now so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m01s)
00:20:01

[I'll clear your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m07s)
00:20:07

[it's helpful your theater will be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m09s)
00:20:09

[small little differences so rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m11s)
00:20:11

[taking the mean they tend to use here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m16s)
00:20:16

[the sum and then they kind of divide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[that out the number of rows and columns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[to kind of create a mean this way in our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[code we actually put division inside the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m28s)
00:20:28

[sum and seriously these little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m30s)
00:20:30

[differences of how we implement things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m32s)
00:20:32

[and sometimes you may seem see actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m34s)
00:20:34

[meaningful differences and that's often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m38s)
00:20:38

[a suggestion of like others some you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m41s)
00:20:41

[need to try you know so the difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m42s)
00:20:42

[is your control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m44s)
00:20:44

[okay so let's subscribe see the notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m47s)
00:20:47

[and the method and that's it but then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m51s)
00:20:51

[very importantly is throughout this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m56s)
00:20:56

[anytime you come across some concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h20m57s)
00:20:57

[which you're not familiar with it'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m01s)
00:21:01

[pretty much always have a reference for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m04s)
00:21:04

[citation right so you'll see there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m07s)
00:21:07

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m13s)
00:21:13

[little numbers all over the place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m14s)
00:21:14

[there's lots of different ways ordering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m16s)
00:21:16

[these references but anytime you come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m18s)
00:21:18

[across something which has a citation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m21s)
00:21:21

[like it's a new piece of notation or a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m23s)
00:21:23

[new concept you don't know what it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m26s)
00:21:26

[generally the first time I see it in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m28s)
00:21:28

[paper I ignore it alright but if I keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m30s)
00:21:30

[reading and it turns out to be something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m33s)
00:21:33

[that actually is important and I can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m35s)
00:21:35

[understand the basic idea at all I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m37s)
00:21:37

[generally then put this paper aside I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m38s)
00:21:38

[put it in my to read file and make the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m41s)
00:21:41

[new paper I'm reading the thing that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m44s)
00:21:44

[floating because like very often a paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m46s)
00:21:46

[is entirely meaningless until you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m49s)
00:21:49

[read one or two of the key takers it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m51s)
00:21:51

[better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m54s)
00:21:54

[sometimes this can be like reading the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m56s)
00:21:56

[dictionary if you don't get low English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m57s)
00:21:57

[it can be like layer upon layer of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h21m58s)
00:21:58

[citations at some point you have to stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m01s)
00:22:01

[I generally thought you should I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m05s)
00:22:05

[you should find that the basic set of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m07s)
00:22:07

[papers that things refer to is pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m10s)
00:22:10

[much all stuff you guys know at this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m13s)
00:22:13

[point I don't think you're going to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m15s)

00:22:24

[don't understand let us know when other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m28s)

[was a horrible things about math is it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m30s)
00:22:30

[very how to search for you know not like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m31s)
00:22:31

[you can take that function name and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m33s)
00:22:33

[search for typing in the function names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m36s)
00:22:36

[to do some weird squiggly shape and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m37s)
00:22:37

[again feel free to up if you're not sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m40s)
00:22:40

[about there and there is a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m44s)
00:22:44

[Wikipedia page which lists I think it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m46s)
00:22:46

[just called notate our math notation or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m49s)
00:22:49

[something which lists pretty much every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m52s)
00:22:52

[piece of notation there are various](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m53s)
00:22:53

[places you can look at notation as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h22m56s)
00:22:56

[okay so that's the place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m00s)
00:23:00

[yes let's move to the next step so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m06s)
00:23:06

[think what I might do is to kind of try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m15s)
00:23:15

[and draw the basic idea of what we did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m17s)
00:23:17

[before so that I can draw the idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m20s)
00:23:20

[what we're going to do differently this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m22s)
00:23:22

[time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m23s)
00:23:23

[so previously and now this thing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m23s)
00:23:23

[actually calibrated you'll be pleased to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m25s)
00:23:25

[hear we had an a random image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m27s)
00:23:27

[and we had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m31s)
00:23:31

[a loss function doesn't matter what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m35s)
00:23:35

[loss function was right we know that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m38s)
00:23:38

[happened to be a combination of style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m40s)
00:23:40

[lofts Plus content was okay and what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m42s)
00:23:42

[did was we took our image and we're our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m46s)
00:23:46

[random image and we put it through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m51s)
00:23:51

[loss function and we got out of it two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m54s)
00:23:54

[things one was the loss and the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m56s)
00:23:56

[words the gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h23m59s)
00:23:59

[and then we use the gradients with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m02s)
00:24:02

[respect to the original pixels to change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m04s)
00:24:04

[the original pixels okay and so we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m08s)
00:24:08

[basically repeated that loop again and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m11s)
00:24:11

[again and the pixels gradually change to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m13s)
00:24:13

[make the loss go down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m16s)
00:24:16

[so that's the basic approach that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m20s)
00:24:20

[just used it's a perfectly fine approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m22s)
00:24:22

[for what it is and in fact for if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m26s)
00:24:26

[are wanting to do lots of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m28s)
00:24:28

[photos with lots of different files like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m31s)
00:24:31

[if you created a web app where you said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m35s)
00:24:35

[please upload any file image and any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m37s)

[Content image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m40s)
00:24:40

[here's your artistic style version this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m41s)
00:24:41

[is probably still the best particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m45s)
00:24:45

[with some of those tweaks I talked about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m47s)
00:24:47

[but what if you wanted to create a web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m49s)
00:24:49

[app that was a van Gogh Iris's generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m52s)
00:24:52

[upload any image and I will give you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m56s)
00:24:56

[that image in the style of their most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h24m59s)
00:24:59

[irises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m01s)
00:25:01

[you can do better than this approach and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m03s)
00:25:03

[the reason you can do better is that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m05s)
00:25:05

[can do something where you don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m07s)
00:25:07

[do a whole optimization run in order to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m09s)
00:25:09

[create that output instead we can train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m13s)
00:25:13

[a CNN to learn to output photos in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m17s)
00:25:17

[cyber band God's irises the basic idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m21s)
00:25:21

[is very similar and what we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m25s)
00:25:25

[do this time is we're going to have lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m28s)
00:25:28

[of images right and we're going to take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m31s)
00:25:31

[each image and we're going to feed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m36s)
00:25:36

[into the exact same lost function that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m38s)
00:25:38

[we use before right with a zero loss of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m42s)
00:25:42

[the content lives right but we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m46s)
00:25:46

[to use for the style loss we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m48s)
00:25:48

[use van Gogh irises and for the content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m50s)
00:25:50

[loss we're going to use the image that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h25m57s)
00:25:57

[we're currently looking at we've got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m00s)
00:26:00

[lots of images going to go through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m01s)
00:26:01

[and what we do is we're going to rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m04s)
00:26:04

[than changing the pixels of the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m07s)
00:26:07

[photo instead what we're going to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m10s)
00:26:10

[we're going to train a CNN so a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m13s)
00:26:13

[bunch of layers of a CNN we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[train a CNN to take this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m18s)
00:26:18

[the best way to choose let's move this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m23s)
00:26:23

[out of the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m26s)
00:26:26

[yeah so let's put a CNN in the middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[this is the layers of the CNN all right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m40s)
00:26:40

[and we're going to try and get that CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m42s)
00:26:42

[to spit out a new image so there's an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m45s)
00:26:45

[input image and as an output image and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m51s)
00:26:51

[this new CNN we've created is going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m56s)
00:26:56

[spit out an output image that when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h26m58s)
00:26:58

[put it through this loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m02s)
00:27:02

[hopefully it's going to give a small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m06s)
00:27:06

[number and if it is a small number it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m09s)
00:27:09

[means that the content of this photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m11s)
00:27:11

[still looks like the original photo is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m15s)
00:27:15

[content and the style of this new image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m18s)
00:27:18

[looks like a style of band off saracens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m20s)
00:27:20

[so if you think about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m23s)
00:27:23

[when you have a CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m25s)
00:27:25

[you can really take any loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m29s)
00:27:29

[you like right we objected to using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m31s)
00:27:31

[pretty simple most functions so far like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m33s)
00:27:33

[mean squared error or cross cross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m35s)
00:27:35

[entropy in this case we're going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m38s)
00:27:38

[a very different loss function which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m41s)
00:27:41

[going to be style plus content loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m43s)
00:27:43

[using the same approach that we use just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m46s)
00:27:46

[the flow okay and because that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m48s)
00:27:48

[generated by a neural net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m51s)
00:27:51

[we know it's differentiable and you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m54s)
00:27:54

[optimize any loss function as long as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h27m56s)
00:27:56

[the loss function is differentiable so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m00s)
00:28:00

[if we now basically take the gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m03s)
00:28:03

[of this output not with respect to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m05s)
00:28:05

[input image but with respect to the CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m08s)
00:28:08

[weights and we can take those gradients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m12s)
00:28:12

[and use them to update the weight to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m17s)
00:28:17

[CNN so that the next iteration through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[the CNN will be slightly better at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m22s)
00:28:22

[turning that image into a picture that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m23s)
00:28:23

[has a good sail magic with the angle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m27s)
00:28:27

[Cyrus's does that make sense so at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m28s)
00:28:28

[end of this we run this through lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m33s)
00:28:33

[images just because training a regular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m36s)
00:28:36

[CNN and the only thing we've done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m37s)
00:28:37

[differently is to replace the lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m39s)
00:28:39

[function with the style loss plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m41s)
00:28:41

[content loss and that we just use and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m43s)
00:28:43

[at the end of it we're going to have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m47s)
00:28:47

[CNN that is learnt to take any photo and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m48s)
00:28:48

[we'll fit out that photo in a style of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m51s)
00:28:51

[bangle Cyrus's and so this is a win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m54s)
00:28:54

[because it means now in your web app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m57s)
00:28:57

[which is your van Gogh irises generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h28m59s)
00:28:59

[you now don't have to run an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m02s)
00:29:02

[optimization path on the new photo you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m03s)
00:29:03

[just do a single forward pass to a CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m06s)
00:29:06

[which is instant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m08s)
00:29:08

[yes greenbox over there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m11s)
00:29:11

[and so this can limit the children see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m17s)
00:29:17

[looks ready significantly you like let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m22s)
00:29:22

[say you have Photoshop if you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m24s)
00:29:24

[change multiple styles yeah this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m26s)
00:29:26

[going to this is going to each neural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m28s)
00:29:28

[network you can learn to just one type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m30s)
00:29:30

[of side that their way of like combining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m34s)
00:29:34

[multiple styles or is it just going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m38s)
00:29:38

[be a combination you can combine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m40s)
00:29:40

[multiple sales by just like having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m42s)
00:29:42

[multiple bits of style of the multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m45s)
00:29:45

[images it's not going to have the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m48s)
00:29:48

[problems that that network has only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m49s)
00:29:49

[learned to create one kind of image it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m52s)
00:29:52

[hasn't learnt now it may be possible to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m57s)
00:29:57

[treat to Train it to the text photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h29m59s)
00:29:59

[style image and the content niche but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m02s)
00:30:02

[don't think I've seen I've done it early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m04s)
00:30:04

[on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m07s)
00:30:07

[okay it's a very version having clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m08s)
00:30:08

[that there is something simpler and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m18s)
00:30:18

[my opinion more useful we can loop which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m22s)
00:30:22

[is rather than doing style loss plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m25s)
00:30:25

[content lights let's think of another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m28s)
00:30:28

[interesting problem to solve which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m30s)
00:30:30

[called super resolution super resolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m33s)
00:30:33

[is something which honestly when Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m37s)
00:30:37

[and I started playing around with it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m41s)
00:30:41

[while ago nobody was that interested in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m42s)
00:30:42

[it but in the last year or so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m43s)
00:30:43

[become really hot yes Rachel yeah yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m46s)
00:30:46

[so we were kind of playing around at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m54s)
00:30:54

[club and what we thought it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m55s)
00:30:55

[interesting but suddenly it's got hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m56s)
00:30:56

[and the basic idea of super resolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m57s)
00:30:57

[is that you start off with a low res](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h30m59s)
00:30:59

[photo so the reason I started getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m02s)
00:31:02

[interested in this because I wanted to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m04s)
00:31:04

[help my mom take her family photos that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m05s)
00:31:05

[were often pretty low quality and blow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m08s)
00:31:08

[them up into something that was big and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m11s)
00:31:11

[high quality is you can print out so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m14s)
00:31:14

[that's what you do is you're trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m16s)
00:31:16

[take something which starts with a small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m17s)
00:31:17

[low res photo and turns it into a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m20s)
00:31:20

[high res photo LR low res H](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m24s)
00:31:24

[IRA's now perhaps you can see that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m30s)
00:31:30

[can use a very similar technique for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m34s)
00:31:34

[this what we could do is between the low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m37s)
00:31:37

[res photo and the high res photo we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m40s)
00:31:40

[could introduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m43s)
00:31:43

[at CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m47s)
00:31:47

[all right and what that say and let CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m54s)
00:31:54

[could look a lot like the CNN from our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m57s)
00:31:57

[last idea but it's taking in as input a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h31m58s)
00:31:58

[low-res for image and then it's sticking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m02s)
00:32:02

[it into a loss function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m06s)
00:32:06

[and the last function is only going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m11s)
00:32:11

[calculate content loss and the content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m12s)
00:32:12

[logic will calculate is between the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m16s)
00:32:16

[input that is brought from the low-res](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m19s)
00:32:19

[after going through the CNN compared to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m22s)
00:32:22

[the activations from the high ribbons so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m26s)
00:32:26

[in other words have CNN successfully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m29s)
00:32:29

[created a bigger photo that has the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m32s)
00:32:32

[activations as the high-res photo does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m35s)
00:32:35

[and so if we pick the right layer for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m38s)
00:32:38

[the high-res photo then that ought to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m41s)
00:32:41

[mean that we've constructed a new image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m43s)
00:32:43

[what's the ratio there's a question can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m46s)
00:32:46

[we just stick at CNN between any two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m50s)
00:32:50

[things and it will learn the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m52s)
00:32:52

[relationship yes absolutely and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m53s)
00:32:53

[one of the things I wanted to talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m56s)
00:32:56

[today is in fact I think it's at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h32m57s)
00:32:57

[start of the next paper we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m00s)
00:33:00

[look at if they even kind of talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m01s)
00:33:01

[it so this is the paper we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m04s)
00:33:04

[look at today perceptual losses for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m07s)
00:33:07

[real-time style transparency resolutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m09s)
00:33:09

[this is trim in 2016 so it took like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m11s)
00:33:11

[about a year or so to go from the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m13s)
00:33:13

[we just saw to this next stage and 0.o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m15s)
00:33:15

[maybe half year okay so what they point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m22s)
00:33:22

[out in the abstract here is that people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m27s)
00:33:27

[had done to resolution with CNN before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m28s)
00:33:28

[but previously the last function they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m31s)
00:33:31

[use to simply the mean squared error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m33s)
00:33:33

[between the pixel outputs of the scaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m35s)
00:33:35

[Network and the actual high-res image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m39s)
00:33:39

[and the problem is that it turns out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m42s)
00:33:42

[that that tends to create blurry images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m45s)
00:33:45

[and attempt to create blurring images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m48s)
00:33:48

[because the the CNN has no reason not to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m50s)
00:33:50

[create blurry images and blurry images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m55s)
00:33:55

[to actually tend to look pretty good in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m57s)
00:33:57

[the last function because as long as you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h33m59s)
00:33:59

[get the general you know oh this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m01s)
00:34:01

[probably somebody's face I'll put like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m03s)
00:34:03

[face color here and it's going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m05s)
00:34:05

[fine where else if you take the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m07s)
00:34:07

[or third comb flock of vgg then it needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m10s)
00:34:10

[to know that this is an eyeball or it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m13s)
00:34:13

[not going to look good right this no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m15s)
00:34:15

[this is the mode it's not good so if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m17s)
00:34:17

[do it not with pixel loss but with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m20s)
00:34:20

[content loss we just learnt about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m22s)
00:34:22

[you're probably going to get better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m24s)
00:34:24

[results so this like many papers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m26s)
00:34:26

[defining this paper introduces its own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m30s)
00:34:30

[language and in the language of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m33s)
00:34:33

[paper perceptual was is what they call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m36s)
00:34:36

[the main squared errors between the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m40s)
00:34:40

[activations of a network with two images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m43s)
00:34:43

[so the current thing we've been calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m46s)
00:34:46

[content was they call deception world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m48s)
00:34:48

[one of the nice things they do at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m53s)
00:34:53

[start of this and I really like it when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m54s)
00:34:54

[peppers do this is to say okay why is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m57s)
00:34:57

[this paper important well this paper is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h34m59s)
00:34:59

[important because many problems can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m01s)
00:35:01

[found at image transformation tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m03s)
00:35:03

[where a system of some input and Chuck's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m05s)

[denoising learn to take an input images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m11s)
00:35:11

00:35:20

[a high risk colorization they can import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m22s)
00:35:22

[image which is black and white and spit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m25s)

[out something is just color now one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m27s)
00:35:27

[the interesting things here is that all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m30s)
00:35:30

[of these examples you can generate as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m32s)
00:35:32

[much input data as you'd like by taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m35s)
00:35:35

[lots of images to each other from your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m39s)
00:35:39

[camera or exam load on the internet or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m40s)
00:35:40

[from internet and you can make them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m43s)
00:35:43

[lower res you can add noise you can make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m44s)
00:35:44

[them black and white right so you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m48s)
00:35:48

[generate as much level better as emotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m50s)
00:35:50

[less one of the really cool things about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m52s)
00:35:52

[this whole topic of generators vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m53s)
00:35:53

[to your left but a debt has to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h35m59s)
00:35:59

[something well with 30 people so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m06s)
00:36:06

[only the lower less imagery and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m12s)
00:36:12

[algorithmically done so just so knowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m16s)
00:36:16

[that only going to learn how to like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m19s)
00:36:19

[transfer out something is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m21s)
00:36:21

[algorithmically done versus an actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m22s)
00:36:22

[lower than the jury that doesn't act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m25s)
00:36:25

[like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m27s)
00:36:27

[yeah so one thing I'll just mention is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m29s)
00:36:29

[the way you would create your label data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m31s)
00:36:31

[is not to do that low res on the camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m34s)
00:36:34

[you would grab the images that you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m36s)
00:36:36

[already taken and make them low res just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m38s)
00:36:38

[by doing filtering you know in open CV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m41s)
00:36:41

[or whatever and yes that is algorithmic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m45s)
00:36:45

[and it may not be it may not be perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m49s)
00:36:49

[but there's lots of ways of generating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m54s)
00:36:54

[that low res image you know you can add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m55s)
00:36:55

[yes so there's lots of ways of creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m57s)
00:36:57

[a low res image so part of it is about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h36m59s)
00:36:59

[how do you do that creation of low res](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m01s)
00:37:01

[image and how well you match the real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m03s)
00:37:03

[low res data you're going to be getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m06s)
00:37:06

[then in the end in this case things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m08s)
00:37:08

[low resolution images or black-and-white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m12s)
00:37:12

[images it's so hard to start with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m14s)
00:37:14

[something that's just like it could be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m18s)
00:37:18

[like an a as seen versions with just an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m19s)
00:37:19

[8x8 picture and turning it into a photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m21s)
00:37:21

[like it's so hard to do that regardless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m25s)
00:37:25

[of how that APA thing was created that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m28s)

[often the details of Albert low res](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m31s)
00:37:31

[image was created don't really matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m35s)
00:37:35

[too much um there are some other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m36s)
00:37:36

[examples they mentioned which is turning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m40s)
00:37:40

[an image into an image which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m42s)
00:37:42

[segmentation we learn more about this in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m44s)
00:37:44

[coming lessons so the segmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m48s)
00:37:48

[refers to taking a photo of something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m50s)
00:37:50

[and creating a new image that basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m52s)
00:37:52

[has a different color for each object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m55s)
00:37:55

[clear horses a green car the blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m56s)
00:37:56

[buildings are red that's anything that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h37m59s)
00:37:59

[is called segmentation as you know from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m02s)
00:38:02

[things like the fisheries competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m04s)
00:38:04

[segmentation can be really important as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m06s)
00:38:06

[a part of solving other bigger problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m08s)
00:38:08

[another example they mention here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m11s)
00:38:11

[depth estimation there's lots of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m13s)
00:38:13

[important reasons you would want to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m15s)
00:38:15

[depth estimation for example maybe you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m17s)
00:38:17

[want to create some fancy video effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m20s)
00:38:20

[where you start with a flat photo and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m22s)
00:38:22

[you want to create some cool new Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m26s)
00:38:26

[TV thing that like moves around the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m29s)
00:38:29

[photo the parallax effect you know is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m32s)
00:38:32

[difficult ridi so if you were able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m34s)
00:38:34

[use a CNN to figure out how far away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m37s)
00:38:37

[every object was automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m40s)
00:38:40

[and you could like turn 2d photo into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m41s)
00:38:41

[3d image automatically so yeah taking an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m44s)
00:38:44

[image and sixteen image out is kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m50s)
00:38:50

[the idea in computer vision at least of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m52s)
00:38:52

[generative networks or generative models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m55s)
00:38:55

[and this is why I wanted to talk a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m56s)
00:38:56

[about generative models during this fuss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h38m59s)
00:38:59

[it's not just about artistic style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m01s)
00:39:01

[artistic style is just no sneaky way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m04s)
00:39:04

[introducing you to the world of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m07s)
00:39:07

[generative models okay so let's look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m08s)
00:39:08

[how to create this super resolution idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m15s)
00:39:15

[and your homework or part of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m19s)
00:39:19

[homework this week will be to create the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m21s)
00:39:21

[new approach to style transfer okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m26s)
00:39:26

[I'm going to build the super resolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m29s)
00:39:29

[version which is a slightly simpler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m30s)
00:39:30

[version and then you're going to try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m32s)
00:39:32

[build on top of that to create the sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m34s)
00:39:34

[transfer efficient okay so make sure you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m36s)
00:39:36

[let me know if you're not sure at any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m41s)
00:39:41

[point so I've already created a folder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m42s)
00:39:42

[of twenty thousand a sample of 20,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m47s)
00:39:47

[image net images and I've created two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m50s)
00:39:50

[sizes one is to a taper to 80 and one is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m53s)
00:39:53

[72 by 72 and they're available as a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h39m56s)
00:39:56

[hole to raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m00s)
00:40:00

[and okay so I actually posted the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m03s)
00:40:03

[to these last week and it's on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m08s)
00:40:08

[platformed on Part VI so we'll open up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m10s)
00:40:10

[those big holes arrays and one trick you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m12s)
00:40:12

[might have perfectly learnt in part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m15s)
00:40:15

[is that you can turn a big full array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m17s)
00:40:17

[into a numpy array by slicing it with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m19s)
00:40:19

[everything and so anytime you slice the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m23s)
00:40:23

[big holes array you get that numpy array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m26s)
00:40:26

[so if your slices everything and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m28s)
00:40:28

[this turns it into a non-player this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m31s)
00:40:31

[just a convenient way of sharing numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m33s)
00:40:33

[errors in this case so we've now got an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m36s)
00:40:36

[array of low resolution images and an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m39s)
00:40:39

[array of high resolution images so let](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m41s)
00:40:41

[me start start maybe by showing you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m46s)
00:40:46

[final Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m50s)
00:40:50

[okay this is the final network so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m54s)
00:40:54

[start on off by taking in a batch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h40m58s)
00:40:58

[images low res images and the very first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m01s)
00:41:01

[thing we do is stick them through a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m05s)
00:41:05

[convolutional block with a straight of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m07s)
00:41:07

[one okay this is not going to change its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m10s)
00:41:10

[size at all but a convolutional block at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m12s)
00:41:12

[the filter size of nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m14s)
00:41:14

[and it generates 64 filters so this is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m18s)
00:41:18

[very large filter size essentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m21s)
00:41:21

[nowadays filter size of 73 actually in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m24s)
00:41:24

[lot of modern networks the very first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m30s)
00:41:30

[layer is very often a large filter size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m33s)
00:41:33

[just the one just one very first layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m36s)
00:41:36

[and the reason is that it basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m39s)
00:41:39

[allows us to immediately increase the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m42s)
00:41:42

[receptive field of all of the layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m44s)
00:41:44

[renowned so by having mine by nine and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m47s)
00:41:47

[we don't lose any information because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m52s)
00:41:52

[we've gone from three channels to 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m55s)
00:41:55

[filters okay so each of these nine by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h41m58s)
00:41:58

[nine convolutions can actually have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m01s)
00:42:01

[quite a lot of information because we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m03s)
00:42:03

[got 64 filters so you'll be seeing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m04s)
00:42:04

[quite a lot in modern CNN architectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m07s)
00:42:07

[just a single large filter comes layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m11s)
00:42:11

[of this won't be unusual under the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m14s)
00:42:14

[future now the next thing out is a green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m16s)
00:42:16

[box behind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m21s)
00:42:21

[oh just a moment sir yeah describe one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m25s)
00:42:25

[of those are pretty popular pieces yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m29s)
00:42:29

[well the striped one is important for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m33s)
00:42:33

[this first layer because you don't want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m36s)
00:42:36

[to throw away any information yet right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m37s)
00:42:37

[so the very first layer we want to keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m39s)
00:42:39

[the full image size so with Austrade one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m42s)
00:42:42

[it doesn't change it doesn't down temple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m45s)
00:42:45

[at all there's also a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m47s)
00:42:47

[complication rate that in mind mr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m48s)
00:42:48

[Seidman yeah it is a big overlap a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m51s)
00:42:51

[absolutely but that's okay a a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m54s)
00:42:54

[implementation of a convolution is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h42m59s)
00:42:59

[to hopefully memorize some of that or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m02s)
00:43:02

[just keep it in cash so hopefully what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m05s)
00:43:05

[slow it down too much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m08s)
00:43:08

[one of the discussions I was just having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m10s)
00:43:10

[during the break was like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m13s)
00:43:13

[how how practical you know other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m20s)
00:43:20

[that we're learning at the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m24s)
00:43:24

[compared to like part one where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m25s)
00:43:25

[everything was just designed entirely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m27s)
00:43:27

[revealer here those practical things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m29s)
00:43:29

[which we have best practices for and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m31s)
00:43:31

[answer is like a lot of the stuff you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m34s)
00:43:34

[going to be learning no one quite knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m35s)
00:43:35

[how practical it is because a lot of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m38s)
00:43:38

[just hasn't really been around that long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m40s)
00:43:40

[and little bit under stored and move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m42s)
00:43:42

[there only great libraries for it yet so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m45s)
00:43:45

[one of the things I'm actually hoping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m47s)
00:43:47

[from this part too is by learning the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m48s)
00:43:48

[edge of research staff will be on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m53s)
00:43:53

[amongst a diverse group is that some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m55s)
00:43:55

[you will look at it and think about your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h43m59s)
00:43:59

[whatever you do nine to five or eight oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m01s)
00:44:01

[six or whatever and think oh I wonder if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m05s)
00:44:05

[I could use that for this and if that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m07s)
00:44:07

[ever pops into your head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m12s)
00:44:12

[your part and so often that's why I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m39s)
00:44:39

[want to spend some time looking at stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m42s)
00:44:42

[like this where it's like okay what are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m45s)
00:44:45

[the kinds of things this could be done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m49s)
00:44:49

[for but one of the you know I'm sure you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m51s)
00:44:51

[know in your own field like one of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m53s)
00:44:53

[differences between expert and the gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m55s)
00:44:55

[is the way an expert can look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m57s)
00:44:57

[something in first principles and say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h44m59s)
00:44:59

[okay I could use that for this totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m02s)
00:45:02

[different thing which is what nothing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m04s)
00:45:04

[do with the example that was originally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m06s)
00:45:06

[given to you because I know that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m07s)
00:45:07

[basic sets are the same and that's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m09s)
00:45:09

[I'm hoping you guys will will be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m12s)
00:45:12

[do is kind of not just say oh this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m15s)
00:45:15

[rather better it again just since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m19s)
00:45:19

[yeah it's not to say okay now I know how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m26s)
00:45:26

[to do much this ik so you know are there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m28s)
00:45:28

[things in your field which have some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m31s)
00:45:31

[similarities to so we were going to talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m34s)
00:45:34

[about on the super resolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m39s)
00:45:39

[and we talked about the idea of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m45s)

[initial cannot sew up the initial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m50s)

[complex we have the computation and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m55s)
00:45:55

[save their computation and any kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h45m59s)
00:45:59

[generative network there's like the exit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m01s)
00:46:01

[the key work it has to do which in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m04s)
00:46:04

[case is starting with a low res image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m06s)
00:46:06

[figure out like what might that blacktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m09s)
00:46:09

[be is it is an able or is it like is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m13s)
00:46:13

[wheel like it basically if you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m17s)
00:46:17

[do really good upscaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m19s)
00:46:19

[you actually have to stick it out what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m21s)
00:46:21

[the objects are so that you know what to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m24s)
00:46:24

[draw back so that's kind of like the key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m26s)
00:46:26

[computation is CNN is going to have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m29s)
00:46:29

[learn to do in generative models we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m31s)
00:46:31

[generally like to do that computation at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m35s)
00:46:35

[a low revolution and there's a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m37s)
00:46:37

[reasons why the first is that at a low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m41s)
00:46:41

[resolution is less work to do so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m43s)
00:46:43

[computation is faster but more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m45s)
00:46:45

[importantly at higher resolutions which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m47s)
00:46:47

[generally means we have a smaller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m50s)
00:46:50

[receptive field it generally means we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m53s)
00:46:53

[have less ability to kind of catch a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m55s)
00:46:55

[large amount of the image at once and if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h46m58s)
00:46:58

[you want to do really really great and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m00s)
00:47:00

[the computations where you recognize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m06s)
00:47:06

[that oh this this blob here is a face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m07s)
00:47:07

[and therefore the dot inside of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m10s)
00:47:10

[eyeball then you're going to need enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m12s)
00:47:12

[of a receptive field to cover that whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m15s)
00:47:15

[area I noticed a couple of you asked for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m18s)
00:47:18

[information about receptive fields on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m21s)
00:47:21

[the forum thread so there's some a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m23s)
00:47:23

[of information about this online so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m27s)
00:47:27

[Google is your friend here that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m29s)
00:47:29

[basic idea is if you have a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m31s)
00:47:31

[convolutional filter or 3x3 the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m33s)
00:47:33

[receptive field is 3-bedroom so it's how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m36s)
00:47:36

[much space can that convolution your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m40s)
00:47:40

[filter in sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m44s)
00:47:44

[okay so here's our 3x3 filter now on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m50s)
00:47:50

[other hand what if you had a tree by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m55s)
00:47:55

[tree filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h47m57s)
00:47:57

[which had a 3x3 filter as its input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m00s)
00:48:00

[right so that means that the center one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m04s)
00:48:04

[to call up this right but what is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m07s)
00:48:07

[one take well this one would have taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m10s)
00:48:10

[depending on the stride probably these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m12s)
00:48:12

[ones here and and this one over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m17s)
00:48:17

[will taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m20s)
00:48:20

[these ones here so in other words in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m24s)
00:48:24

[second layer assuming a strata one the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m27s)
00:48:27

[receptive field is now five by five not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m30s)
00:48:30

[three by three okay so the receptive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m35s)
00:48:35

[field depends on two things one is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m38s)
00:48:38

[many layers deep are you and secondly is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m40s)
00:48:40

[how much did the previous layers either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m43s)
00:48:43

[have a non unit stride or maybe they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m46s)
00:48:46

[have max cooling and so in some way they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m49s)
00:48:49

[were coming down sample those two things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m51s)
00:48:51

[increase the receptors here and so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m54s)
00:48:54

[reason it's great to be doing layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h48m58s)
00:48:58

[computations on a large receptive field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m01s)
00:49:01

[is that it then allows you to look at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m03s)
00:49:03

[the big picture and look at the context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m06s)
00:49:06

[not just edges anymore the eyeballs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m08s)
00:49:08

[nervous so in this case we have four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m12s)
00:49:12

[blocks of computation where each block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m18s)
00:49:18

[is a red network so for those of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m20s)
00:49:20

[that don't recall how resident works it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m24s)
00:49:24

[would be a good idea to go back to part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m27s)
00:49:27

[one and review but to remind ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m28s)
00:49:28

[let's look at the code here's a resident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m31s)
00:49:31

[one so all the red step blocks does is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m34s)
00:49:34

[checksum input and it does two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m37s)
00:49:37

[convolutional blocks on that input and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m40s)
00:49:40

[that is adds the result of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m44s)
00:49:44

[convolutions back to the original input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m47s)
00:49:47

[so you might remember can part one we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m49s)
00:49:49

[actually kind of drew it whether there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m51s)
00:49:51

[an input and it goes through two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m53s)
00:49:53

[convolutional blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m55s)
00:49:55

[and then it goes back and is added to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h49m59s)
00:49:59

[the original and if you remember we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m01s)
00:50:01

[basically said in that case we've got y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m04s)
00:50:04

[equals x plus some function of X and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m07s)
00:50:07

[which means that the function equals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m12s)
00:50:12

[why minus X and this thing here is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m19s)
00:50:19

[residual right to a whole stack of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m22s)
00:50:22

[residual blocks resident blocks on top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m25s)
00:50:25

[of each other can learn to gradually get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m27s)
00:50:27

[hone in on their whatever it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[do in this case what it's trying to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m33s)
00:50:33

[is get the information it's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m34s)
00:50:34

[need to upscale distance nowhere so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m37s)
00:50:37

[we're going to be using a lot more of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m42s)
00:50:42

[this idea of kind of taking blocks that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m45s)
00:50:45

[we know work well to something and just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m48s)
00:50:48

[reuse them and so then what about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m50s)
00:50:50

[comp lock well all the term fuck is in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m53s)
00:50:53

[this case is it's a convolution followed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m55s)
00:50:55

[by a batch norm optionally followed by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h50m59s)
00:50:59

[an activation and one of the things we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m02s)
00:51:02

[now know about resident blocks is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m05s)
00:51:05

[we generally don't want an activation at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[the end and that's one of the themes of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[the more recent taper discovered you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m14s)
00:51:14

[see that's my second home block area no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m17s)
00:51:17

[exhibition I'm sure you've noticed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m20s)
00:51:20

[throughout this course that I refactor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m23s)
00:51:23

[my network architectures a lot my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m27s)
00:51:27

[network architectures don't generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m29s)
00:51:29

[listen every single layer that they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m31s)
00:51:31

[generally functions which had a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m32s)
00:51:32

[functions is there a bunch of layers in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m35s)
00:51:35

[a lot of people don't do this it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m36s)
00:51:36

[a lot of the architecture to fine online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m40s)
00:51:40

[like hundreds of line of layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m42s)
00:51:42

[definitions I think that's crazy it's so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m45s)
00:51:45

[easy to make mistakes when you do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m47s)
00:51:47

[that way and so how to really see what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m49s)
00:51:49

[going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m51s)
00:51:51

[so if you know in general I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m52s)
00:51:52

[strongly recommend if you try to read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m54s)
00:51:54

[back to your architectures so that by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m55s)
00:51:55

[the time you write the final thing it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h51m58s)
00:51:58

[you don't pop the page and you'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m00s)
00:52:00

[plenty of examples of that so we though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m04s)
00:52:04

[that'll be awful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m06s)
00:52:06

[all right so we've increased the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m08s)
00:52:08

[receptive field we've done a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m10s)
00:52:10

[computation but we still haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m12s)
00:52:12

[actually changed the size of the image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m14s)
00:52:14

[which is not very helpful so the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m16s)
00:52:16

[thing we do is going to change the size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m19s)
00:52:19

[of the image and the first thing we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m20s)
00:52:20

[going to learn is to do that with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m23s)
00:52:23

[something that goes by many names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m25s)
00:52:25

[some what is deconvolution another is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m34s)
00:52:34

[and it's also known as transposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m37s)
00:52:37

[convolutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m41s)
00:52:41

[and it's also known as fractionally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m44s)
00:52:44

[strided convolutions in carrots they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m48s)
00:52:48

[call the deconvolution and the basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h52m55s)
00:52:55

[idea is something which I've actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m00s)
00:53:00

[got a spreadsheet to show you okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m04s)
00:53:04

[here's pitch here's a spreadsheet the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m08s)
00:53:08

[basic idea is that you've got some kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m12s)
00:53:12

[of initially here's a four by four image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m15s)
00:53:15

[for whiteboard area all right and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m17s)
00:53:17

[put it through the 3x3 filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m20s)
00:53:20

[convolutional filter and if you're doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m22s)
00:53:22

[valid convolutions and that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m26s)
00:53:26

[leave you with a 2x2 output because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m30s)
00:53:30

[here's one 3x3 another 3x3 practical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m33s)
00:53:33

[four of them and so each one is having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m37s)
00:53:37

[the whole filter and the appropriate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m44s)
00:53:44

[part of the data is just a standard 2d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m45s)
00:53:45

[accomplished so we've done that now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m48s)
00:53:48

[let's say we want to undo that right we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m50s)
00:53:50

[want something which can take this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m54s)
00:53:54

[result and recreate this input how would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h53m55s)
00:53:55

[you do that so one way to do that would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m01s)
00:54:01

[be to take this result and so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m04s)
00:54:04

[popular here right and put back that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m07s)
00:54:07

[implicit padding so it's surrounded with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m11s)
00:54:11

[all these zeros such that now if we use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m15s)
00:54:15

[let's have some filter would have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m22s)
00:54:22

[started at zero and we have some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m24s)
00:54:24

[convolutional filter okay and we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m27s)
00:54:27

[going to put it through this entire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m31s)
00:54:31

[matrix a bunch of zeros with our result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m33s)
00:54:33

[metrics in the middle and then we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m37s)
00:54:37

[calculate our results in exactly the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m40s)
00:54:40

[same way just a normal conversational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m42s)
00:54:42

[gutter so if we now use gradient descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m44s)
00:54:44

[we can look at and see okay what is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m48s)
00:54:48

[error right so how much does this pixel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m51s)
00:54:51

[differ from this stencil and how much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m55s)
00:54:55

[says this pixel difference in this pixel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h54m58s)
00:54:58

[and let me add them all together to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m01s)
00:55:01

[our mean square error so we can now use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m03s)
00:55:03

[gradient descent let's check to your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m07s)
00:55:07

[nutrition pipeline in excel is called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m10s)
00:55:10

[solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m11s)
00:55:11

[and we can say okay set this cell to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m13s)
00:55:13

[minimum by changing these cells okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m18s)
00:55:18

[this is basically like the simplest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m23s)
00:55:23

[possible optimization fold that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m24s)
00:55:24

[and here's what it's carpet right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m31s)
00:55:31

[it's come up with a convolutional filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m33s)
00:55:33

[you'll see that the result is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m37s)
00:55:37

[exactly the same as the original data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m40s)
00:55:40

[and of course how could it be right we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m42s)
00:55:42

[don't have enough information we only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m45s)
00:55:45

[have four things that try and regenerate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m46s)
00:55:46

[16 things but it's not terrible and in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m49s)
00:55:49

[general this is this is a challenge with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m53s)
00:55:53

[upscale right when you've got them in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m56s)
00:55:56

[this forward and down sampled if you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h55m58s)
00:55:58

[thrown away information I said any way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m01s)
00:56:01

[you can get information back is to guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m03s)
00:56:03

[what was there but the important thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m05s)
00:56:05

[is that by using a convolution like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m08s)
00:56:08

[we can learn those filters so we can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m10s)
00:56:10

[learn how to up sample it in a way that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m15s)
00:56:15

[gives us the loss that we want so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m17s)
00:56:17

[is what a deconvolution is it's just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m20s)
00:56:20

[convolution on a padded input now in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m22s)
00:56:22

[this case I've assumed that my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m28s)
00:56:28

[convolutions had a unit straight it was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m30s)
00:56:30

[just one pixel the cleaning solution if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m34s)
00:56:34

[your convolutions are straight to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m37s)
00:56:37

[it looks like this picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m42s)
00:56:42

[okay and you can see that as well as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m45s)
00:56:45

[putting the two pixels around the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m46s)
00:56:46

[outside we've also put a zero pixel in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m48s)
00:56:48

[the middle that so these four cells is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m53s)
00:56:53

[now our data cells and you can see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m56s)
00:56:56

[calculating convolution through here as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h56m58s)
00:56:58

[John we suggest looking at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m02s)
00:57:02

[which is where this picture comes from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m04s)
00:57:04

[and in turn this link comes from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m06s)
00:57:06

[fantastic paper called the convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m11s)

[paper and so if you want to know more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m16s)
00:57:16

[about both convolutions and D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m18s)
00:57:18

[convolutions you can look at this page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m19s)
00:57:19

[and it's got lots of beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m22s)

[animations including animations on they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m24s)
00:57:24

[call a transpose revolutions and so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m29s)
00:57:29

[can see there we go this is the one I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m33s)
00:57:33

[just showed you all right so I want you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m40s)
00:57:40

[to saw in Excel ton so that's a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m41s)
00:57:41

[really great flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m45s)
00:57:45

[okay so that's what we're going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m52s)
00:57:52

[first is we're going to do D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m54s)
00:57:54

[convolutions so in Kara a deconvolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h57m58s)
00:57:58

[is exactly the same as convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m02s)
00:58:02

[except with te on the front but all the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m04s)
00:58:04

[same stuff how many filters to one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m07s)
00:58:07

[what's the size of your filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m08s)
00:58:08

[what's your stride or subsample as they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m11s)
00:58:11

[call it on auto mode circles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m14s)
00:58:14

[the question is tensor flows the back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m18s)
00:58:18

[end shouldn't Sebastian normalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m20s)

[affects access minus one is the default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m44s)

[also responsible for some of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m56s)
00:58:56

[beautiful pictures you saw earlier as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m58s)
00:58:58

[was interested again let's remove this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h58m59s)
00:58:59

[that way fucking look at that and go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m09s)
00:59:09

[faster as well so just in case you went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m13s)
00:59:13

[clear on that you might remember from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m16s)
00:59:16

[part one that we reason we have that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m18s)
00:59:18

[access equals one is because Indiana doe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m20s)
00:59:20

[the channel axis so we basically wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m22s)
00:59:22

[not to throw away the XY information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m25s)
00:59:25

[that National Lacrosse had in piano and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m28s)
00:59:28

[channel will never last answers and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m31s)
00:59:31

[since have minus one is the default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m33s)
00:59:33

[should I visit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m36s)
00:59:36

[um okay so that's therapy completion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m41s)
00:59:41

[blocks and so we're using a strive of 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m45s)
00:59:45

[comma 2 alright so that means that each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m52s)
00:59:52

[time you go through this C convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m54s)
00:59:54

[it's going to be doubling the size of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m55s)
00:59:55

[the image for some reason I don't fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=00h59m57s)
00:59:57

[understand and haven't really looked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m00s)
01:00:00

[into in care ups you actually have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m01s)
01:00:01

[tell it the shape of the output so you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m03s)
01:00:03

[can see here I've actually SH you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m07s)
01:00:07

[actually see but from 72 by 72 to 144 by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m08s)
01:00:08

[144 to 288 283 assess learning to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m12s)
01:00:12

[upscale and it's not upscaling there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m19s)
01:00:19

[just three channels it's subsiding with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m22s)
01:00:22

[64 filters so that's how can a parent do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m24s)
01:00:24

[what is Chester and then finally we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m27s)
01:00:27

[we're kind of reversing things here we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m33s)
01:00:33

[have another treat like another 9 by 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m35s)
01:00:35

[convolution in order to get back to our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m38s)
01:00:38

[3 channels so the idea is we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m41s)
01:00:41

[previously have something with 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m44s)
01:00:44

[channels and so we now wanted to invent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m46s)
01:00:46

[something there's three channels for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m49s)
01:00:49

[three pallets and to do that we want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m51s)
01:00:51

[use quite a bit of context so we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m53s)
01:00:53

[nine by nine single one by nine filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m55s)
01:00:55

[at the end to get our three shelter so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h00m58s)
01:00:58

[at the end we have a 288 by 288 5 310 in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m00s)
01:01:00

[other words an image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m05s)
01:01:05

[so if we go ahead now and train this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m08s)
01:01:08

[then it's going to do basically what we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m10s)
01:01:10

[want so the thing we're going to do is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m13s)
01:01:13

[to create our last match okay and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m15s)
01:01:15

[creating our loss function is a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m17s)
01:01:17

[bit messy but I'll take you to it slowly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m23s)
01:01:23

[and her fever will make sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m26s)
01:01:26

[so we've taken distance remember some of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m32s)
01:01:32

[the symbols here input F is the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m35s)
01:01:35

[low resolution input gesture and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m40s)
01:01:40

[the output of this is called a pin at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m44s)
01:01:44

[work and so let's call this whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m48s)
01:01:48

[network here but followed the up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m50s)
01:01:50

[sampling network and so this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m52s)
01:01:52

[thing that's actually responsible doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m54s)
01:01:54

[the answer so we're going to take the up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m56s)
01:01:56

[sensing network and we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h01m58s)
01:01:58

[attach it to the GG and the V but V G G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m00s)
01:02:00

[is going to be used only as a loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m04s)
01:02:04

[function and get the content once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m06s)
01:02:06

[so before we can check this output and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m11s)
01:02:11

[stick it into BCG we need to stick it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m13s)
01:02:13

[through our standard means of traction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m16s)
01:02:16

[pre-processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m18s)
01:02:18

[so this is just the same thing that we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m19s)
01:02:19

[did over and over again in part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m21s)
01:02:21

[so let's now define and this output as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m24s)
01:02:24

[being this lambda functions applied to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m30s)
01:02:30

[the 1/2 foot around upsampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m33s)
01:02:33

[Network okay so that's what this is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m36s)
01:02:36

[is just our pre-processed up sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m39s)
01:02:39

[network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m42s)
01:02:42

[so we can now create a vtg Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m46s)
01:02:46

[and let's go through every layer and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m52s)
01:02:52

[make it not tradable okay like you can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m54s)
01:02:54

[ever make your loss function between all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h02m57s)
01:02:57

[a lot function is fixed in stone thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m00s)
01:03:00

[that tells you how well you do so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m03s)
01:03:03

[clearly you have to make sure each GG is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m05s)
01:03:05

[not fair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m07s)
01:03:07

[all right now which bidders on the VG G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m09s)
01:03:09

[network we want we can try a few things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m12s)
01:03:12

[I'm using block to con - ok so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m14s)
01:03:14

[relatively early and the reason for that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m18s)
01:03:18

[is that if you remember when we did the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m20s)
01:03:20

[content reconstruction last week the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m22s)
01:03:22

[very first thing we did we found that if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m26s)
01:03:26

[you you could basically totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m27s)
01:03:27

[reconstruct the original image from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m29s)
01:03:29

[early layer activations where else by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m31s)
01:03:31

[the time reversal layer for a so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m34s)
01:03:34

[blocked for we've got pretty horrendous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m36s)
01:03:36

[things right so we're going to use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m39s)
01:03:39

[somewhat early block as our content loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m41s)
01:03:41

[or if the paper calls it the perceptual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m46s)
01:03:46

[loss and you can play around this see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m49s)
01:03:49

[how it goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m52s)
01:03:52

[correct so now we're going to create two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m55s)
01:03:55

[versions of this dgg output and this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h03m58s)
01:03:58

[something which is I think very poorly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m03s)
01:04:03

[understood or appreciated with the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m07s)
01:04:07

[carats of functional API which is any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m09s)
01:04:09

[kind of layer and the model is a layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m12s)
01:04:12

[far as characters concerned can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m15s)
01:04:15

[treated as if as a function right so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m17s)
01:04:17

[can take this model and pretend it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m20s)
01:04:20

[function and we can't answer any chance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m23s)
01:04:23

[that we like and what that does is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m26s)
01:04:26

[creates a new model where those two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m28s)
01:04:28

[pieces is joining together okay so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m31s)
01:04:31

[gg2 is now equal to this model on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m35s)
01:04:35

[top and lift model on the boat and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m42s)
01:04:42

[remember this model was the result of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m47s)
01:04:47

[our up sampling network ID by P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m49s)
01:04:49

[president and the up sampling network is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m52s)
01:04:52

[the lambda function to normalize the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m57s)
01:04:57

[output image yeah that's a good point so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h04m59s)
01:04:59

[we use a and activation which can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m02s)
01:05:02

[negative 1 to 1 so if you then go that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m06s)
01:05:06

[plus 1 times 1 2015 1 half that gives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m10s)
01:05:10

[you something that's between naught into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m12s)
01:05:12

[T to 5 which is the range that we want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m14s)
01:05:14

[interestingly this was suggested in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m17s)
01:05:17

[original paper and such initial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m20s)
01:05:20

[materials and more recently in rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m21s)
01:05:21

[than I think it was the author said that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m24s)
01:05:24

[they tried it without puts an activation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m26s)
01:05:26

[and therefore without the final key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m29s)
01:05:29

[processing and it worked just as well so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m33s)
01:05:33

[you can try doing that in order to try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m36s)
01:05:36

[it you just remove the activation and to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m38s)
01:05:38

[distribute this last thing inside but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m42s)
01:05:42

[obviously if you do you have a fan and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m46s)
01:05:46

[you need the output and this is actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m47s)
01:05:47

[something I've been saying with a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m51s)
01:05:51

[different models any time I have some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m53s)
01:05:53

[particular range that I want and when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m56s)
01:05:56

[way to enforce that is by having a fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h05m59s)
01:05:59

[or sigmoid followed by something that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m02s)
01:06:02

[turns out easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m04s)
01:06:04

[she won not just images okay so we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m05s)
01:06:05

[got two versions of our vtg layer output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m13s)
01:06:13

[one which is based on the output of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m16s)
01:06:16

[optical network and the other which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m20s)
01:06:20

[based on just an employee right and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m23s)
01:06:23

[just an input is using the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m28s)
01:06:28

[high-resolution ship input okay so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m29s)
01:06:29

[makes sense because this PGG network is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m35s)
01:06:35

[something that we're going to be using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m39s)
01:06:39

[at the high resolution scale we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m41s)
01:06:41

[to be taking the high resolution target](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m43s)
01:06:43

[image and high resolution up sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m46s)
01:06:46

[results and compare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m48s)
01:06:48

[now that we some of that we're nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m53s)
01:06:53

[there we've now got the high res to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h06m54s)
01:06:54

[sexual activations and we've got the low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m00s)
01:07:00

[res upsampled perceptual activations we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m04s)
01:07:04

[now just need to check the mean sum of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m07s)
01:07:07

[squares between them and here it is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m09s)
01:07:09

[Sin Cara anytime you put something into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m14s)
01:07:14

[a network that hasn't seen a layer so if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m16s)
01:07:16

[you want to take it just a plain old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m19s)
01:07:19

[function and turn it into a layer you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m21s)
01:07:21

[just chuck it inside a locker there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m23s)
01:07:23

[capital and that's all that form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m25s)
01:07:25

[so our final model is going to check our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m28s)
01:07:28

[up simple input and our sorry our low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32

[res input and our high res input is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m36s)
01:07:36

[actually input and return this loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m39s)
01:07:39

[function and Apple okay one last trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m41s)
01:07:41

[when you fit things in Care Act's it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m46s)
01:07:46

[assumes that you're trying to take some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m50s)
01:07:50

[output and make it close to some target](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m52s)
01:07:52

[in this case our loss is the actual loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m55s)
01:07:55

[function we want it's not there's some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h07m59s)
01:07:59

[target correct we want to make it as low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m01s)
01:08:01

[as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m03s)
01:08:03

[and since it's a sum of squared errors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m04s)
01:08:04

[for a mean square error actually it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m07s)
01:08:07

[can't go beneath zero so what we can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m10s)
01:08:10

[is we can basically check care UPS and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m13s)
01:08:13

[say that our target for the loss is zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m15s)
01:08:15

[and you can't just use the scalar 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m18s)
01:08:18

[remember every time we have a target set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m21s)
01:08:21

[of labels in care you need one to every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m24s)
01:08:24

[row rightly one for every input so we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m26s)
01:08:26

[going to create an array of zeros okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m29s)
01:08:29

[so that's that's just so that we can fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m33s)
01:08:33

[it into a chaotic set and I kind of find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m36s)
01:08:36

[that increasingly as I start to move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m39s)
01:08:39

[away from the kind of you know the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m41s)
01:08:41

[trodden path of deep learning more and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m47s)
01:08:47

[more ticket if you want to use care us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m49s)
01:08:49

[you kind of have to do weird little acts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m51s)
01:08:51

[the Soviet is a relative there I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m55s)
01:08:55

[probably more elegant ways of doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h08m58s)
01:08:58

[but this works so we've got our love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m00s)
01:09:00

[function that we're trying to get every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m03s)
01:09:03

[row is close to zero possible we have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m05s)
01:09:05

[question for only using up to block to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m09s)
01:09:09

[cons to could we pop off all the layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m12s)
01:09:12

[afterwards to say complication sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m15s)
01:09:15

[wouldn't be ahead of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m18s)
01:09:18

[okay so we compile it we fit it and one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m21s)
01:09:21

[thing you'll notice I started doing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m26s)
01:09:26

[using understeer this callback called TQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m28s)
01:09:28

[DM notebook call back empty QT m is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m38s)
01:09:38

[really terrific loading and basically it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m42s)
01:09:42

[does something very very simple which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m45s)
01:09:45

[to add a here at a progress meter to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m48s)
01:09:48

[your loops you can use it in console as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m51s)
01:09:51

[you can see and so basically anywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m56s)
01:09:56

[you're going to looking at t QT m around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h09m58s)
01:09:58

[it okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m00s)
01:10:00

[and that loops does just what it used to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m01s)
01:10:01

[but it gets progressive and it even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m04s)
01:10:04

[guesses you know how much time is left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m07s)
01:10:07

[in circles you can also use it inside a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m09s)
01:10:09

[gym in a notebook and it creates a neat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m12s)
01:10:12

[little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m16s)
01:10:16

[neat little grant eventually goes up and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m21s)
01:10:21

[shows you how long left and so forth so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m24s)
01:10:24

[this is just a nice little trick you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m25s)
01:10:25

[some learning ready kneeling and at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m29s)
01:10:29

[end of training it for a few he talks we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m34s)
01:10:34

[can try out a model now the model we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m38s)
01:10:38

[interested in is just the up sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m41s)
01:10:41

[model right they're going to be feeding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m43s)
01:10:43

[the up sampling model loaded inputs and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m44s)
01:10:44

[getting out the high-res applets we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m47s)
01:10:47

[don't actually go to care about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m49s)
01:10:49

[value of the Lots so I'll now define a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m51s)
01:10:51

[model which takes its input the lower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m54s)
01:10:54

[the input and spits out as output now I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m56s)
01:10:56

[remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h10m59s)
01:10:59

[so with that model we can trace call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m02s)
01:11:02

[predicts so here is our original low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m05s)
01:11:05

[resolution mashed potato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m09s)
01:11:09

[and here's a high-resolution editor and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m14s)
01:11:14

[it's it's amazing what it's done like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m16s)
01:11:16

[you can see in the original like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m19s)
01:11:19

[shadow of the laces are in clear the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m23s)
01:11:23

[kind of the beats in the mashed potato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m26s)
01:11:26

[which is kind of big blobs in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m28s)
01:11:28

[version we had like their shadows hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m31s)
01:11:31

[edges and so forth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m34s)
01:11:34

[question can you explain the size of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m39s)
01:11:39

[target it's the first dimension of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m42s)
01:11:42

[high-rez times 128 why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m44s)
01:11:44

[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m53s)
01:11:53

[yes okay so let's see it's this number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h11m58s)
01:11:58

[so this is the particular number images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m02s)
01:12:02

[that we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m04s)
01:12:04

[ah and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m07s)
01:12:07

[it's fun pays oh it's 128 because that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m12s)
01:12:12

[layer has 128 filters so this ends up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m19s)
01:12:19

[giving you the mean square error of 128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m23s)
01:12:23

[mm well since Isis yes there is another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m30s)
01:12:30

[question but popping the unused layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m39s)
01:12:39

[really save anything aren't you only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m41s)
01:12:41

[getting the layers you want when you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m43s)
01:12:43

[the BG layer block to cons - yeah I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m46s)
01:12:46

[not sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m50s)
01:12:50

[I don't have a can't quite see quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m53s)
01:12:53

[enough you can try it the bundle and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h12m56s)
01:12:56

[intuitively what features is this model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m00s)
01:13:00

[learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m03s)
01:13:03

[but what it's learning is looking at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m05s)
01:13:05

[20,000 images very very very low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m08s)

01:13:22

[probably a shadow and when there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m23s)

[shadow sort of share example it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m25s)
01:13:25

[learning that when there's a curve it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m28s)
01:13:28

[doesn't actually need to look like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m31s)

[world looks like you know and then when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m40s)
01:13:40

[you take that well and blur it and make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m43s)
01:13:43

[it small you know what does it then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m47s)
01:13:47

[replace and so it's just like when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m49s)
01:13:49

[when you look at a picture like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h13m51s)

[your brain basically is doing the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m02s)
01:14:02

[thing it's like when you read a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m04s)

[you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m11s)
01:14:11

[so are you suggesting there is a similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m18s)
01:14:18

[universality on the other way around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m21s)
01:14:21

[like you know when vgg saying the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m24s)
01:14:24

[layers are learning a line and then a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m26s)
01:14:26

[square then those are I are you saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m28s)
01:14:28

[the same thing is true in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m32s)
01:14:32

[yeah absolutely it's an SP when it is no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m34s)
01:14:34

[way to sample all right this is in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m39s)
01:14:39

[number of ways lots of information so in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h14m44s)

[intuitively thinking about it like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h15m00s)

[doing any as well if we want to see as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h15m53s)
01:15:53

[well as a version sweetly I'm just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h15m55s)
01:15:55

[very expensive object it just has a high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h15m59s)
01:15:59

[for me to imagine mashed potatoes and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m04s)
01:16:04

[face kind of like in the same category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m06s)
01:16:06

[that's fine yeah the biggest the big key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[thing to realize is there's nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m11s)
01:16:11

[policy really different between what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m12s)
01:16:12

[necessary looks like a one-person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m15s)
01:16:15

[software so you know something to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m17s)
01:16:17

[to recognize the image teaches is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m20s)
01:16:20

[necessary and so in a big enough network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m24s)
01:16:24

[sharing a lot example simpler not just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m27s)
01:16:27

[national photo but writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m30s)
01:16:30

[and the pictures and so you know for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m32s)
01:16:32

[your examples you'll most likely be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m36s)
01:16:36

[doing thought this is modernized Pacific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m39s)
01:16:39

[and so you should use North American if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m41s)
01:16:41

[data the advantages that you know these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m43s)
01:16:43

[permissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m46s)
01:16:46

[questioner shit okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h16m50s)
01:16:50

[one thing I mentioned here is I haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m02s)
01:17:02

[used to test set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m04s)
01:17:04

[so another piece of the homework is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m06s)
01:17:06

[add a note out there right and and tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m08s)
01:17:08

[us it's this mashed-potato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m12s)
01:17:12

[overfit okay this is actually just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m15s)
01:17:15

[matching the particular training set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[version of this mashed potato or not and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[if it is a de fitting can you can you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m24s)
01:17:24

[create something just doesn't have it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m27s)
01:17:27

[so there's another piece of homework so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m30s)
01:17:30

[I'm it's very simple now to take this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m33s)
01:17:33

[and turn it into our past style transfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m37s)
01:17:37

[so our style transfer is going to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m42s)
01:17:42

[exactly the same thing that rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m44s)
01:17:44

[taking something turning something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m47s)
01:17:47

[low-res into something high res it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m49s)
01:17:49

[going to take something that's a photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m51s)
01:17:51

[and send it into standoff Cyrus's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h17m54s)
01:17:54

[so we're going to do that in just the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m01s)
01:18:01

[same way we're going to rather than go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m03s)
01:18:03

[from low res through a CNN to find the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m06s)
01:18:06

[content loss against high res we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m11s)
01:18:11

[going to take a photo go through a CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m14s)
01:18:14

[and do both sigh Oh lots and content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m18s)
01:18:18

[lots against a single text sale image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m21s)
01:18:21

[I've given you links here so I have not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m26s)
01:18:26

[implemented this for you this is see you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m29s)
01:18:29

[to implement but I have given you links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m31s)
01:18:31

[to the original paper and very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m33s)
01:18:33

[importantly also to the supplementary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m34s)
01:18:34

[material to the little hard to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m36s)
01:18:36

[because it's two different versions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m39s)
01:18:39

[only one of them is correct and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m40s)
01:18:40

[profitable industry so the supplementary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m42s)
01:18:42

[material goes through all of the exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m47s)
01:18:47

[details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m50s)
01:18:50

[what was their last function what was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m52s)
01:18:52

[their processing or service architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m55s)
01:18:55

[and so on and so forth so while I wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h18m57s)
01:18:57

[for this load yeah like we did a doodle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m01s)
01:19:01

[regeneration using the models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m08s)
01:19:08

[photographers wait could we create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m10s)
01:19:10

[regular image to see how you would look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m14s)
01:19:14

[if you were a model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m16s)
01:19:16

[I know I learn exact like it if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m18s)
01:19:18

[could come up with a lot function which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m24s)
01:19:24

[is how much to somebody look like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m26s)
01:19:26

[model you could so you have to turn up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m27s)
01:19:27

[the last match and it has to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m30s)
01:19:30

[something where you can generate labeled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m34s)
01:19:34

[data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m36s)
01:19:36

[one of the things they mentioned in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m39s)
01:19:39

[paper is that they found it very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m41s)
01:19:41

[important to add quite a lot of padding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m43s)
01:19:43

[and specifically they didn't add zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m47s)
01:19:47

[padding in a normal area to set a black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m49s)
01:19:49

[border but they add reflection padding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m51s)
01:19:51

[so reflection padding literally means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m53s)
01:19:53

[take the edge and reflective reoccurring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h19m56s)
01:19:56

[I've written it for you because there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m00s)
01:20:00

[isn't one but you may find it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m03s)
01:20:03

[interesting to look at this because this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m05s)
01:20:05

[is like one of the simplest examples of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m07s)
01:20:07

[a custom layer okay so we're going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m09s)
01:20:09

[using custom layers more and more and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m12s)
01:20:12

[I don't want you to be afraid of them so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m15s)
01:20:15

[a custom layer in carrots is a Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m17s)
01:20:17

[class so if you haven't done that as I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m20s)
01:20:20

[mentioned before for the class palette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m22s)
01:20:22

[if you haven't done our programming in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m24s)
01:20:24

[Python now's a good time to go and look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m26s)
01:20:26

[at some tutorials because you're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m28s)
01:20:28

[to be doing quite a lot of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m29s)
01:20:29

[particularly the pipes pipes words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m31s)
01:20:31

[absolutely alive in them so we're going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m33s)
01:20:33

[to create a class it has to inherit from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m35s)
01:20:35

[layer in Python this is how you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m38s)
01:20:38

[create a constructor pythons our syntax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m42s)
01:20:42

[is really gross you have to use a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m45s)
01:20:45

[special weird custom new thing which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m48s)
01:20:48

[happens to be the projector every single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m50s)
01:20:50

[damn thing inside of class you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m53s)
01:20:53

[manually type out so color is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m55s)
01:20:55

[parameter if you forget you'll get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m57s)
01:20:57

[stupid errors sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h20m59s)
01:20:59

[and then in the constructor for a layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m03s)
01:21:03

[this is basically where you just save](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m05s)
01:21:05

[away any of the information you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m08s)
01:21:08

[doing so in this case you need you since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m09s)
01:21:09

[I want this much padding so you just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m11s)
01:21:11

[have to save that somewhere I say only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m13s)
01:21:13

[this much time and then you need to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m15s)
01:21:15

[two things in every class custom layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m18s)
01:21:18

[one is you have to define something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m21s)
01:21:21

[called get output check for that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m23s)
01:21:23

[going to pass in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m27s)
01:21:27

[the shape of an input and you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m29s)
01:21:29

[return what is the shape of the outputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m32s)
01:21:32

[that that would create so in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m34s)
01:21:34

[if f is the shape of the input then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m36s)
01:21:36

[output is going to be the same batch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m40s)
01:21:40

[size and the same number of channels and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m41s)
01:21:41

[then we're going to add in twice the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m45s)
01:21:45

[amount of padding both the rows and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m47s)
01:21:47

[columns but this is going to tell it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m50s)
01:21:50

[because remember when we pull things out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m52s)
01:21:52

[corrupt is like you just check the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m54s)
01:21:54

[layers on top of each other and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m56s)
01:21:56

[magically knows how big or the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h21m58s)
01:21:58

[intermediate things are it magically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m00s)
01:22:00

[knows because every layer has this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m02s)
01:22:02

[designed that's how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m04s)
01:22:04

[the second thing you have to define is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m07s)
01:22:07

[an import call and follow the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m09s)
01:22:09

[which will get your layer data and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m12s)
01:22:12

[have to return whatever your layer does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m15s)
01:22:15

[right in our case we want to call caused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m18s)
01:22:18

[it to add reflection padding and in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m23s)
01:22:23

[case so happens the tensor flow has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m26s)
01:22:26

[something built in to that called TSN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m28s)
01:22:28

[obviously generally it's nice to create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m32s)
01:22:32

[chaos layers that would work with both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m35s)
01:22:35

[piano and tensorflow beckons by using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m37s)
01:22:37

[that capital K dot notation but in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m40s)
01:22:40

[case piano didn't have anything obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m43s)
01:22:43

[that it is easily and since it's just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m46s)
01:22:46

[through our class I just decided just to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m48s)
01:22:48

[make a test phone okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m50s)
01:22:50

[so here is a complete layer I can now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m53s)
01:22:53

[use that layer in a network definition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h22m57s)
01:22:57

[like this I can call drop predict which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m00s)
01:23:00

[will take an input and turn it into you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m04s)
01:23:04

[consider the bird now has the left and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m07s)
01:23:07

[right sides here being reflected okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m11s)
01:23:11

[that is there for you to use because in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m16s)
01:23:16

[the supplementary material for the paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m20s)
01:23:20

[they add that they add spatial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m23s)
01:23:23

[reflection padding the beginning of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m26s)
01:23:26

[network and they add a lot 45 40 and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m28s)
01:23:28

[reason they add a lot is because they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m33s)
01:23:33

[mentioned the supplementary material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m35s)
01:23:35

[that they don't want to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m37s)
01:23:37

[same convolutions they want to use valid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m43s)
01:23:43

[convolutions in their computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m45s)
01:23:45

[because if you add any black borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m47s)
01:23:47

[during those computation steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m49s)
01:23:49

[it creates weird artifacts on the edges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m51s)
01:23:51

[of the images so you'll see that through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m54s)
01:23:54

[this computation for their residual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m57s)
01:23:57

[blocks the size get smaller by for each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h23m58s)
01:23:58

[time and that's because these are valid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m02s)
01:24:02

[convolutions so that's why they have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m05s)
01:24:05

[add padding to the stat so that these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m07s)
01:24:07

[sets are called the image to come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m11s)
01:24:11

[through small](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m13s)
01:24:13

[so this section here should look very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m15s)
01:24:15

[familiar because it's the same as our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m18s)
01:24:18

[absently Network a bunch of residual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m22s)
01:24:22

[blocks 2d convolutions and one nine by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m24s)
01:24:24

[nine convolution and so this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m29s)
01:24:29

[identical there you can copy this is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m31s)
01:24:31

[nib it okay and so why do we have we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m36s)
01:24:36

[already talked about why we have this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m42s)
01:24:42

[line by line con but why do we have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m43s)
01:24:43

[these downsampling convolutions to start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m45s)
01:24:45

[with we start with an image up here of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m49s)
01:24:49

[three three six five three three six and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m51s)
01:24:51

[we have its size and then we have its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m53s)
01:24:53

[size again why do we do that like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h24m56s)
01:24:56

[reason we do that is that as I mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m02s)
01:25:02

[earlier we want to do our computation at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m05s)
01:25:05

[a lower resolution because it allows us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m09s)
01:25:09

[to have a larger receptive field and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m12s)
01:25:12

[allows us to do less computation so this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m14s)
01:25:14

[is Katun where it's like reflective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m18s)
01:25:18

[right like the last thing is the same as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m23s)
01:25:23

[the set the top thing second one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m26s)
01:25:26

[and the second thing you can see it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m28s)
01:25:28

[like a reflection to make sure it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m30s)
01:25:30

[really really common in generative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m33s)
01:25:33

[models its first of all to take your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m34s)
01:25:34

[object down sample it increasing the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m36s)
01:25:36

[number of channels at the same time so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m40s)
01:25:40

[increasing the receptive field you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m42s)
01:25:42

[creating more and more complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m44s)
01:25:44

[representations you then do a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m45s)
01:25:45

[computation on those representations and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m47s)
01:25:47

[then at the end you're up sampling in so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m50s)
01:25:50

[you're going to see this pattern also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m52s)
01:25:52

[and so that's why I wanted you guys to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m54s)
01:25:54

[implement this yourself okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h25m57s)
01:25:57

[so there's that all right the last major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m01s)
01:26:01

[piece of your homework yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m07s)
01:26:07

[question about what is triangles 1/2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m08s)
01:26:08

[that exactly the same as deconvolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m11s)
01:26:11

[strive to so I remember I mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m15s)
01:26:15

[earlier that another name for the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m18s)
01:26:18

[convolution is fractionally straighter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m22s)
01:26:22

[convolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m24s)
01:26:24

[so you can remember that little picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m26s)
01:26:26

[we saw this ideas like you put little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m29s)
01:26:29

[columns and rows of zeros in between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m31s)
01:26:31

[each row and column so that's kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m34s)
01:26:34

[think of it as doing like that ah drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h26m36s)

[material like this you'll often find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h27m08s)

[guys might remember Chris Ola he had a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h28m29s)
01:28:29

[lot of the best kind of learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h28m31s)
01:28:31

[materials we looked at in part one he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h28m34s)
01:28:34

[now got this cool thing for distilled a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h28m36s)

01:28:41

[discovering why is it that everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h28m44s)
01:28:44

[gets these goddamn stackable pens and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h28m47s)
01:28:47

[what he shows is that it happens because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h28m50s)
01:28:50

[you have tried to size three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h28m54s)
01:28:54

[convolutions which means that every pair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h28m59s)
01:28:59

[of convolutions see one pixel price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m01s)
01:29:01

[right so it's like a checkerboard it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m05s)
01:29:05

[just a natural thing that's going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m08s)
01:29:08

[come out and so they talk about you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m10s)
01:29:10

[this in some detail and all the kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m12s)
01:29:12

[things you can do time but in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m14s)
01:29:14

[they point out two things the first is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m17s)
01:29:17

[that you can avoid this by making it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m22s)
01:29:22

[that you're your stride divides nicely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m26s)
01:29:26

[into your size so if I change size to 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m32s)
01:29:32

[click on alright so one thing you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m36s)
01:29:36

[try that you're getting checkable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m40s)
01:29:40

[patterns which you will is make your 5/3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m42s)
01:29:42

[convolutions into clothes for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m46s)
01:29:46

[populations the second thing that he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m48s)
01:29:48

[just doing is not to use the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m51s)
01:29:51

[convolutions instead of using the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m54s)
01:29:54

[deconvolution easy-chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m56s)
01:29:56

[first of all doing an absinthe and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h29m58s)
01:29:58

[happens we do an up sampling is it the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m01s)
01:30:01

[basically the opposite of max for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m03s)
01:30:03

[you take every pixel and you turn it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m05s)
01:30:05

[into a 2x2 grid of that exact pixel okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m08s)
01:30:08

[called up center if you do an up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m13s)
01:30:13

[sampling followed by a regular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m16s)
01:30:16

[convolution and also get rid of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m18s)
01:30:18

[checkerboard pattern and as it happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m21s)
01:30:21

[caris has something to do that which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m24s)
01:30:24

[called it's called up sampling to D so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m29s)
01:30:29

[all this does is kind of the opposite of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m39s)
01:30:39

[next pooling it's going to double the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m41s)
01:30:41

[size of your image at which point you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m43s)
01:30:43

[can use a standard normal units data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m45s)
01:30:45

[convolution and avoid EMS so extra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m48s)

[credit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m52s)
01:30:52

[after you get your network working is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m53s)
01:30:53

[change it to an up sampling and unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m55s)
01:30:55

[straight from pollution Network and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h30m58s)
01:30:58

[a few technical ad packs go away okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m02s)
01:31:02

[that is that at variant here I put some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m07s)

[suggestions system or things that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m11s)
01:31:11

[can look at although most of those were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m12s)
01:31:12

[already in the PowerPoint so there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m15s)
01:31:15

[anything out there okay so let's move on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m18s)

[I want to talk about going be going big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m28s)
01:31:28

[can mean two things of course does mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m35s)
01:31:35

[we can see big data which is important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m38s)
01:31:38

[you have to do that I'm very proud that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m41s)
01:31:41

[even during the big data being I never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m47s)

01:31:58

[need to use either large objects like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h31m59s)

01:32:15

[and ran the kneading tricks so I thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h32m20s)
01:32:20

[we would try some interesting projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h32m22s)

[available forms and using research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h32m43s)

[and blah blah blah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h32m47s)

[in fact if you go out the forum you'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h32m48s)
01:32:48

01:34:14

[kind of weird right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m18s)
01:34:18

[if you happen encoding where similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m22s)
01:34:22

[things were similarly encoding you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m23s)
01:34:23

[do some pretty cool stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m27s)
01:34:27

[and in particular what she was trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m28s)
01:34:28

[do one of the key things you're trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m30s)

[beyond the thousand image net categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m34s)

[images that were not an initiative at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m40s)

[all and so the way she did that was to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m42s)
01:34:42

[see all right let's stroll away the one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m45s)

[part of coder category and let's replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h34m47s)

[of the things I loved about the paper is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m12s)
01:35:12

[that what she does is to show quite an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m13s)

[interesting range of the kind of cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m18s)

[results and cool things you can do when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m20s)
01:35:20

[you replace a one part of credit output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m23s)
01:35:23

[with a vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m25s)
01:35:25

[I just clarify so every pixel one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m31s)
01:35:31

[hard-coded pixel suddenly becomes a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m37s)
01:35:37

[vector was like no pixels not one marker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m39s)

[area pixels are encoded by their canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m42s)

[station no so here the and the lipstick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m50s)
01:35:50

[and let's say this is a image of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h35m54s)

01:36:07

[turned into a 1000 one vector with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m11s)

[zero and a one institution 300 so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m16s)
01:36:16

[normally what we use without that our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m19s)
01:36:19

[target when we're doing a new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m22s)
01:36:22

[certification we're going to throw that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m23s)
01:36:23

[one thousand one thing away and replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m25s)
01:36:25

[it with a three hundred one thing and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m29s)
01:36:29

[the three hundred long thing will be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m32s)
01:36:32

[word vector for pub that we downloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m35s)
01:36:35

[from work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m38s)
01:36:38

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m43s)
01:36:43

[normally we have our input image comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m49s)
01:36:49

[in it goes through some kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m52s)
01:36:52

[computation you know CNN and it has to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h36m58s)
01:36:58

[predict something and normally the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m02s)
01:37:02

[it has to predict there's a whole bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m04s)
01:37:04

[of zeros and a one here and so the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m05s)
01:37:05

[we do that is that the last layer is a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m09s)
01:37:09

[softmax layer which encourages one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m12s)
01:37:12

[the things to be much higher than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m17s)
01:37:17

[others so all we do is we throw that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m18s)
01:37:18

[away and we replace it with the word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m21s)
01:37:21

[vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m27s)
01:37:27

[or that but I think Fox or Pike or jumbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m29s)
01:37:29

[jet and since the word vector so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m33s)
01:37:33

[generally that might be say 300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m35s)
01:37:35

[dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m37s)
01:37:37

[and that's that's dense that's not lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m40s)
01:37:40

[of zeros so we can't use a soft max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m43s)
01:37:43

[layer at the end anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m45s)
01:37:45

[we've probably now just use a regular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m46s)
01:37:46

[linear layer okay so the hard part about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m48s)
01:37:48

[doing this really is processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h37m56s)
01:37:56

[initiative not you know there's nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m00s)
01:38:00

[weird or interesting or tricky about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m02s)
01:38:02

[architecture all we do is print the last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m04s)
01:38:04

[layer and so we're going to leverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m06s)
01:38:06

[them big holes quite one so we start off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m08s)
01:38:08

[by and put in unusual stuff and don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m13s)
01:38:13

[forget the tensor flow to call this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m15s)
01:38:15

[limit men thing I created that if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m16s)
01:38:16

[don't use up all of your memory and one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m18s)
01:38:18

[thing which can be very helpful is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m23s)
01:38:23

[define actually two parts once you cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m25s)
01:38:25

[your own box you've got a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m28s)
01:38:28

[spinning hard disks that are big and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m31s)
01:38:31

[slow and cheap and maybe a couple of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m34s)
01:38:34

[pass expensive small SSDs or nvme drives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m38s)
01:38:38

[so I generally think it's Gladiator to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m43s)
01:38:43

[find a path the boat right one two this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m46s)
01:38:46

[actually happens to be a mount point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m51s)
01:38:51

[that has my big slow it's cheap fitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m52s)
01:38:52

[discs and this past happens to live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h38m58s)
01:38:58

[somewhere which is my fast SSDs and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m00s)
01:39:00

[way throughout my when I'm doing my code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m04s)
01:39:04

[anytime I've got something going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m07s)
01:39:07

[accessing a lot particularly if it's in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m09s)

[a random order and I want to make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m12s)
01:39:12

[that that thing from it's not too big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m14s)
01:39:14

[sits in this path and then he's fine I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m16s)
01:39:16

[accessing something which I'm accessing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m19s)
01:39:19

[generally sequentially or just really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m21s)
01:39:21

[big I can put it in this file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m24s)
01:39:24

[this is one of the good reasons and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m26s)
01:39:26

[other good reason to have your own box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m28s)
01:39:28

[is if you get this kind of activism okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m29s)
01:39:29

[so the first thing we need is some more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m35s)
01:39:35

[vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m37s)
01:39:37

[so interestingly actually the the paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m41s)
01:39:41

[built their own Wikipedia work versus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m45s)
01:39:45

[actually think that the word to vex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m50s)
01:39:50

[vectors you can download from Google are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m53s)
01:39:53

[really maybe a better choice here so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m55s)
01:39:55

[I've just gone ahead and shown how you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h39m59s)
01:39:59

[can load in one of the very nice things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m01s)

[in type one when we use word vectors we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m11s)

[tend to use love-love would not have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m14s)

[word vector for Golden Retriever they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m18s)
01:40:18

[would have a word vector for problem and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m21s)
01:40:21

[they don't have low phrase seen where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m24s)
01:40:24

[else Google's where vectors have phrases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m28s)
01:40:28

[like golden retriever so for our thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m31s)
01:40:31

[we really need to use Google's word to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m34s)
01:40:34

[vet vectors or anything like that which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m37s)
01:40:37

[has like multi-part content as things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m39s)
01:40:39

[that we can look at so you can download](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m43s)
01:40:43

[words of X I will make them available on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h40m46s)

[going to share data why put it in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m20s)
01:41:20

[weird the prior to binary format and a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m23s)
01:41:23

[Google Drive thing you can access two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m24s)
01:41:24

[minutes anyway this guy did so I didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m26s)
01:41:26

[save this text they had a very easy to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m30s)
01:41:30

[work with the work vectors themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m32s)
01:41:32

[are in very simple format they're just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m35s)
01:41:35

[the words followed by a face followed by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m38s)
01:41:38

[the vector space separated I'm going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m41s)
01:41:41

[save them in a simple dictionary format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m45s)
01:41:45

[so what I'm going to share that you guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m51s)
01:41:51

[will be the dictionary the dictionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m53s)
01:41:53

[from word or phrase to an umpire correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h41m54s)
01:41:54

[okay I'm not sure I've used this idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m00s)
01:42:00

[lips are before so I should talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m05s)
01:42:05

[this a little bit so if I put a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m07s)
01:42:07

[dictionary a dictionary which maps from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m09s)
01:42:09

[word to vector how do I get out of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m12s)
01:42:12

[a list of the words and the rest of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m17s)
01:42:17

[vectors the short answer is like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m19s)
01:42:19

[but let's think about what it's do it so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m24s)
01:42:24

[I don't know like we've used it quite a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m27s)
01:42:27

[bit right so normally was if you go like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m29s)
01:42:29

[tip this one plumber list to come up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m31s)
01:42:31

[whatever right and what that returns is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m36s)
01:42:36

[an iterator which first of all gives to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m39s)
01:42:39

[element one of list one element one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m42s)
01:42:42

[this to element one over three and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m45s)
01:42:45

[a two of this one so forth that's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m47s)
01:42:47

[gifts normally does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m49s)
01:42:49

[there's a nice idea in Python that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m53s)
01:42:53

[can put a star before any argument and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h42m57s)
01:42:57

[if that argument is an iterator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m01s)
01:43:01

[something that you can look through it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m05s)
01:43:05

[asks if you had taken that whole list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m07s)
01:43:07

[and actually put it inside those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m10s)
01:43:10

[brackets right so let's say that W to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m14s)
01:43:14

[the list contained like Fox :](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m17s)
01:43:17

[and then some array and there v :](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m22s)
01:43:22

[and then some array and so forth right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m29s)
01:43:29

[when you go zip star that if the same is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m34s)
01:43:34

[actually taking the contents of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m39s)
01:43:39

[list and putting it inside there you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m41s)
01:43:41

[would want star star if it was a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m49s)
01:43:49

[dictionary start for list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m51s)
01:43:51

[not quite start to speed you're treating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m53s)
01:43:53

[as an iterator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h43m58s)
01:43:58

[you're right in this case we are using a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m03s)
01:44:03

[list so that's that's not where so yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m05s)
01:44:05

[you can use let's talk about sales there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m09s)
01:44:09

[another time figure right in this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m11s)
01:44:11

[we have a list which is actually just in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m13s)
01:44:13

[this limited box comma array hug comic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m16s)
01:44:16

[array and then a lot more okay so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m22s)
01:44:22

[is it going to do is when we exist it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m27s)
01:44:27

[it's going to basically take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m30s)
01:44:30

[all of these things and create one risk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m34s)
01:44:34

[to those week onwards and all these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m37s)
01:44:37

[things get one whiff to those myths and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m41s)
01:44:41

[some vectors so this idea of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m44s)
01:44:44

[zip star is something we're going to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m49s)
01:44:49

[quite a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m52s)
01:44:52

[honestly I don't normally like think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m53s)
01:44:53

[about what it's doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m57s)
01:44:57

[I just know that anytime I've got like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h44m58s)
01:44:58

[list of tuples and I want to turn it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m02s)
01:45:02

[into a couple of lists you just do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m04s)
01:45:04

[stuff so and that's all that is just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m08s)
01:45:08

[little Python thing okay so this gives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m11s)
01:45:11

[us a list of words and most effectors so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m14s)
01:45:14

[anytime I start looking at some new data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m18s)
01:45:18

[I always want to test it and so I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m20s)
01:45:20

[to make sure this work the way I thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m25s)
01:45:25

[it ought to work so one thing I thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m26s)
01:45:26

[was okay let's look at the correlation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m28s)
01:45:28

[coefficient between small j2me and each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m30s)
01:45:30

[territory and indeed there is some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m32s)
01:45:32

[correlation she would expect for else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m35s)
01:45:35

[the correlation between Jeremy and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m39s)
01:45:39

[banana I ate bananas so I was hoping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m40s)
01:45:40

[this to be like national be-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m43s)
01:45:43

[unfortunates not but it is at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m45s)
01:45:45

[lower than the correlation between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m47s)
01:45:47

[Jeremy and picture so like okay it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m48s)
01:45:48

[always easy to exactly test data but you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m52s)
01:45:52

[know try and come up with things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m55s)
01:45:55

[want to be true make sure they are true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m56s)
01:45:56

[and so in this case this is giving me to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h45m58s)
01:45:58

[comfort that these word vectors behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m01s)
01:46:01

[where expect them to now I don't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m03s)
01:46:03

[care about capitalization so let's go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m07s)
01:46:07

[ahead and create a lowercase word to Vic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m09s)
01:46:09

[dictionary whereas through the lowercase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m12s)
01:46:12

[version for everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m14s)
01:46:14

[one trick here is I go through in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m18s)
01:46:18

[Reverse and because word to Vic is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m20s)
01:46:20

[ordered where the most common words at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m23s)
01:46:23

[first so they're going in Reverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m26s)
01:46:26

[it means if there is but the capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m28s)
01:46:28

[h-i-m unit small Jeremy the one is going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m30s)
01:46:30

[to end up in my dictionary will be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m33s)
01:46:33

[more common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m34s)
01:46:34

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m39s)
01:46:39

[what I want to divide is to now get this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m42s)
01:46:42

[work vector for each one of our 1000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m46s)
01:46:46

[categories in image 10 and then I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m49s)
01:46:49

[going to go even further than that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m54s)
01:46:54

[because I want to go beyond image net so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m56s)
01:46:56

[I actually went and downloaded the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h46m58s)
01:46:58

[original word net categories and they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m00s)
01:47:00

[filled it down to find all the noun and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m04s)
01:47:04

[I discovered that they're actually 18 mm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m06s)
01:47:06

[now in work which is quite a few it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m09s)
01:47:09

[quite fun looking through them so I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m13s)
01:47:13

[going to create a map of word vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m15s)
01:47:15

[for every image net category we once s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m17s)
01:47:17

[and every word net noun that'll be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m20s)
01:47:20

[another set and so my goal in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m23s)
01:47:23

[project will be to try and create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m25s)
01:47:25

[something that can do useful things with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m26s)
01:47:26

[the full set of word net now we don't go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m29s)
01:47:29

[beyond the internet we've already got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m32s)
01:47:32

[the a thousand Usenet categories we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m34s)
01:47:34

[used setting a sensor for software those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m36s)
01:47:36

[bug min um I can okay and then I do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m38s)
01:47:38

[same thing for the full set word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m45s)
01:47:45

[entities which I will share with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m49s)
01:47:49

[and so now I can go ahead and create a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m54s)
01:47:54

[dictionary which goes through every one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h47m58s)
01:47:58

[of my every one of my imagenet thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m01s)
01:48:01

[categories and converts it into the word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m05s)
01:48:05

[vector and notice I have a filter here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m10s)
01:48:10

[and that's because some of the imagenet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m12s)
01:48:12

[categories won't be in words of X and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m17s)
01:48:17

[that's because like sometimes the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m22s)
01:48:22

[imagenet categories will say things like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m24s)
01:48:24

[target bracket doc you know they won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m26s)
01:48:26

[be exactly in the same format if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m29s)
01:48:29

[wanted to you could probably get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m32s)
01:48:32

[better match than this but I found even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m34s)
01:48:34

[with this simple approach they managed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m36s)
01:48:36

[to match 50 1600 out of the 82,000 worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m38s)
01:48:38

[net nouns which I thought was pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m43s)
01:48:43

[good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m46s)
01:48:46

[so what I did then was they created a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m47s)
01:48:47

[list of all of the categories which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m50s)
01:48:50

[didn't match and this come into the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m53s)
01:48:53

[outfit as you can see is something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m56s)
01:48:56

[that's literally just moved those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h48m58s)
01:48:58

[folders out of the way so that they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m00s)
01:49:00

[not in my internship path anymore okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m03s)
01:49:03

[so the details are very important but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m07s)
01:49:07

[hopefully you can see at the end of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m10s)
01:49:10

[process I've got something that masks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m12s)
01:49:12

[every imagenet category - a word vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m14s)
01:49:14

[as estimated - and every word net noun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m17s)
01:49:17

[to a vector at least if I hit then find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m21s)
01:49:21

[it and that I've modified my image net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m24s)
01:49:24

[data so that the categories I couldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m28s)
01:49:28

[find I move those borders out of there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m32s)
01:49:32

[okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m34s)
01:49:34

[nothing particularly interesting there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m37s)
01:49:37

[and that's because wasn't it's not the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m41s)
01:49:41

[thing just in there that's pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m45s)
01:49:45

[straightforward the image is a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m47s)
01:49:47

[harder because we've got you know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m49s)
01:49:49

[million or so images so we're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m51s)
01:49:51

[try everything we can to make this run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m54s)
01:49:54

[as quickly as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h49m57s)
01:49:57

[so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m01s)
01:50:01

[to start with even the very process of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m04s)
01:50:04

[getting a list of the file names that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m09s)
01:50:09

[everything an image set takes a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m11s)
01:50:11

[non-trivial amount of time so like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m14s)
01:50:14

[everything it takes a non-trivial and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m16s)
01:50:16

[time going to save its output okay so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m17s)
01:50:17

[the first thing I do is I use a blob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m20s)
01:50:20

[blob I can't really figure slop in part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m23s)
01:50:23

[one I think we did yeah is this the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m26s)
01:50:26

[thing that's like LS star dot star press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m28s)
01:50:28

[sort of lot so we use plod to grab all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m30s)
01:50:30

[of the internet training set and then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m34s)
01:50:34

[just go ahead people don't then fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m37s)
01:50:37

[and people don't lower their so there is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m43s)
01:50:43

[recent we'll see shortly it's actually a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m47s)
01:50:47

[very good idea though at this point to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m50s)
01:50:50

[randomize that Mister farmers put them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m52s)
01:50:52

[in a random order the basic idea is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m54s)
01:50:54

[later on if we use a chance to file name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h50m57s)
01:50:57

[to the next to each other they're not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m02s)
01:51:02

[all going to be the same type of seed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m04s)
01:51:04

[okay so by randomizing the file names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m07s)
01:51:07

[now in a very sort of time but then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m09s)
01:51:09

[can go ahead and save that randomized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m12s)
01:51:12

[yes again is different then when we come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m13s)
01:51:13

[back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m17s)
01:51:17

[so I want to resize all of my images to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m19s)
01:51:19

[a concise I'm being a bit lazy here and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m21s)
01:51:21

[then a green size in two to three foot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m25s)
01:51:25

[by two 24 that's the input size for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m27s)
01:51:27

[lot of models obviously to the one that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m30s)
01:51:30

[we're going to use and would prolly be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m35s)
01:51:35

[better if we resize to something bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m37s)
01:51:37

[and then we like randomly zoom and crop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m40s)
01:51:40

[maybe if we have time we'll we'll try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m44s)
01:51:44

[that later but so now we're just going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m47s)
01:51:47

[to use resize everything into 24 by 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m50s)
01:51:50

[okay so we have a nearly a million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m54s)
01:51:54

[images it turns out to resize to 24 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h51m57s)
01:51:57

[to 24 that could be pretty slow so I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m00s)
01:52:00

[got some handy tricks to make it much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m05s)
01:52:05

[faster generally speaking there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m08s)
01:52:08

[three ways to make an algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m12s)
01:52:12

[significantly faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m16s)
01:52:16

[the three ways are cash a memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m21s)
01:52:21

[locality to explain these Mohammed and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m27s)
01:52:27

[locality second is Cindy also known as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m32s)
01:52:32

[vectorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m44s)
01:52:44

[the third is parallel processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m50s)
01:52:50

[so Rachel's very familiar with these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h52m57s)
01:52:57

[this is currently creating a course for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m00s)
01:53:00

[the master students here on numerical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m04s)
01:53:04

[linear algebra which is like very happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m06s)
01:53:06

[about these things so these are the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m08s)
01:53:08

[three ways you can make data processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m10s)
01:53:10

[faster memory locality simply means in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m13s)
01:53:13

[your computer you have lots of different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m16s)
01:53:16

[kinds of memory you have for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m17s)
01:53:17

[level 1 cache level 2 cache Ram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m20s)
01:53:20

[subjective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m28s)
01:53:28

[regular or hard drives the difference in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m31s)
01:53:31

[speed as you go up from one to the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m38s)
01:53:38

[is generally like 10 times or 100 times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m40s)
01:53:40

[or thousands owners floor like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m44s)
01:53:44

[really really really don't want to go to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m47s)
01:53:47

[the next level of the memory hierarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m48s)
01:53:48

[if you can avoid it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m50s)
01:53:50

[unfortunately level 1 cache might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m52s)
01:53:52

[more like 16 K level two caches might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m55s)
01:53:55

[a few milk brands going to be a cube gig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h53m59s)
01:53:59

[solid safe drives is really going to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m03s)
01:54:03

[a few hundreds of gig and your hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m05s)
01:54:05

[drives are probably going to be apt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m08s)
01:54:08

[reminders so in reality you've got to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m09s)
01:54:09

[careful that elevators so you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m12s)
01:54:12

[try and make sure that you're putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m15s)
01:54:15

[stuff in the right place and if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m18s)
01:54:18

[not filling up the resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m20s)
01:54:20

[unnecessarily and that if you use if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m22s)
01:54:22

[you're going to use piece of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m25s)
01:54:25

[multiple times try to use it each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m27s)
01:54:27

[like immediately use it again so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m30s)
01:54:30

[it's already in your cache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m33s)
01:54:33

[the second thing which is what we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m37s)
01:54:37

[about to look look at is SIMD which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m39s)
01:54:39

[stands for single instruction multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m42s)
01:54:42

[data something that a shockingly large](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m43s)
01:54:43

[number of people even who plan to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m47s)
01:54:47

[professional computer programmers don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m50s)
01:54:50

[know is that every modern CPU is capable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m52s)
01:54:52

[of in a single operation in a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h54m57s)
01:54:57

[thread calculating multiple things at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m02s)
01:55:02

[the same time and the way that it does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m04s)
01:55:04

[it is that you basically create a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m06s)
01:55:06

[vector generally about eight things okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m09s)
01:55:09

[and you put all the things you want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m12s)
01:55:12

[calculate so you want to take the square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m14s)
01:55:14

[root of something you put eight things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m16s)
01:55:16

[into this little vector and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m17s)
01:55:17

[call a particular CTU instruction which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m22s)
01:55:22

[is basically a take the square root of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m24s)
01:55:24

[eight floating-point numbers that is in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m28s)
01:55:28

[this register and it does it in a single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m30s)
01:55:30

[clock cycle so when it's a clock cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m33s)
01:55:33

[you know your CPU IV say is 2 or 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m35s)
01:55:35

[gigahertz and so it's doing 2 or 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m39s)
01:55:39

[billion things per second whatnot it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m41s)
01:55:41

[doing 2 or 3 billion times eight things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h55m45s)
01:55:45

[written stuff in C which does use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h57m25s)

[interfaces okay so this is something to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h57m30s)
01:57:30

[remember to try to get working when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h57m33s)

[faster first ER and one is how could you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h57m55s)
01:57:55

[get the relation between a pug and a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m00s)
01:58:00

[and the photo of a pug and it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m02s)
01:58:02

[which is a bigger category of dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m05s)
01:58:05

[yes sure we'll think about that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m11s)
01:58:11

[there why do we want to randomize the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m15s)
01:58:15

[file names can't we use shuffle equals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m18s)

[you'll see ya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m24s)
01:58:24

[the short answer is kind of to do with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m26s)

[hardest and I just take that like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m35s)
01:58:35

[literally the rivers a sitting disk with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m37s)
01:58:37

[a little needle we are looking moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m40s)
01:58:40

[all over the place so you want to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m42s)
01:58:42

[getting things all over the first unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m43s)
01:58:43

[as you'll see this is going to basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m47s)
01:58:47

[work for a competitive dog this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m52s)
01:58:52

[parked because he words act as a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m54s)
01:58:54

[it's very similar to what go to the park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m57s)
01:58:57

[so at the end we'll try it we'll try and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h58m59s)
01:58:59

[we'll see if we can find and box the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m01s)
01:59:01

[other workers I'm sure it will finally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m05s)
01:59:05

[it is parallel processing parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m09s)
01:59:09

[processing refers to simply as you all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m11s)
01:59:11

[know any modern CPU has multiple cores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m13s)
01:59:13

[which literally means multiple CPUs in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m18s)
01:59:18

[your CPU and often boxes that you both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m21s)
01:59:21

[are might even have multiple CPUs in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m26s)
01:59:26

[again pythons not great for parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m30s)
01:59:30

[processing plant and three is certainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m34s)
01:59:34

[much better but a lot of stuff in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m35s)
01:59:35

[doesn't use parallel processing very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m38s)
01:59:38

[effectively but a lot of modern CPUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m40s)
01:59:40

[have ten cords or more even for you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m44s)
01:59:44

[consumer CPU so if you're not using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m47s)
01:59:47

[parallel processing you're missing out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m50s)
01:59:50

[on a 10 X theta if you're not using SIMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m52s)
01:59:52

[you're missing out on a 6 to 8 X theta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m55s)
01:59:55

[ok so if you can do both of these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=01h59m58s)
01:59:58

[you can get 50 plugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m01s)
02:00:01

[I mean you will you'll get 50 plus B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m03s)
02:00:03

[then assuming your CPU has a nut cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m05s)
02:00:05

[so we're going to do both to get this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m09s)
02:00:09

[AMD we're just going to install it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m11s)
02:00:11

[to get parallel processing and probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m13s)
02:00:13

[not there see all of us say but we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m15s)
02:00:15

[going to be using parallel processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m17s)
02:00:17

[so I define a few things to do my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m20s)
02:00:20

[resizing one thing is I've actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m25s)
02:00:25

[recently changed how I do resizing as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m29s)
02:00:29

[I'm sure you guys have noticed in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m32s)
02:00:32

[past when I resize things to square I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m34s)
02:00:34

[tended to add a black border to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m36s)
02:00:36

[bottom or a black border to the right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m39s)
02:00:39

[because that's what Care Act is now that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m41s)
02:00:41

[I've looked into it like no best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m45s)
02:00:45

[practice tapers cackled result in adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m48s)
02:00:48

[use that way and it makes perfect sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m51s)
02:00:51

[because the cnn's that has like learns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m53s)
02:00:53

[deal with the black border and you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m56s)
02:00:56

[throwing away all that information and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h00m59s)
02:00:59

[what pretty much all the best practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m01s)
02:01:01

[approach use is to rather than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m03s)
02:01:03

[reschedule the longest side to be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m07s)
02:01:07

[size of your square and then fill it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m10s)
02:01:10

[with black instead take the smallest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m12s)
02:01:12

[side and make that the size of your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m15s)
02:01:15

[square the other side's now too big to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m17s)
02:01:17

[just chop off the top and bottom or top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m20s)
02:01:20

[off the rival right and left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m23s)
02:01:23

[that's called center cropping so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m24s)
02:01:24

[resizing and center protein so what I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m27s)
02:01:27

[done here is I've got something which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m31s)
02:01:31

[resizes to the size of the shortest side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m32s)
02:01:32

[and then over here somewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m38s)
02:01:38

[over here I've got something which does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m44s)
02:01:44

[the center cropping you can look at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m46s)
02:01:46

[details from your own if you like not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m50s)
02:01:50

[particularly exciting so I've put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m52s)
02:01:52

[something about the resizing this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m55s)
02:01:55

[something you can improve currently I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h01m58s)
02:01:58

[making sure that it's a three channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h02m00s)
02:02:00

[image and so I'm not getting a black and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h02m02s)
02:02:02

[white or something with an alpha Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h02m04s)
02:02:04

[just ignore there okay so before I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h02m06s)
02:02:06

[finish up is I think about opponents so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h02m13s)
02:02:13

[what we're going to learn next time when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-P363wSv0Q#t=02h02m16s)
